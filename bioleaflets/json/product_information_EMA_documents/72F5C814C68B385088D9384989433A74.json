NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYargesa 100 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 100 mg miglustat. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nThe hard capsule consists of an opaque white cap and body with “708” printed in black on the body. \nCapsule Size: 4 (14.3 mm x 5.3 mm) \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nYargesa is indicated for the oral treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease. \nYargesa may be used only in the treatment of patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nYargesa is indicated for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult patients and \npaediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (see sections 4.4, and 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be directed by physicians who are knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher disease or \nNiemann-Pick type C disease, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nDosage in type 1 Gaucher disease \n \nAdult \n \nThe recommended starting dose for the treatment of adult patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease is 100 mg \nthree times a day. \n \nTemporary dose reduction to 100 mg once or twice a day may be necessary in some patients because of \ndiarrhoea.   \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe efficacy of Yargesa in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years with type 1 Gaucher disease has not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nDosage in Niemann-Pick type C disease \nAdult \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease is 200 mg three \ntimes a day. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with Niemann-\nPick type C disease is 200 mg three times a day. \n \nDosing in patients under the age of 12 years should be adjusted on the basis of body surface area as \nillustrated below: \n\nBody surface area (m2)  Recommended dose \n> 1.25 200 mg three times a day \n> 0.88 - 1.25 200 mg twice a day \n> 0.73 - 0.88 100 mg three times a day \n> 0.47 - 0.73 100 mg twice a day \n≤ 0.47 100 mg once a day \n\n \nTemporary dose reduction may be necessary in some patients because of diarrhoea. \nThe benefit to the patient of treatment with Yargesa should be evaluated on a regular basis (see section 4.4). \nThere is limited experience with the use of Yargesa in Niemann-Pick type C disease patients under the age of \n4 years. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no experience with the use of Yargesa in patients over the age of 70. \n \nRenal Impairment  \nPharmacokinetic data indicate increased systemic exposure to miglustat in patients with renal impairment. In \npatients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 50–70 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration should commence at \na dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of 200 mg twice daily \n(adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with Niemann-Pick type C \ndisease.  \n \nIn patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 30–50 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration should commence \nat a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of 100 mg twice daily \n(adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with Niemann-Pick type C \ndisease. Use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic Impairment \nYargesa has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nYargesa can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTremor \nApproximately 37% of patients in clinical trials in type 1 Gaucher disease, and 58% of patients in a \n\n\n\n4 \n\nclinical trial in Niemann-Pick type C disease reported tremor on treatment. In type 1 Gaucher disease, these \ntremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands. Tremor usually began within \nthe first month, and in many cases resolved during treatment after between 1 and 3 months. Dose reduction \nmay ameliorate the tremor, usually within days, but discontinuation of treatment may sometimes be required.  \n \nGastrointestinal disturbances \nGastrointestinal events, mainly diarrhoea, have been observed in more than 80% of patients, either at the \noutset of treatment or intermittently during treatment (see section 4.8). The mechanism is most likely \ninhibition of intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase-isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract leading to \nreduced absorption of dietary disaccharides. In clinical practice, miglustat-induced gastrointestinal events \nhave been observed to respond to individualised diet modification (for example reduction of sucrose, lactose \nand other carbohydrate intake), to taking miglustat between meals, and/or to anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproducts such as loperamide. In some patients, temporary dose reduction may be necessary. Patients with \nchronic diarrhoea or other persistent gastrointestinal events that do not respond to these interventions should \nbe investigated according to clinical practice. Miglustat has not been evaluated in patients with a history of \nsignificant gastrointestinal disease, including inflammatory bowel disease.  \n \nEffects on spermatogenesis \nMale patients should maintain reliable contraceptive methods while taking Yargesa. Studies in the rat have \nshown that miglustat adversely affects spermatogenesis and sperm parameters, and reduces fertility (see \nsections 4.6 and 5.3). Until further information is available, before seeking to conceive, male patients should \ncease Yargesa and maintain reliable contraceptive methods for a further 3 months.  \n \nSpecial populations \nDue to limited experience, Yargesa should be used with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \nThere is a close relationship between renal function and clearance of miglustat, and exposure to miglustat is \nmarkedly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). At present, there is insufficient \nclinical experience in these patients to provide dosing recommendations. Use of Yargesa in patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not recommended.  \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \nAlthough no direct comparisons with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) have been performed in \ntreatment-naive patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, there is no evidence of miglustat having an efficacy or \nsafety advantage over ERT. ERT is the standard of care for patients who require treatment for type 1 \nGaucher disease (see section 5.1). The efficacy and safety of miglustat has not been specifically evaluated in \npatients with severe Gaucher disease.  \n \nRegular monitoring of vitamin B12 level is recommended because of the high prevalence of vitamin B12 \ndeficiency in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.  \n \nCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with miglustat with or without \nconcurrent conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency and monoclonal gammopathy. Peripheral neuropathy \nseems to be more common in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease compared to the general population. All \npatients should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluation.  \n \nIn patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, monitoring of platelet counts is recommended. Mild reductions in \nplatelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who \nwere switched from ERT to miglustat. \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Yargesa for neurological manifestations in patients with Niemann-Pick type C \ndisease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation of therapy should be re-\nappraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Yargesa. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMild reductions in platelet counts without association to bleeding were observed in some patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease treated with Yargesa. In patients included in the clinical trial, 40%-50% of \npatients had platelet counts below the lower limit of normal at baseline. Monitoring of platelet counts is \nrecommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nReduced growth has been reported in some paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease in the early \nphase of treatment with miglustat where the initial reduced weight gain may be accompanied or followed by \nreduced height gain. Growth should be monitored in paediatric and adolescent patients during treatment with \nYargesa; the benefit/risk balance should be re-assessed on an individual basis for continuation of therapy. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLimited data suggest that co-administration of miglustat and enzyme replacement with imiglucerase in \npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate reductions \nof 22% in Cmax and 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel-group study). This study also indicated \nthat miglustat has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of imiglucerase. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of miglustat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity, including dystocia (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nMiglustat crosses the placenta and should not be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known if miglustat is secreted in breast milk. Yargesa should not be taken during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \nStudies in the rat have shown that miglustat adversely affects sperm parameters (motility and morphology) \nthereby reducing fertility (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Until further information is available, it is advised that \nbefore seeking to conceive, male patients should cease Yargesa and maintain reliable contraceptive methods \nfor 3 months thereafter.  \n \nContraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential. Male patients should maintain \nreliable contraceptive methods while taking Yargesa (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nYargesa has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported as a \ncommon adverse reaction, and patients suffering from dizziness should not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with miglustat were diarrhoea, flatulence, \nabdominal pain, weight loss and tremor (see section 4.4). The most common serious adverse reaction \nreported with miglustat treatment in clinical studies was peripheral neuropathy (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn 11 clinical trials in different indications 247 patients were treated with miglustat at dosages of 50-200 mg \nt.i.d. for an average duration of 2.1 years. Of these patients, 132 had type 1 Gaucher disease, and 40 had \nNiemann-Pick type C disease. Adverse reactions were generally of mild to moderate severity and occurred \nwith similar frequency across indications and dosages tested.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous reporting, occurring in >1% of patients, are listed in \nthe table below by system organ class and frequency (very common: ≥  1/10, common: ≥ 1/100 < 1/10, \nuncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100, rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000, very rare: <1/10,000). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common Weight loss, decreased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon Depression, insomnia, libido decreased \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common Tremor, \n\nCommon Peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, amnesia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, \ndizziness \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain \n\nCommon Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, dyspepsia \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Muscle spasms, muscle weakness \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site reactions \n\nCommon Fatigue, asthenia, chills and malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nCommon Nerve conduction studies abnormal \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nWeight loss has been reported in 55% of patients using miglustat. The greatest prevalence was observed \nbetween 6 and 12 months.  \n \nMiglustat has been studied in indications where certain events reported as adverse reactions, such as \nneurological and neuropsychological symptoms/signs, cognitive dysfunction and thrombocytopenia could \nalso be due to the underlying conditions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nNo acute symptoms of overdose have been identified. Miglustat has been administered at doses of up to \n3000 mg/day for up to six months in HIV positive patients during clinical trials. Adverse events observed \nincluded granulocytopenia, dizziness and paraesthesia. Leukopenia and neutropenia have also been observed \nin a similar group of patients receiving 800 mg/day or higher dose.  \n \nManagement \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nIn case of overdose general medical care is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC Code: A16AX06 \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \nGaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a failure to degrade glucosylceramide resulting \nin lysosomal storage of this material and widespread pathology. Miglustat is an inhibitor of glucosylceramide \nsynthase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the synthesis of most glycolipids. In vitro, \nglucosylceramide synthase is inhibited by miglustat with an IC50 of 20-37 µM. In addition, inhibitory action \non a non-lysosomal glycosylceramidase has been demonstrated experimentally in vitro. The inhibitory action \non glucosylceramide synthase forms the rationale for substrate reduction therapy in Gaucher disease. \n \nThe pivotal trial of miglustat was conducted in patients unable or unwilling to receive ERT. Reasons for not \nreceiving ERT included the burden of intravenous infusions and difficulties in venous access. Twenty-eight \npatients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease were enrolled in this 12-month non-comparative \nstudy, and 22 patients completed the study. At 12 months, there was a mean reduction in liver organ volume \nof 12.1% and a mean reduction in spleen volume of 19.0%. A mean increase in haemoglobin concentration \nof 0.26 g/dl and a mean platelet count increase of 8.29 × 109/l were observed. Eighteen patients then \ncontinued to receive miglustat under an optional extended treatment protocol. Clinical benefit has been \nassessed at 24 and 36 months in 13 patients. After 3 years of continuous miglustat treatment, mean \nreductions in liver and spleen organ volume were 17.5% and 29.6%, respectively. There was a mean increase \nof 22.2 × 109/l in platelet count, and a mean increase of 0.95 g/dl in haemoglobin concentration.  \n \nA second open, controlled study of miglustat randomised 36 patients who had received a minimum of 2 \nyears of treatment with ERT, into three treatment groups: continuation with imiglucerase, imiglucerase in \ncombination with miglustat, or switch to miglustat. This study was conducted over a 6-month randomised \ncomparison period followed by 18 months extension where all patients received miglustat monotherapy. In \nthe first 6 months in patients who were switched to miglustat, liver and spleen organ volumes and \nhaemoglobin levels were unchanged. In some patients there were reductions in platelet count and increases in \nchitotriosidase activity indicating that miglustat monotherapy may not maintain the same control of disease \nactivity in all patients. 29 patients continued in the extension period. When compared to the measurements at \n6 months, disease control was unchanged after 18 and 24 months of miglustat monotherapy (20 and 6 \npatients, respectively). No patient showed rapid deterioration of type 1 Gaucher disease following the switch \nto miglustat monotherapy.  \n \nA total daily dose of 300 mg miglustat administered in three divided doses was used in the above two \nstudies. An additional monotherapy study was performed in 18 patients at a total daily dose of 150 mg, and \nresults indicate reduced efficacy compared to a total daily dose of 300 mg.  \n \nAn open-label, non-comparative, 2-year study enrolled 42 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, who had \nreceived a minimum of 3 years of ERT and who fulfilled criteria of stable disease for at least 2 years. The \npatients were switched to monotherapy with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. Liver volume (primary efficacy variable) \nwas unchanged from baseline to the end of treatment. Six patients had miglustat treatment prematurely \ndiscontinued for potential disease worsening, as defined in the study. Thirteen patients discontinued \ntreatment due to an adverse event. Small mean reductions in haemoglobin [–0.95 g/dL \n(95% CI: -1.38, -0.53)] and platelet count [-44.1 × 109/L (95% CI: –57.6, –30.7)] were observed between \nbaseline and end of study. Twenty-one patients completed 24 months of miglustat treatment. Of these, 18 \npatients at baseline were within established therapeutic goals for liver and spleen volume, haemoglobin \nlevels, and platelet counts, and 16 patients remained within all these therapeutic goals at Month 24.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBone manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease were evaluated in 3 open-label clinical studies in patients \ntreated with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. for up to 2 years (n = 72). In a pooled analysis of uncontrolled data, bone \nmineral density Z-scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck increased by more than 0.1 units from \nbaseline in 27 (57%) and 28 (65%) of the patients with longitudinal bone density measurements. There were \nno events of bone crisis, avascular necrosis or fracture during the treatment period. \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease is a very rare, invariably progressive and eventually fatal neurodegenerative \ndisorder characterised by impaired intracellular lipid trafficking. The neurological manifestations are \nconsidered secondary to the abnormal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in neuronal and glial cells. \n \nData to support safety and efficacy of Yargesa in Niemann-Pick type C disease come from a prospective \nopen-label clinical trial and a retrospective survey. The clinical trial included 29 adult and juvenile patients \nin a 12-month controlled period, followed by extension therapy for an average total duration of 3.9 years and \nup to 5.6 years. In addition 12 paediatric patients were enrolled in an uncontrolled substudy for an overall \naverage duration of 3.1 years and up to 4.4 years. Among the 41 patients enrolled in the trial 14 patients were \ntreated with Yargesa for more than 3 years. The survey included a case series of 66 patients treated with \nYargesa outside of the clinical trial for a mean duration of 1.5 years. Both data sets included paediatric, \nadolescent and adult patients with an age range of 1 year to 43 years. The usual dose of Yargesa in adult \npatients was 200 mg t.i.d., and was adjusted according to body surface area in paediatric patients. \n \nOverall the data show that treatment with Yargesa can reduce the progression of clinically relevant \nneurological symptoms in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Yargesa for neurological manifestations in patients with Niemann-Pick type C \ndisease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation of therapy should be re-\nappraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Yargesa, (see section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of miglustat were assessed in healthy subjects, in a small number of patients \nwith type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, HIV-infected patients, and in adults, adolescents and children \nwith Niemann-Pick type C disease or type 3 Gaucher disease.  \n \nThe kinetics of miglustat appear to be dose linear and time independent. In healthy subjects miglustat is \nrapidly absorbed. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached about 2 hours after dose. Absolute \nbioavailability has not been determined. Concomitant administration of food decreases the rate of absorption \n(Cmax was decreased by 36% and tmax delayed 2 hours), but has no statistically significant effect on the extent \nof absorption of miglustat (AUC decreased by 14%).  \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of miglustat is 83 l. Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins. \nMiglustat is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, with urinary recovery of unchanged drug accounting for \n70-80% of the dose. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is 230 ± 39 ml/min. The average half-life is 6–7 hours. \n \nFollowing administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14C-miglustat to healthy volunteers, 83% of the \nradioactivity was recovered in urine and 12% in faeces. Several metabolites were identified in urine and \nfaeces. The most abundant metabolite in urine was miglustat glucuronide accounting for 5% of the dose. The \nterminal half-life of radioactivity in plasma was 150 h suggesting the presence of one or more metabolites \nwith very long half-life. The metabolite accounting for this has not been identified, but may accumulate and \nreach concentrations exceeding those of miglustat at steady state.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of miglustat is similar in adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients and \nNiemann-Pick type C disease patients when compared to healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic data were obtained in paediatric patients with type 3 Gaucher disease aged 3 to 15 years, \nand patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease aged 5–16 years. Dosing in children at 200 mg t.i.d. adjusted \nfor body surface area resulted in Cmax and AUCτ values which were approximately twofold those attained \nafter 100 mg t.i.d. in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, consistent with the doselinear pharmacokinetics of \nmiglustat. At steady state, the concentration of miglustat in cerebrospinal fluid of six type 3 Gaucher disease \npatients was 31.4-67.2% of that in plasma. \n \nLimited data in patients with Fabry disease and impaired renal function showed that CL/F decreases with \ndecreasing renal function. While the numbers of subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment were \nvery small, the data suggest an approximate decrease in CL/F of 40% and 60% respectively, in mild and \nmoderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). Data in severe renal impairment are limited to two patients with \ncreatinine clearance in the range 18 – 29 ml/min and cannot be extrapolated below this range. These data \nsuggest a decrease in CL/F by at least 70% in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nOver the range of data available, no significant relationships or trends were noted between miglustat \npharmacokinetic parameters and demographic variables (age, BMI, gender or race). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data available in patients with liver impairment, in children or adolescents \nwith type 1 Gaucher disease or in the elderly (> 70 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe main effects common to all species were weight loss and diarrhoea, and, at higher doses, damage to the \ngastrointestinal mucosa (erosions and ulceration). Further effects seen in animals at doses that result in \nexposure levels similar to or moderately higher than the clinical exposure level were: changes in lymphoid \norgans in all species tested, transaminase changes, vacuolation of thyroid and pancreas, cataracts, \nnephropathy and myocardial changes in rats. These findings were considered to be secondary to debilitation. \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats by oral gavage for 2 years at dose \nlevels of 30, 60 and 180 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell (Leydig \ncell) hyperplasia and adenomas in male rats at all dose levels. The systemic exposure at the lowest dose was \nbelow or comparable to that observed in humans (based on AUC0-∞) at the recommended human dose. A No \nObserved Effect Level (NOEL) was not established and the effect was not dose dependent. There was no \ndrug-related increase in tumour incidence in male or female rats in any other organ. Mechanistic studies \nrevealed a rat specific mechanism which is considered to be of low relevance for humans.  \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female CD1 mice by oral gavage at dose levels of 210, 420 and \n840/500 mg/kg/day (dose reduction after half a year) for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence of \ninflammatory and hyperplastic lesions in the large intestine in both sexes. Based on mg/kg/day and corrected \nfor differences in faecal excretion, the doses corresponded to 8, 16 and 33/19 times the highest recommended \nhuman dose (200 mg t.i.d.). Carcinomas in the large intestine occurred occasionally at all doses with a \nstatistically significant increase in the high dose group. A relevance of these findings to humans cannot be \nexcluded. There was no drug-related increase in tumour incidence in any other organ. \n \nMiglustat did not show any potential for mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the standard battery of \ngenotoxicity tests.  \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats showed effects on the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. Other \nstudies revealed changes in sperm parameters (motility and morphology) consistent with an observed \nreduction in fertility. These effects occurred at exposure levels similar to those in patients, but showed \nreversibility. Miglustat affected embryo/foetal survival in rats and rabbits, dystocia was reported, post-\nimplantation losses were increased, and an increased incidence of vascular anomalies occurred in rabbits. \nThese effects may be partly related to maternal toxicity.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nChanges in lactation were observed in female rats in a 1-year study. The mechanism for this effect is \nunknown. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nYargesa 100 mg hard capsules \nMiglustat \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Yargesa is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Yargesa  \n3. How to take Yargesa  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Yargesa  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Yargesa is and what it is used for \n \nYargesa contains the active substance miglustat which belongs to a group of medicines that affect \nmetabolism. It is used to treat two conditions: \n \n• Yargesa is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. \n\n \nIn type 1 Gaucher disease, a substance called glucosylceramide is not removed from your body. It starts to \nbuild up in certain cells of the body’s immune system. This can result in liver and spleen enlargement, \nchanges in the blood and bone disease. \n \nThe usual treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy. Yargesa is only used when a \npatient is considered unsuitable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. \n \n• Yargesa is also used to treat progressive neurological symptoms in Niemann-Pick type C disease \n\nin adults and in children. \n \nIf you have Niemann-Pick type C disease, fats such as glycosphingolipids build up in the cells of your brain. \nThis can result in disturbances in neurological functions such as slow eye movements, balance, swallowing, \nand memory, and in seizures. \n \nYargesa works by inhibiting the enzyme called ‘glucosylceramide synthase’ which is responsible for the first \nstep in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Yargesa \n \nDo not take Yargesa \n- if you are allergic to miglustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Yargesa \n\n\n\n21 \n\n• if you suffer from kidney disease \n• if you suffer from liver disease \n\n \nYour doctor will perform the following tests before treatment and during treatment with Yargesa \n\n• an examination to check the nerves in your arms and legs \n• measurement of vitamin B12 levels \n• monitoring growth if you are a child or adolescent with Niemann-Pick type C disease \n• monitoring of blood platelet counts \n\n \nThe reason for these tests is that some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, or a \ndecrease in body weight, while taking Yargesa. The tests will help the doctor decide whether these effects \nare due to your disease or other existing conditions, or due to side effects of Yargesa (see section 4 for \nfurther details). \n \nIf you have diarrhoea, your doctor may ask you to change your diet to reduce your lactose and carbohydrate \nintake such as sucrose (cane sugar), or not to take Yargesa together with food, or to temporarily reduce your \ndose. In some cases the doctor may prescribe anti-diarrhoeal medicines such as loperamide. If your diarrhoea \ndoes not respond to these measures, or if you have any other abdominal complaint, consult your doctor. In \nsuch case, your doctor may decide to conduct further investigations. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Yargesa and for 3 months \nafter finishing treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents (below 18 years old) with type 1 Gaucher disease \nbecause it is not known if it works in this disease. \n \nOther medicines and Yargesa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing imiglucerase, which are sometimes used at the same \ntime as Yargesa. They may lower the amount of Yargesa in your body. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou should not take Yargesa if you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant. Your doctor can give \nyou more information. You must use effective birth control while taking Yargesa. Do not breast-feed while \nyou are taking Yargesa. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Yargesa and for 3 months \nafter finishing treatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant, breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYargesa may make you feel dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy. \n \n \n3. How to take Yargesa \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist  if you \nare not sure.  \n \nDosage \n• For type 1 Gaucher disease: For adults, the usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) three times a day \n\n(morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily maximum of three capsules (300 mg). \n\n\n\n22 \n\n• For Niemann-Pick type C disease: For adults and adolescents (over 12 years old), the usual dose is \ntwo capsules (200 mg) three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily \nmaximum of six capsules (600 mg). \n\n \nFor children less than 12 years old, your doctor will adjust the dose for Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nIf you have a problem with your kidneys you may receive a lower starting dose. Your doctor may reduce \nyour dose, e.g., to one capsule (100 mg) once or twice a day, if you suffer from diarrhoea when taking \nYargesa (see section  4). Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. \n \nTo remove the capsule: \n \n1. Separate at perforations \n \n2. Peel back paper at arrows \n \n3 Push product through foil \n \n \nYargesa can be taken with or without food. You should swallow the whole capsule with a glass of water. \n \nIf you take more Yargesa than you should \nIf you take more capsules than you were told to, consult your doctor immediately. Miglustat has been used in \nclinical trials at doses ten times higher than the recommended dose: this caused decreases in white blood \ncells and other side effects similar to those described in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take Yargesa \nTake the next capsule at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Yargesa \nDo not stop taking Yargesa without talking to your doctor. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost serious side effects \nSome patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (seen commonly). They could be \nsigns of peripheral neuropathy, due to side effects of Yargesa or they could be due to existing conditions. \nYour doctor will perform some tests before and during treatment with Yargesa to assess this (see section 2). \n \nIf you do get any of these effects, please seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you get a slight tremor, usually trembling hands, seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as \npossible. The tremor often disappears without needing to stop the treatment. Sometimes your doctor will \nneed to reduce the dose or stop Yargesa treatment to stop the tremor. \n \nVery common effects – may affect more than 1 in 10 people \nThe most common side effects are diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), abdominal (stomach) pain, weight loss and \ndecreased appetite. \n \nIf you do lose some weight when you start treatment with Yargesa don’t worry. People usually stop losing \nweight as treatment goes on. \n \nCommon effects – may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n\n\n23 \n\nCommon side effects of treatment include headache, dizziness, paraesthesia (tingling or numbness), \nabnormal coordination, hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation to touch), dyspepsia (heartburn), nausea (feeling \nsick), constipation and vomiting, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (stomach) and thrombocytopenia \n(reduced levels of blood platelets).The neurological symptoms and thrombocytopenia could be due to the \nunderlying disease. \n \nOther possible side effects are muscular spasms or weakness, fatigue, chills and malaise, depression, \ndifficulty sleeping, forgetfulness and reduced libido. \n \nMost patients get one or more of these side effects, usually at the start of treatment or at intervals during \ntreatment. Most cases are mild and disappear quite quickly. If any of these side effects cause problems, \nconsult your doctor. He or she may reduce the dose of Yargesa or recommend other medicines to help \ncontrol side effects. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Yargesa \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not take this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister and carton after ‘EXP’. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw \naway medicines you no longer take. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
