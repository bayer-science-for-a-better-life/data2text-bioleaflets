PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite to almost white lyophilised powder.  \nThe pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. \nThe Osmolality of the reconstituted solution is 230-270 mOsmol/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \nCIAMBRA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naive patients \nwith unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nCIAMBRA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(see section 5.1). \n \nCIAMBRA is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or \nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients \nwhose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nCIAMBRA is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology (see section \n5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCIAMBRA must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of  \nanti-cancer chemotherapy. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nPosology \n \nCIAMBRA in combination with cisplatin \nThe recommended dose of CIAMBRA is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of \ncisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the \npemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients must receive adequate anti-emetic \ntreatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin \nSummary of Product Characteristics for specific dosing advice). \n \nCIAMBRA as single agent \nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of \nCIAMBRA is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first \nday of each 21-day cycle. \n \nPre-medication regimen \nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior to, \non the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent to \n4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n \nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see \nsection 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to \n1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days \npreceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of therapy and \nfor 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of \nvitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every \nthree cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as \npemetrexed. \n \nMonitoring \nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, \nincluding a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy \nadministration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before \nthe start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute neutrophil \ncount (ANC) should be \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3. \nCreatinine clearance should be \u2265 45 ml/min. \nThe total bilirubin should be \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) should be \u2264 3 times \nupper limit of normal. AP, AST and ALT \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has \ntumour involvement. \n \nDose adjustments \nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or \nmaximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to \nallow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines in \nTables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for CIAMBRA used as a single agent or in combination with \ncisplatin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nTable 1 - Dose modification table for CIAMBRA (as single agent or in combination) and \ncisplatin \u2013 Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir  platelets \n\u2265 50,000 /mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets <50,000 /mm3 regardless of \nnadir ANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets <50,000/mm3 with bleedinga, \nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50% of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI \n1998) definition of \u2265CTC Grade 2 bleeding \n \nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities \u2265 Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), CIAMBRA \nshould be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient\u2019s pre-therapy value.

Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. \n \n\nTable 3 - Dose modification table for CIAMBRA (as single agent or in combination) \nand cisplatin \u2013 Neurotoxicity \n\nCTC a Grade Dose of CIAMBRA (mg/m2) Dose for cisplatin (mg/m2) \n\n0 \u2013 1 100 % of previous dose 100 % of previous dose \n\n2 100 % of previous dose 50 % of previous dose \n\na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n \nTreatment with CIAMBRA should be discontinued if a patient experiences any haematologic or  \nnon-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 \nneurotoxicity is observed. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nSpecial Population \n \nElderly \nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased \nrisk of adverse reactions compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions other than \nthose recommended for all patients are necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of CIAMBRA in the paediatric population in malignant pleural mesothelioma \nand non-small cell lung cancer. \n \nPatients with renal impairment (Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate \nmeasured Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method) \nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with \ncreatinine clearance of \u2265 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for all \npatients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended  (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin > 1.5 \ntimes the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic \nmetastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been \nspecifically studied. \n \nMethod of administration  \nCIAMBRA is for intravenous use. CIAMBRA should be administered as an intravenous infusion over \n10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering CIAMBRA, see section 6.6. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of CIAMBRA before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. \nPatients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be \ngiven to patients until ANC returns to \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to \u2265 100,000 \ncells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and \nmaximum  non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n \nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when  \npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated with \npemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce \ntreatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with \ndexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. \nTherefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should \navoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic \nacid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed \nadministration (see section 4.5). \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with \nlong elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 \ndays following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n \nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in \nassociation with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had \nunderlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing \nhypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis were also reported \nin post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Most of these \nevents resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients should be regularly monitored for acute tubular \nnecrosis, decreased renal function and signs and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. \nhypernatraemia). \n \nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. A \nphase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid demonstrated no \ndifference in pemetrexed dose normalised plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients \nwithout third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed \ntreatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. \n \nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and \nappropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n \nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been \nuncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination with \nanother cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had \npre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated \nvaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men \nare advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed \n(see section 4.6). \n \nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, during \nor subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients and \ncaution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. \n \nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years \npreviously. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by \nglomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal products  (e.g. \naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed \nclearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine \nclearance should be closely monitored. \n \nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) \ncould potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these \nmedicinal products are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), high doses of NSAIDs (such \nas ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid  at higher dose (> 1.3 g daily) may decrease \npemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse reactions. \nTherefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, \nconcurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the \nconcomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed \nadministration (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such as \npiroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least \n2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant administration of \nNSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression \nand gastrointestinal toxicity. \n \nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition \nof the metabolic clearance of medicines metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2. \n \nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is \nfrequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased \nfrequency of International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with \noral anticoagulants. \nConcomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see \nsection 4.3). \nConcomitant use not recommended: Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which \nconcomitant use is contraindicated): risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in \nsubjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine \nwhere it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and \nthe risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the  \nbreast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to \nseek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPemetrexed may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Fatigue may occur \nfollowing administration of Pemetrexed (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy \nor in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other undesirable effects include renal toxicities, \nincreased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. \nRarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table 4 lists the adverse drug events regardless of causality associated with pemetrexed used either \nas a monotherapy treatment or in combination with cisplatin from the pivotal registration studies \n(JMCH, JMEI, JMBD, JMEN and PARAMOUNT) and from the post marketing period. \n \nADRs are listed by MedDRA body system organ class. The following convention has been used for \nclassification of frequency: \n \nvery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1000 to \n<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from \navailable data). \n \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nTable 4.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, sensory \npolyneuropathy and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as \nmanifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, \ndiarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be \nmonitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium \nfolinate /folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed overdose should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 \n \nCIAMBRA (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by \ndisrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of \nthymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate \ncarrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly \nand efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The \npolyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. \nPolyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a \nlesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life \nresulting in prolonged active substance action in malignant cells. \n \nClinical efficacy \nMesothelioma \nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus \ncisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated \nwith pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over \npatients receiving cisplatin alone. \n \nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patients\u2019 \ntherapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all \npatients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received the medicinal product (randomised and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n \n\ntreated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B12 \nsupplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented).

The separation \nbetween the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the pemetrexed /cisplatin \narm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n \nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed alone. \nPemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive patients with \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n \nNSCLC, second-line treatment: \nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of \n8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (intent to treat population (ITT) n = 283) and 7.9 \nmonths for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy did not include \npemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival \nwas in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n = \n399, 9.3 versus \n8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0 .61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for \nsquamous cell carcinoma histology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; \n95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety \nprofile of pemetrexed within the histology subgroups. \n \nLimited clinical data from a separate randomised, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data \n(overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously \npre treated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n(n = 540). \n \n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed vs docetaxel in NSCLC - ITT population \n Pemetrexed Docetaxel \n\nSurvival time (months) \n\uf0a7  Median (m) \n\uf0a7  95 % CI for median \n\uf0a7  HR \n\uf0a7  95 % CI for HR \n\uf0a7  Non-inferiority p-value (HR) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n8.3 7.9       \n\n(7.0 - 9.4) (6.3 - 9.2) \n0.99        \n\n(0.82 - 1.20) \n  0.226 \n\nProgression free survival (months) \n\uf0a7  Median \n\uf0a7  HR (95 % CI) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n2.9  2.9 \n\n0.97 (0.82 \u2013 1.16) \nTime to treatment failure (TTTF \u2013 months) \n\n\uf0a7  Median \n\uf0a7  HR (95 % CI) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n2.3 2.1 \n\n0.84 (0.71 - 0.997) \nResponse (n: qualified for response) \n\n\uf0a7  Response rate (%) (95 % CI) \n\uf0a7  Stable disease (%) \n\n(n = 264) \n9.1 (5.9 - 13.2) \n\n45.8 \n\n(n = 274) \n8.8 (5.7 - 12.8) \n\n46.4 \nAbbreviations:  CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; n = total population \nsize. \n \nNSCLC, first-line treatment: \nA multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine \nplus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC \nshowed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin (ITT population \nn = 862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical efficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin \n(ITT n = 863) in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients \nincluded in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. \nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy \nendpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using \nPQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of \nAC versus GC. \nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% \n(95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) for \ngemcitabine plus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review (400/1725 \npatients were randomly selected for review). \nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant \ndifferences in survival according to histology, see table below. \n\n \n \n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin vs. gemcitabine + cisplatin in first-line non-small cell lung \ncancer \u2013 ITT population and histology subgroups. \n\n \n \nITT population \nand histology \nsubgroups \n\nMedian overall survival in months \n(95% CI) \n\nAdjusted \nhazard \n\nratio (HR) \n(95% CI) \n\n \nSuperiority \n\np-value  \nPemetrexed + cisplatin \n\nGemcitabine + \ncisplatin \n\nITT population \n(N = 1725) \n\n10.3 \n(9.8 \u2013 11.2) \n\nN=862 10.3 \n(9.6 \u2013 10.9) \n\nN=863 0.94a \n(0.84 \u2013 1.05) \n\n0.259 \n\nAdenocarcinoma \n(N=847) \n\n12.6 \n(10.7 \u2013 13.6) \n\nN=436 10.9 \n(10.2 \u2013 11.9) \n\nN=411 0.84 \n(0.71\u20130.99) \n\n0.033 \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nLarge cell \n(N=153) \n\n10.4 \n(8.6 \u2013 14.1) \n\nN=76 6.7 \n(5.5 \u2013 9.0) \n\nN=77 0.67 \n(0.48\u20130.96) \n\n0.027 \n\nOther \n(N=252) \n\n8.6 \n(6.8 \u2013 10.2) \n\nN=106 9.2 \n(8.1 \u2013 10.6) \n\nN=146 1.08 \n(0.81\u20131.45) \n\n0.586 \n\nSquamous cell \n(N=473) \n\n9.4 \n(8.4 \u2013 10.2) \n\nN=244 10.8 \n(9.5 \u2013 12.1) \n\nN=229 1.23 \n(1.00\u20131.51) \n\n0.050 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; N = total population size. \na Statistically significant for noninferiority, with the entire confidence interval for HR well below the \n1.17645 noninferiority margin (p <0.001). \n \n \n \n \n \nKaplan Meier plots of overall survival by histology \n \n\n \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed plus \ncisplatin within the histology subgroups. \nPatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus 28.9%, \np<0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p<0.001) and platelet transfusions (1.8% \nversus 4.5%, p=0.002).

First line \ndoublet therapy containing pemetrexed was not included. All patients included in this study had an \nECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. \nEfficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line \n(induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed \nand 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed \u2265 6 cycles and a total of 103 \npatients (23.4%) completed \u2265 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. The \nmedian OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.6 \nmonths for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01192). \n \nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was \nobserved in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The median \nOS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was \n15.5 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% CI \n= 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other \nthan predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n13.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). \n \nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for \npemetrexed over placebo. \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed within the \nhistology subgroups. \n \nJMEN: Kaplan Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival pemetrexed  \nversus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology: \n \n\n \n \nPARAMOUNT \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (PARAMOUNT), \ncompared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus BSC (n \n= 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or \nmetastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress \nafter 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 \npatients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to maintenance \ntreatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a complete/partial \nresponse and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction. Patients \nrandomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The \nmedian time from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance \ntreatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients \nreceived maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the \ntime of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 4 \ncycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 4 cycles of placebo. A total of 169 patients \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n(47.1%) completed \u2265 6 cycles maintenance treatment with pemetrexed, representing at least 10 total \ncycles of pemetrexed. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median of 3.9 \nmonths and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = 0.0002). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For \nrandomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction \ntreatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the pemetrexed arm and 5.6 \nmonths for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = 0.47-0.74). \n \nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was statistically \nsuperior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 95%CI = \n0.64-0.96, p = 0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of patients were alive or lost \nto follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm. The relative treatment effect of \npemetrexed was internally consistent across subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, \nECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the unadjusted \nOS and PFS analyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 58% and \n32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo. From the start of pemetrexed \nplus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for the \npemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96). The \npercentage of patients that received post study treatment was 64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% for \nplacebo. \n \nPARAMOUNT: Kaplan Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) \nfor continuation pemetrexed maintenance versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than \npredominantly squamous cell histology (measured from randomisation) \n \n\n \nThe pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were \nsimilar. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population in the \ngranted indications (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been \nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to \n838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n9 l/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. \nBinding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes \nlimited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the \nadministered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \nadministration. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 (organic anion \ntransporter. Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from \nplasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). \nBetween patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure \n(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics \nof pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered \ncisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the \npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal \nweight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced \nfertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous bolus injection \nfor 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been \nobserved. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not \ninvestigated. \nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster \novary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus \ntest in the mouse. \n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n6.

The reconstituted solution should be used immediately to prepare the \ninfusion solution. From a microbiological point of view, the infusion solution should be used \nimmediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C.  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution/dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nType I glass vial with chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with flip off cap. The vial is  \ncovered with a shrink-wrapped plastic sleeve. Each 10 ml vial contains 100 mg of pemetrexed (as \npemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate).   \n \nPack of 1 vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n2. Calculate the dose and the number of CIAMBRA vials needed. Each vial contains an excess of \n\npemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount. \n \n3. Reconstitute 100 mg vials with 4.2 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \n\ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. Gently \nswirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and \nranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product \nquality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is \nrequired. \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml \n\nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, without preservative, and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. \n\n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl chloride \n\nand polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. \n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter or discolouration is observed, do not \nadminister. \n\n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material \n\nmust be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \nPreparation and administration precautions  \nAs with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed \nsolution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If \npemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not \na vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. \nExtravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n7.

Patients must receive adequate anti-emetic \ntreatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also cisplatin \nSummary of Product Characteristics for specific dosing advice). \n \nCIAMBRA as single agent \nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of \nCIAMBRA is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first \nday of each 21-day cycle. \n \nPre-medication regimen \nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior to, \non the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent to \n4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4). \n \nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see \nsection 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to \n1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days \npreceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of therapy and \nfor 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of \nvitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every \nthree cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as \npemetrexed. \n \nMonitoring \nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, \nincluding a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy \nadministration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before \nthe start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute neutrophil \ncount (ANC) should be \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be \u2265 100,000 cells/mm3. \nCreatinine clearance should be \u2265 45 ml/min. \nThe total bilirubin should be \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) should be \u2264 3 times \nupper limit of normal. AP, AST and ALT \u2264 5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has \ntumour involvement. \n \nDose adjustments \nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or \nmaximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed \nto allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines \nin Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for CIAMBRA used as a single agent or in combination \nwith cisplatin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nTable 1 - Dose modification table for CIAMBRA (as single agent or in combination) and \ncisplatin \u2013 Haematologic toxicities \n\nNadir ANC < 500 /mm3 and nadir  platelets \n\u2265 50,000 /mm3 \n\n75 % of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets <50,000 /mm3 regardless of \nnadir ANC \n\n75 % of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets <50,000/mm3 with bleedinga, \nregardless of nadir ANC \n\n50% of previous dose (both CIAMBRA \nand cisplatin) \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI \n1998) definition of \u2265CTC Grade 2 bleeding \n \nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities \u2265 Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), CIAMBRA should \nbe withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient\u2019s pre-therapy value.

No dose reductions other \nthan those recommended for all patients are necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of CIAMBRA in the paediatric population in malignant pleural mesothelioma \nand non-small cell lung cancer. \n \nPatients with renal impairment (Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate \nmeasured Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method) \nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with \ncreatinine clearance of \u2265 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for all \npatients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n No relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \npharmacokinetics were identified. However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin > 1.5 \ntimes the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic \nmetastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been \nspecifically studied. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nCIAMBRA is for intravenous use. CIAMBRA should be administered as an intravenous infusion over \n10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering CIAMBRA, see section 6.6. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of CIAMBRA before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. \nPatients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be \ngiven to patients until ANC returns to \u2265 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to \u2265 100,000 \ncells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and \nmaximum  non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2). \n \nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when  \npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated with \npemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce \ntreatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with \ndexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. \nTherefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should \navoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic \nacid (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration \n(see section 4.5). \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with \nlong elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 \ndays following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5). \n \nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in \nassociation with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had \nunderlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing \nhypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis were also reported \nin post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Most of these \nevents resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients should be regularly monitored for acute tubular \nnecrosis, decreased renal function and signs and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. \nhypernatraemia). \n \nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. A \nphase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid demonstrated no \ndifference in pemetrexed dose normalised plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients \nwithout third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed \ntreatment should be considered, but may not be necessary. \n \nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and \nappropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment. \n \nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been \nuncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination with \nanother cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had  \npre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8). \n \nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated \nvaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men \nare advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed \n(see section 4.6). \n \nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, during \nor subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients and \ncaution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents. \n \nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years \npreviously. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 54 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 2,7% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by \nglomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal products (e.g. \naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed \nclearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine \nclearance should be closely monitored. \n \nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g. probenecid, penicillin) \ncould potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these \nmedicinal products  are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), high doses of NSAIDs (such \nas ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid at higher dose (> 1.3 g daily) may decrease \npemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse reactions. \nTherefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, \nconcurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the \nconcomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher dose should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed \nadministration (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such as \npiroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least \n2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant administration of \nNSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression \nand gastrointestinal toxicity. \n \nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition \nof the metabolic clearance of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and \nCYP1A2. \n \nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is \nfrequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased \nfrequency of International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with \noral anticoagulants. \nConcomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see \nsection 4.3). \nConcomitant use not recommended: Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which \nconcomitant use is contraindicated): risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in \nsubjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine \nwhere it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. \n \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other \nanti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and \nthe risk for the foetus (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the  \nbreast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \ntherapy (see section 4.3). \n \n \nFertility \nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to \nseek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPemetrexed may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Fatigue may occur \nfollowing administration of Pemetrexed (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy \nor in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other undesirable effects include renal toxicities, \nincreased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. \nRarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table 4 lists the adverse drug events regardless of causality associated with pemetrexed used either \nas a monotherapy treatment or in combination with cisplatin from the pivotal registration studies \n(JMCH, JMEI, JMBD, JMEN and PARAMOUNT) and from the post marketing period. \n \nADRs are listed by MedDRA body system organ class. The following convention has been used for \nclassification of frequency: \n \n very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1000 to<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto<1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nTable 4.

Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as \nmanifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, \ndiarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be \nmonitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium \nfolinate / folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed overdose should be considered. \n \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agent, folic acid analogues, ATC code: L01BA04 \n \nCIAMBRA (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by \ndisrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting \nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of \nthymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate \ncarrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly \nand efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The \npolyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. \nPolyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a \nlesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life \nresulting in prolonged active substance action in malignant cells. \n \nClinical efficacy \nMesothelioma \nEMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus \ncisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated \nwith pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over \npatients receiving cisplatin alone. \n \nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patients\u2019 \ntherapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n \n\npatients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received the medicinal products (randomised and \ntreated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B12 \nsupplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented).

The separation \nbetween the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the pemetrexed /cisplatin \narm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm. \n \nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed alone. \nPemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemonaive patients with \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1 %. \n \nNSCLC, second-line treatment: \nA multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of \n8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (intent to treat population (ITT) n = 283) and 7.9 \nmonths for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288). Prior chemotherapy did not include \npemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival \nwas in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n = \n399, 9.3 versus \n8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0 .61-1.00, p = 0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for \nsquamous cell carcinoma histology (n = 172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; \n95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety \nprofile of pemetrexed within the histology subgroups. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nLimited clinical data from a separate randomised, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data \n(overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously \npre treated with docetaxel (n = 41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment  \n(n = 540). \n \n \n\nEfficacy of pemetrexed vs docetaxel in NSCLC - ITT population \n Pemetrexed Docetaxel \n\nSurvival time (months) \n\uf0a7  Median (m) \n\uf0a7  95 % CI for median \n\uf0a7  HR \n\uf0a7  95 % CI for HR \n\uf0a7  Non-inferiority p-value (HR) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n8.3 7.9       \n\n(7.0 - 9.4) (6.3 - 9.2) \n0.99        \n\n(0.82 - 1.20) \n0.226 \n\nProgression free survival (months) \n\uf0a7  Median \n\uf0a7  HR (95 % CI) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n2.9 2.9 \n\n0.97 (0.82 \u2013 1.16) \nTime to treatment failure (TTTF \u2013 months) \n\n\uf0a7  Median \n\uf0a7  HR (95 % CI) \n\n(n = 283) (n = 288) \n2.3 2.1 \n\n0.84 (0.71 - 0.997) \nResponse (n: qualified for response) \n\n\uf0a7  Response rate (%) (95 % CI) \n\uf0a7  Stable disease (%) \n\n(n = 264) \n9.1 (5.9 - 13.2) \n\n45.8 \n\n(n = 274) \n8.8 (5.7 - 12.8) \n\n46.4 \nAbbreviations:  CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; n = total population \nsize. \n \nNSCLC, first-line treatment: \nA multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine \nplus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC \nshowed that pemetrexed plus cisplatin (ITT population \nn = 862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical efficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin \n(ITT n = 863) in overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94; 95% CI = 0.84-1.05). All patients \nincluded in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. \nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy \nendpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using \nPQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of \nAC versus GC. \nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% \n(95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0-31.4) for \ngemcitabine plus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review (400/1725 \npatients were randomly selected for review). \nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant \ndifferences in survival according to histology, see table below. \n \n\n \nEfficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin vs. gemcitabine + cisplatin in first-line non-small cell lung \n\ncancer \u2013 ITT population and histology subgroups. \n \nITT population \nand histology \nsubgroups \n\nMedian overall survival in months \n(95% CI) \n\nAdjusted \nhazard \n\nratio (HR) \n(95% CI) \n\n \nSuperiority \n\np-value  \nPemetrexed + cisplatin \n\nGemcitabine + \ncisplatin \n\nITT population \n(N = 1725) \n\n10.3 \n(9.8 \u2013 11.2) \n\nN=862 10.3 \n(9.6 \u2013 10.9) \n\nN=863 0.94a \n(0.84 \u2013 1.05) \n\n0.259 \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nAdenocarcinoma \n(N=847) \n\n12.6 \n(10.7 \u2013 13.6) \n\nN=436 10.9 \n(10.2 \u2013 11.9) \n\nN=411 0.84 \n(0.71\u20130.99) \n\n0.033 \n\nLarge cell \n(N=153) \n\n10.4 \n(8.6 \u2013 14.1) \n\nN=76 6.7 \n(5.5 \u2013 9.0) \n\nN=77 0.67 \n(0.48\u20130.96) \n\n0.027 \n\nOther \n(N=252) \n\n8.6 \n(6.8 \u2013 10.2) \n\nN=106 9.2 \n(8.1 \u2013 10.6) \n\nN=146 1.08 \n(0.81\u20131.45) \n\n0.586 \n\nSquamous cell \n(N=473) \n\n9.4 \n(8.4 \u2013 10.2) \n\nN=244 10.8 \n(9.5 \u2013 12.1) \n\nN=229 1.23 \n(1.00\u20131.51) \n\n0.050 \n\nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; N = total population size. \na Statistically significant for noninferiority, with the entire confidence interval for HR well below the \n1.17645 noninferiority margin (p <0.001). \n \nKaplan Meier plots of overall survival by histology \n\n \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed plus \ncisplatin within the histology subgroups. \nPatients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% versus 28.9%, \np<0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% versus 27.3%, p<0.001) and platelet transfusions (1.8% \nversus 4.5%, p=0.002). Patients also required lower administration of erythropoietin/darbopoietin \n(10.4% versus 18.1%, p<0.001), G-CSF/GM-CSF (3.1% versus 6.1%, p=0.004), and iron preparations \n(4.3% versus 7.0%, p=0.021). \n \nNSCLC, maintenance treatment: \nJMEN \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (JMEN), compared the \nefficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = \n441) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 222) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or \nmetastatic (Stage IV) (NSCLC) who did not progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy \ncontaining cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. First line \ndoublet therapy containing pemetrexed was not included. All patients included in this study had an \nECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. \nEfficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first line \n(induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed \nand 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed \u2265 6 cycles and a total of 103 \npatients (23.4%) completed \u2265 10 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of \n4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. The \nmedian OS for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.6 \nmonths for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI = 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01192). \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was \nobserved in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(n = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The median \nOS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was \n15.5 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% CI \n= 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other \nthan predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n13.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). \n \nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for \npemetrexed over placebo. \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed within the \nhistology subgroups. \n \nJMEN: Kaplan Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival pemetrexed \nversus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology: \n \n\n \n \nPARAMOUNT \nA multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (PARAMOUNT), \ncompared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus BSC (n \n= 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n = 180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or \nmetastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress \nafter 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 \npatients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to maintenance \ntreatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a complete/partial \nresponse and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction. Patients \nrandomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The \nmedian time from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance \ntreatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomised patients \nreceived maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the \ntime of randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of  4 \ncycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 4 cycles of placebo. A total of 169 patients \n(47.1%) completed \u2265 6 cycles maintenance treatment with pemetrexed, representing at least 10 total \ncycles of pemetrexed. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (n = 472, independently reviewed population; median of 3.9 \nmonths and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = 0.0002). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For \nrandomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first line induction \ntreatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the pemetrexed arm and 5.6 \nmonths for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59 95% CI = 0.47-0.74). \n \nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was statistically \nsuperior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 95 % CI \n= 0.64-0.96, p = 0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of patients were alive or lost \nto follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm. The relative treatment effect of \npemetrexed was internally consistent across subgroups (including disease stage, induction response, \nECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the unadjusted \nOS and PFS analyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were 58% and \n32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo. From the start of pemetrexed \nplus cisplatin first line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for the \npemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96). The \npercentage of patients that received post study treatment was 64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% for \nplacebo. \n \nPARAMOUNT: Kaplan Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) \nfor continuation pemetrexed maintenance versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than \npredominantly squamous cell histology (measured from randomisation) \n\n \n \nThe pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were \nsimilar. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe granted indications (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been \nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to \n838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of9 \nl/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81 % bound to plasma proteins. \nBinding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes \nlimited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the \nadministered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nadministration. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 (organic anion \ntransporter. Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from \nplasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). \nBetween patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3 %. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure \n(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics \nof pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered \ncisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the \npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal \nweight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced \nfertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous bolus injection \nfor 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been \nobserved. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not \ninvestigated. \nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster \novary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus \ntest in the mouse. \n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E 421) \nHydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer\u2019s \ninjection and Ringer\u2019s injection This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years \n \nReconstituted and infusion solutions \nChemical and physical in-use stability of the infusion solution of pemetrexed was demonstrated for 24 \nhours at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C or at 15\u00b0C-25\u00b0C. The reconstituted solution should be used immediately to prepare \nthe infusion solution.  \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nshould not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or at 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C.  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution/dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nType I glass vial with chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with flip off cap. The vial is \ncovered with a shrink-wrapped plastic sleeve . Each 50 ml vial contains 500 mg of pemetrexed (as \npemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate). \n \nPack of 1 vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for \n\nintravenous infusion administration. \n \n2. Calculate the dose and the number of CIAMBRA vials needed. Each vial contains an excess of \n\npemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount. \n \n3. Reconstitute 500 mg vials with 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, \n\nwithout preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. Gently swirl each \nvial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in colour \nfrom colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. The pH \nof the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is required. \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml \n\nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, without preservative, and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. \n\n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl chloride \n\nand polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. \n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter or discolouration is observed, do not \nadminister. \n\n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material \n\nmust be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nPreparation and administration precautions  \nAs with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed \nsolution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If \npemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not \na vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. \nExtravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your  doctor or pharmacist \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you use CIAMBRA  \n3. How to use CIAMBRA  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store CIAMBRA  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What CIAMBRA is and what it is used for \n \nCIAMBRA is a medicine used in the treatment of cancer. \n \nCIAMBRA is given in combination with cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine, as treatment for \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma, a form of cancer that affects the lining of the lung, to patients who \nhave not received prior chemotherapy. \n \nCIAMBRA is also given in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with \nadvanced stage of lung cancer. \n \nCIAMBRA can be prescribed to you if you have lung cancer at an advanced stage if your disease has \nresponded to treatment or it remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy. \n \nCIAMBRA is also a treatment for patients with advanced stage of lung cancer whose disease has \nprogressed after other initial chemotherapy has been used. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use CIAMBRA \n \nDo not use CIAMBRA \n \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of CIAMBRA \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with \n\nCIAMBRA. \n- if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever. \n \n \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving CIAMBRA. \nIf you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or \nhospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive CIAMBRA. \nBefore each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient \nkidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive CIAMBRA. Your \ndoctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if \nyour blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that \nyou are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to \nprevent vomiting. \n \nIf you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early \nor late radiation reaction with CIAMBRA. \n \nIf you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects \nwith CIAMBRA. \n \nIf you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. \n \nIf you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid \nbefore giving you CIAMBRA. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nCIAMBRA is not to be given to children and adolescents because no studies were performed in these \ngroups. \n \nOther medicines and CIAMBRA \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as \nmedicines called \u201cnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u201d (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased \nwithout a doctor\u2019s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different \ndurations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of CIAMBRA and/or on the status of \nyour kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you \ncan take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The \nuse of CIAMBRA should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the \npotential risk of taking CIAMBRA during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception during \ntreatment with CIAMBRA. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. \nBreast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with CIAMBRA. \n \nFertility \n \nMen are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months following treatment with CIAMBRA \nand should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with CIAMBRA and for up to 6 \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nmonths afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 6 months \nfollowing receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. You may want to seek \ncounselling on sperm storage before starting your therapy.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nCIAMBRA may make you feel tired. Be careful when driving a car or using machines. \n \nCIAMBRA contains sodium \n \nCIAMBRA 100 mg contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nCIAMBRA 500 mg contains 54 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This \nis equivalent to 2,7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n3. How to use CIAMBRA \n \nThe dose of CIAMBRA is 500 mg for every square metre of your body\u2019s surface area. Your height \nand weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will use this body \nsurface area to work out the right dose for you. This dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be \ndelayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital pharmacist, \nnurse or doctor will have mixed the CIAMBRA powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride \nsolution for injection before it is given to you. \n \nYou will always receive CIAMBRA by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last \napproximately 10 minutes. \n \nWhen using CIAMBRA in combination with cisplatin: \nThe doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. \nCisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after \nthe infusion of CIAMBRA has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. \n \nYou should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. \n \nAdditional medicines: \nCorticosteroids: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone \ntwice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day after CIAMBRA \ntreatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions that \nyou may experience during your anticancer treatment. \n \nVitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin \ncontaining folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking \nCIAMBRA. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of CIAMBRA. \nYou must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of CIAMBRA. You will also \nreceive an injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of \nCIAMBRA and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of CIAMBRA \ntreatment). Vitamin B12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the \nanticancer treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Each vial contains an excess of \npemetrexed to facilitate delivery of the label amount. \n \n3. CIAMBRA 100 mg: \nReconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n \nCIAMBRA 500 mg: \nReconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n \nGently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear \nand ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting \nproduct quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is \nrequired. \n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml \nwith 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection, without preservative, and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. \n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl \nchloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. Pemetrexed is incompatible \nwith diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection and Ringer\u2019s Injection. \n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. \n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused product or waste material should be \ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nPreparation and administration precautions: As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, \ncare should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of \ngloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush \nthoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not a vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation \nof pemetrexed. There have been a few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not \nassessed as serious by the investigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as \nwith other non-vesicants. \n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

receive a vaccine against yellow fever. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving ciambra. if you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive ciambra. before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive ciambra. your doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if your blood cell counts are too low. if you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to prevent vomiting. if you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early or late radiation reaction with ciambra. if you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects with ciambra. if you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. if you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid before giving you ciambra. children and adolescents ciambra is not to be given to children and adolescents because no studies were performed in these groups. other medicines and ciambra please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as medicines called \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\" (nsaids), including medicines purchased without a doctor's prescription (such as ibuprofen). there are many sorts of nsaids with different durations of activity. based on the planned date of your infusion of ciambra and/or on the status of your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you can take them. if you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are nsaids. please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. pregnancy if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. the use of ciambra should be avoided during pregnancy. your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of taking ciambra during pregnancy. women must use effective contraception during treatment with ciambra. breast-feeding if you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with ciambra. fertility men are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months following treatment with ciambra and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with ciambra and for up to 6 51 months afterwards. if you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 6 months following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. you may want to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting your therapy. driving and using machines ciambra may make you feel tired. be careful when driving a car or using machines. ciambra contains sodium ciambra 100 mg contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. ciambra 500 mg contains 54 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. this is equivalent to 2,7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.", "Entity_Recognition":

height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. your doctor will use this body surface area to work out the right dose for you. this dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. a hospital pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have mixed the ciambra powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution for injection before it is given to you. you will always receive ciambra by infusion into one of your veins. the infusion will last approximately 10 minutes. when using ciambra in combination with cisplatin: the doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after the infusion of ciambra has finished. the infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. you should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. additional medicines: corticosteroids: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day after ciambra treatment. this medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. vitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking ciambra. you must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of ciambra. you must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of ciambra. you will also receive an injection of vitamin b12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of ciambra and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of ciambra treatment). vitamin b12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the anticancer treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ciambra",
