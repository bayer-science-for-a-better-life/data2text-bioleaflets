PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nCapecitabine SUN 150 mg film-coated tablets are light peach coloured, oval, biconvex, 11.5 mm x \n5.7 mm tablets with inscription ‘150’on one side and plain on other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCapecitabine is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients following surgery of stage III (Dukes’ \nstage C) colon cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nCapecitabine is indicated for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nCapecitabine is indicated for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer in combination with a \nplatinum-based regimen (see section 5.1). \n \nCapecitabine in combination with docetaxel (see section 5.1) is indicated for the treatment of patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. Capecitabine is also indicated as monotherapy for the \ntreatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of taxanes and an \nanthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or for whom further anthracycline therapy is not \nindicated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the utilisation of \nanti-neoplastic medicinal products. Careful monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is \nrecommended for all patients.  \nTreatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable toxicity is observed. Standard \nand reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for starting doses of capecitabine of \n1250 mg/m2 and 1000 mg/m2 are provided in tables 1 and 2, respectively. \n \nPosology \n \nRecommended posology (see section 5.1): \n \nMonotherapy \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nColon, colorectal and breast cancer \nGiven as monotherapy, the recommended starting dose for capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of \ncolon cancer, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or of locally advanced or metastatic \nbreast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 administered twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to \n2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Adjuvant treatment in \npatients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months. \n \nCombination therapy \nColon, colorectal and gastric cancer \nIn combination treatment, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine should be reduced to \n800 - 1000 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, or to \n625 mg/m2 twice daily when administered continuously (see section 5.1). For combination with \nirinotecan, the recommended starting dose is 800 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1. The inclusion of \nbevacizumab in a combination regimen has no effect on the starting dose of capecitabine. \nPremedication to maintain adequate hydration and anti-emesis according to the cisplatin summary of \nproduct characteristics should be started prior to cisplatin administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus cisplatin combination. Premedication with antiemetics according to the oxaliplatin \nsummary of product characteristics is recommended for patients receiving the capecitabine plus \noxaliplatin combination. Adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended \nfor a duration of 6 months. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn combination with docetaxel, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine in the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, \ncombined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Pre-medication \nwith an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone according to the docetaxel summary of product \ncharacteristics should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel combination. \n \nCapecitabine dose calculations \n \nTable 1 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose \n\nof capecitabine of 1250 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1250 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n\n \n Full dose  \n\n1250 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg \ntablets and/or  \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \nadministration to be \ngiven morning and \n\nevening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n950 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n625 mg/m2 \n\nBody Surface \nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\n \n150 mg \n\n \n\n \n500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n≤1.26 1500 - 3 1150 800 \n1.27 - 1.38 1650 1 3 1300 800 \n1.39 - 1.52 1800 2 3 1450 950 \n1.53 - 1.66 2000 - 4 1500 1000 \n1.67 - 1.78 2150 1 4 1650 1000 \n1.79 - 1.92 2300 2 4 1800 1150 \n1.93 - 2.06 2500 - 5 1950 1300 \n2.07 - 2.18 2650 1 5 2000 1300 \n≥2.19 2800 2 5 2150 1450 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \nTable 2 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose \n\nof capecitabine of 1000 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1000 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n\n \n Full dose  \n\n \n \n\n1000 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg \ntablets and/or \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \nadministration to be \ngiven morning and \n\nevening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n750 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n500 mg/m2 \n\nBody Surface \nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\n \n150 mg \n\n \n500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n≤1.26 1150 1 2 800 600 \n1.27 - 1.38 1300 2 2 1000 600 \n1.39 - 1.52 1450 3 2 1100 750 \n1.53 - 1.66 1600 4 2 1200 800 \n1.67 - 1.78 1750 5 2 1300 800 \n1.79 - 1.92 1800 2 3 1400 900 \n1.93 - 2.06 2000 - 4 1500 1000 \n2.07 - 2.18 2150 1 4 1600 1050 \n≥2.19 2300 2 4 1750 1100 \n \nPosology adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nToxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment and/or \nmodification of the dose (treatment interruption or dose reduction).

For those toxicities considered by the treating physician to be \nunlikely to become serious or life-threatening, e.g. alopecia, altered taste, nail changes, treatment can \nbe continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. Patients taking capecitabine should be \ninformed of the need to interrupt treatment immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs. Doses \nof capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced.

If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a \ntreatment cycle show that the neutrophil count drops below 1.0 x 109/L or that the platelet count drops \nbelow 75 x 109/L, treatment with capecitabine should be interrupted. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to \nthe appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nAt the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine or the \nother medicinal product(s), then administration of all therapy should be delayed until the requirements \nfor restarting all medicinal products are met. \n \nDuring a treatment cycle for those toxicities considered by the treating physician not to be related to \ncapecitabine, capecitabine should be continued and the dose of the other medicinal product should be \nadjusted according to the appropriate Prescribing Information. \n \nIf the other medicinal product(s) have to be discontinued permanently, capecitabine treatment can be \nresumed when the requirements for restarting capecitabine are met. \n \nThis advice is applicable to all indications and to all special populations. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products  \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to the \nappropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nPosology adjustments for special populations \n \nHepatic impairment  \nInsufficient safety and efficacy data are available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose \nadjustment recommendation. No information is available on hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis or \nhepatitis. \n \nRenal impairment  \nCapecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below \n30 ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] at baseline). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min at baseline) is increased \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\ncompared to the overall population. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, a dose \nreduction to 75% for a starting dose of 1250 mg/m2 is recommended. In patients with moderate renal \nimpairment at baseline, no dose reduction is required for a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2. In patients \nwith mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51-80 ml/min at baseline) no adjustment of the \nstarting dose is recommended. Careful monitoring and prompt treatment interruption is recommended \nif the patient develops a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse event during treatment and subsequent dose \nadjustment as outlined in table 3 above. If the calculated creatinine clearance decreases during \ntreatment to a value below 30 ml/min, capecitabine should be discontinued. These dose adjustment \nrecommendations for renal impairment apply both to monotherapy and combination use (see also \nsection “Elderly” below). \n \nElderly \nDuring capecitabine monotherapy, no adjustment of the starting dose is needed. However, grade 3 or 4 \ntreatment-related adverse reactions were more frequent in patients ≥60 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. \nWhen capecitabine was used in combination with other medicinal products, elderly patients \n(≥65 years) experienced more grade 3 and grade 4 adverse drug reactions, including those leading to \ndiscontinuation, compared to younger patients. Careful monitoring of patients ≥60 years of age is \nadvisable. \n- In combination with docetaxel: an increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse \n\nreactions and treatment-related serious adverse reactions were observed in patients 60 years of \nage or more (see section 5.1). For patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% (950 mg/m2 twice daily) is recommended. If no toxicity is observed in \npatients ≥60 years of age treated with a reduced capecitabine starting dose in combination with \ndocetaxel, the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1250 mg/m2 twice daily. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of capecitabine in the paediatric population in the indications colon, \ncolorectal, gastric and breast cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nCapecitabine SUN tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or \n\nfluorouracil. \n- History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy. \n- In patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4). \n- During pregnancy and lactation. \n- In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. \n- In patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n- In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min). \n- Treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues, such as brivudine (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n- If contraindications exist to any of the medicinal products in the combination regimen, that \n\nmedicinal product should not be used. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome \n(hand-foot skin reaction, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Most adverse reactions are reversible and \ndo not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheld or \nreduced. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea. Patients with severe diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and \nelectrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. Standard antidiarrhoeal treatments (e.g. \nloperamide) may be used. NCIC CTC grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day \nor nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhoea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and \nmalabsorption. Grade 4 diarrhoea is an increase of ≥10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhoea or the \nneed for parenteral support. Dose reduction should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nDehydration. Dehydration should be prevented or corrected at the onset. Patients with anorexia, \nasthenia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea may rapidly become dehydrated. Dehydration may cause acute \nrenal failure, especially in patients with pre-existing compromised renal function or when capecitabine \nis given concomitantly with known nephrotoxic drugs. Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration \nmight be potentially fatal. If grade 2 (or higher) dehydration occurs, capecitabine treatment should be \nimmediately interrupted and the dehydration corrected. Treatment should not be restarted until the \npatient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. Dose \nmodifications applied should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHand-foot syndrome (also known as hand-foot skin reaction or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or \nchemotherapy induced acral erythema). Grade 1 hand- foot syndrome is defined as numbness, \ndysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort which does not disrupt the patient’s normal activities. \nGrade 2 hand- foot syndrome is painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort affecting the patient’s activities of daily living. \nGrade 3 hand- foot syndrome is moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the \nhands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform \nactivities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand- foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine \nshould be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 \nhand-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. When capecitabine and \ncisplatin are used in combination, the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is not advised for symptomatic \nor secondary prophylactic treatment of hand-foot syndrome, because of published reports that it may \ndecrease the efficacy of cisplatin. There is some evidence that dexpanthenol is effective for hand-foot \nsyndrome prophylaxis in patients treated with capecitabine. \n \nCardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity has been associated with fluoropyrimidine therapy, including \nmyocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and \nelectrocardiographic changes (including very rare cases of QT prolongation). These adverse reactions \nmay be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrhythmias \n(including ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, and bradycardia), angina pectoris, myocardial \ninfarction, heart failure and cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients receiving capecitabine. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with history of significant cardiac disease, arrhythmias and \nangina pectoris (see section 4.8). \n \nHypo- or hypercalcaemia. Hypo- or hypercalcaemia has been reported during capecitabine treatment. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with pre-existing hypo- or hypercalcaemia (see section 4.8). \n\nCentral or peripheral nervous system disease. Caution must be exercised in patients with central or \nperipheral nervous system disease, e.g. brain metastasis or neuropathy (see section 4.8). \n \nDiabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances. Caution must be exercised in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or electrolyte disturbances, as these may be aggravated during capecitabine treatment. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulation. In a drug interaction study with single-dose warfarin \nadministration, there was a significant increase in the mean AUC (+57%) of S-warfarin. These results \nsuggest an interaction, probably due to an inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system \nby capecitabine. Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative \nanticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored \nclosely and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \nHepatic impairment. In the absence of safety and efficacy data in patients with hepatic impairment, \ncapecitabine use should be carefully monitored in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, \nregardless of the presence or absence of liver metastasis. Administration of capecitabine should be \ninterrupted if treatment-related elevations in bilirubin of >3.0 x ULN or treatment-related elevations in \nhepatic aminotransferases (ALT, AST) of >2.5 x ULN occur. Treatment with capecitabine \nmonotherapy may be resumed when bilirubin decreases to ≤3.0 x ULN or hepatic aminotransferases \ndecrease to ≤ 2.5 x ULN. \n \nRenal impairment. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min) is increased compared to the overall population (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nDPD deficiency. Rarely, unexpected, severe toxicity (e.g. stomatitis, diarrhoea, neutropenia and \nneurotoxicity) associated with 5-FU has been attributed to a deficiency of DPD activity. A link \nbetween decreased levels of DPD and increased, potentially fatal toxic effects of 5-FU therefore \ncannot be excluded. \nPatients with known DPD deficiency should not be treated with capecitabine (see section 4.3). In \npatients with unrecognised DPD deficiency treated with capecitabine, life-threatening toxicities \nmanifesting as acute overdose may occur (see section 4.9). In the event of grade 2-4 acute toxicity, \ntreatment must be discontinued immediately until observed toxicity resolves. Permanent \ndiscontinuation should be considered based on clinical assessment of the onset, duration and severity \nof the observed toxicities. \n \nOphthalmologic complications. Patients should be carefully monitored for ophthalmological \ncomplications such as keratitis and corneal disorders, especially if they have a prior history of eye \ndisorders. Treatment of eye disorders should be initiated as clinically appropriate. \n \nSevere skin reactions. Capecitabine can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Capecitabine should be permanently discontinued in \npatients who experience a severe skin reaction during treatment. \n \nExcipients. As this medicinal product contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient, patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nCytochrome P-450 2C9 substrates: Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction studies \nbetween capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised \nwhen capecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 substrates (e.g., phenytoin). See also interaction with \ncoumarin-derivative anticoagulants below, and section 4.4. \n\nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulants: altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been \nreported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such \nas warfarin and phenprocoumon. These reactions occurred within several days and up to several \nmonths after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping \ncapecitabine. In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study, after a single 20 mg dose of warfarin, \ncapecitabine treatment increased the AUC of S-warfarin by 57% with a 91% increase in INR value. \nSince metabolism of R-warfarin was not affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down-\nregulates isozyme 2C9, but has no effect on isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking coumarin-\nderivative anticoagulants concomitantly with capecitabine should be monitored regularly for \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nalterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) and the anti-coagulant dose adjusted \naccordingly. \n \nPhenytoin: increased phenytoin plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of phenytoin \nintoxication in single cases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with phenytoin. \nPatients taking phenytoin concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased \nphenytoin plasma concentrations. \n \nFolinic acid/folic acid: a combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic \nacid has no major effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic \nacid has an effect on the pharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicity may be enhanced by \nfolinic acid: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen \nis 3000 mg/m2 per day whereas it is only 2000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was combined with \nfolinic acid (30 mg orally bid). The enhanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV \nto a capecitabine regimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid supplementation for folate \ndeficiency due to the similarity between folinic acid and folic acid. \n \nSorivudine and analogues: a clinically significant drug-drug interaction between sorivudine and 5-FU, \nresulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by sorivudine, has been described. \nThis interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially fatal. Therefore, \ncapecitabine must not be administered concomitantly with sorivudine or its chemically related \nanalogues, such as brivudine (see section 4.3). There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between \nend of treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues such as brivudine and start of \ncapecitabine therapy. \n \nAntacid: the effect of an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid on the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma \nconcentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite (5’-DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major \nmetabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL). \n \nAllopurinol: interactions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU; with possible decreased \nefficacy of 5-FU. Concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine should be avoided. \n \nInterferon alpha: the MTD of capecitabine was 2000 mg/m2 per day when combined with interferon \nalpha-2a (3 MIU/m2 per day) compared to 3000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was used alone. \n \nRadiotherapy: the MTD of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000 mg/m2 per day, \nwhereas, when combined with radiotherapy for rectal cancer, the MTD of capecitabine is 2000 mg/m2 \nper day using either a continuous schedule or given daily Monday through Friday during a 6-week \ncourse of radiotherapy. \n \nOxaliplatin: no clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free \nplatinum or total platinum occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with \noxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. \n \nBevacizumab: there was no clinically significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of capecitabine or its metabolites in the presence of oxaliplatin. \n \nFood interaction \nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. \nSince current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that \ncapecitabine be administered with food. Administration with food decreases the rate of capecitabine \nabsorption (see section 5.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with capecitabine. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving capecitabine, the \npotential hazard to the foetus must be explained. An effective method of contraception should be used \nduring treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using capecitabine; however, it should be assumed that \ncapecitabine may cause foetal harm if administered to pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity \nstudies in animals, capecitabine administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. These \nfindings are expected effects of fluoropyrimidine derivatives. Capecitabine is contraindicated during \npregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIt is not known whether capecitabine is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating mice, considerable \namounts of capecitabine and its metabolites were found in milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with capecitabine. \n \nFertility \nThere is no data on capecitabine and impact on fertility. The capecitabine pivotal studies included \nfemales of childbearing potential and males only if they agreed to use an acceptable method of birth \ncontrol to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a reasonable period thereafter. \nIn animal studies effects on fertility were observed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCapecitabine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Capecitabine \nmay cause dizziness, fatigue and nausea. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of capecitabine is based on data from over 3000 patients treated with \ncapecitabine as monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in \nmultiple indications. The safety profiles of capecitabine monotherapy for the metastatic breast cancer, \nmetastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant colon cancer populations are comparable. See section 5.1 for \ndetails of major studies, including study designs and major efficacy results. \n \nThe most commonly reported and/or clinically relevant treatment-related adverse drug reactions \n(ADRs) were gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \nstomatitis), hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, \ncardiotoxicity, increased renal dysfunction on those with preexisting compromised renal function, and \nthrombosis/embolism. \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nADRs considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or remotely related to the \nadministration of capecitabine are listed in table 4 for capecitabine given as a monotherapy and in \ntable 5 for capecitabine given in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications. The following headings are used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000).

ADRs are added according to the highest \nincidence seen in any of the major combination trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHand-foot syndrome (see section 4.4) \nFor the capecitabine dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks, a frequency of \n53% to 60% of all-grades HFS was observed in capecitabine monotherapy trials (comprising studies in \nadjuvant therapy in colon cancer, treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and treatment of breast \ncancer) and a frequency of 63% was observed in the capecitabine/docetaxel arm for the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer. For the capecitabine dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every \n3 weeks, a frequency of 22% to 30% of all-grade HFS was observed in capecitabine combination \ntherapy. \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that HFS (all grades) occurred in \n2066 (43%) patients after a median time of 239 [95% CI 201, 288] days after starting treatment with \ncapecitabine. In all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS: increasing capecitabine starting dose (gram), \ndecreasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg), increasing relative dose intensity in the first six \nweeks, increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year increments), female \ngender, and good ECOG performance status at baseline (0 versus ≥1). \n \nDiarrhoea (see section 4.4) \nCapecitabine can induce the occurrence of diarrhoea, which has been observed in up to 50% of \npatients. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically \nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing capecitabine \nstarting dose (gram), increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year \nincrements), and female gender. The following covariates were statistically significantly associated \nwith a decreased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg) and \nincreasing relative dose intensity in the first six weeks. \n \nCardiotoxicity (see section 4.4) \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, the following ADRs with an incidence of less than \n0.1% were associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis from \nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials including 949 patients (2 phase III and 5 phase II clinical trials \nin metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer): cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, sudden \ndeath, and ventricular extrasystoles. \n \nEncephalopathy \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, and based on the above pooled analysis from \nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials, encephalopathy was also associated with the use of \ncapecitabine monotherapy with an incidence of less than 0.1%. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (see section 4.2) \nAn analysis of safety data in patients ≥60 years of age treated with capecitabine monotherapy and an \nanalysis of patients treated with capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy showed an increase \nin the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and treatment-related serious \nadverse reactions compared to patients <60 years of age.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in the Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe manifestations of acute overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, gastrointestinal \nirritation and bleeding, and bone marrow depression. Medical management of overdose should include \ncustomary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical \nmanifestations and preventing their possible complications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: \nL01BC06 \n \nCapecitabine is a non-cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which functions as an orally \nadministered precursor of the cytotoxic moiety 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Capecitabine is activated via \nseveral enzymatic steps (see section 5.2). The enzyme involved in the final conversion to 5-FU, \nthymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase), is found in tumour tissues, but also in normal tissues, albeit \nusually at lower levels. In human cancer xenograft models capecitabine demonstrated a synergistic \neffect in combination with docetaxel, which may be related to the upregulation of thymidine \nphosphorylase by docetaxel. \n \nThere is evidence that the metabolism of 5-FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation \nreaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thereby interfering with the synthesis of \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The incorporation of 5-FU also leads to inhibition of RNA and protein \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nsynthesis. Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of 5-FU may be \nto create a thymidine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of a cell. The effects of \nDNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which proliferate more rapidly and which \nmetabolise 5-FU at a more rapid rate. \n \nColon and colorectal cancer  \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in adjuvant colon cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes’ C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of patients with \ncolon cancer (XACT Study; M66001). In this trial, 1987 patients were randomised to treatment with \ncapecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as \n\n3-week cycles for 24 weeks) or 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo Clinic regimen: 20 mg/m2\n \nleucovorin IV \n\nfollowed by 425 mg/m2\n \nIV bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for 24 weeks). Capecitabine was \n\nat least equivalent to IV 5-FU/LV in disease-free survival in per protocol population (hazard ratio \n0.92; 95% CI 0.80 - 1.06). In the all-randomised population, tests for difference of capecitabine vs. \n5-FU/LV in disease-free and overall survival showed hazard ratios of 0.88 (95% CI 0.77 - 1.01; p \n= 0.068) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 - 1.01; p = 0.060), respectively. The median follow up at the time of \nthe analysis was 6.9 years. In a preplanned multivariate Cox analysis, superiority of capecitabine \ncompared with bolus 5-FU/LV was demonstrated. The following factors were pre-specified in the \nstatistical analysis plan for inclusion in the model: age, time from surgery to randomization, gender, \nCEA levels at baseline, lymph nodes at baseline, and country. In the all-randomised population, \ncapecitabine was shown to be superior to 5FU/LV for disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.849; 95% \nCI 0.739 - 0.976; p = 0.0212), as well as for overall survival (hazard ratio 0.828; 95% CI \n0.705 - 0.971; p = 0.0203). \n \nCombination therapy in adjuvant colon cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes’ C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) \nfor the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer (NO16968 study). In this trial, 944 patients \nwere randomised to 3-week cycles for 24 weeks with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for \n2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period) in combination with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 intravenous \ninfusion over 2-hours on day 1 every 3 weeks); 942 patients were randomised to bolus 5-FU and \nleucovorin. In the primary analysis for DFS in the ITT population, XELOX was shown to be \nsignificantly superior to 5-FU/LV (HR=0.80, 95% CI=[0.69; 0.93]; p=0.0045). The 3 year DFS rate \nwas 71% for XELOX versus 67% for 5-FU/LV. The analysis for the secondary endpoint of RFS \nsupports these results with a HR of 0.78 (95% CI=[0.67; 0.92]; p=0.0024) for XELOX vs. 5-FU/LV. \nXELOX showed a trend towards superior OS with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI=[0.72; 1.05]; p=0.1486) \nwhich translates into a 13% reduction in risk of death. The 5 year OS rate was 78% for XELOX versus \n74% for 5-FU/LV. The efficacy data is based on a median observation time of 59 months for OS and \n57 months for DFS. The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in the XELOX \ncombination therapy arm (21%) as compared with that of the 5-FU/LV monotherapy arm (9%) in the \nITT population. \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from two identically-designed, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trials \n(SO14695; SO14796) support the use of capecitabine for first line treatment of metastatic colorectal \ncancer. In these trials, 603 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice \n\ndaily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-week cycles). 604 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo regimen: 20 mg/m2\n\n \nleucovorin IV followed \n\nby 425 mg/m2\n \nIV bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days). The overall objective response rates in \n\nthe all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 25.7% (capecitabine) vs. 16.7% (Mayo \nregimen); p <0.0002. The median time to progression was 140 days (capecitabine) vs. 144 days (Mayo \nregimen). Median survival was 392 days (capecitabine) vs. 391 days (Mayo regimen). Currently, no \ncomparative data are available on capecitabine monotherapy in colorectal cancer in comparison with \nfirst line combination regimens. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n \nCombination therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16966) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for \nthe first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The study contained two parts: an initial 2-arm \npart in which 634 patients were randomised to two different treatment groups, including XELOX or \nFOLFOX-4, and a subsequent 2x2 factorial part in which 1401 patients were randomised to four \ndifferent treatment groups, including XELOX plus placebo, FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, XELOX plus \nbevacizumab, and FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab.

The results indicate that XELOX is \nequivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 7). A comparison of XELOX plus \nbevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab was a pre-specified exploratory analysis. In this \ntreatment subgroup comparison, XELOX plus bevacizumab was similar compared to FOLFOX-4 plus \nbevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.01; 97.5% CI 0.84 - 1.22). The \nmedian follow up at the time of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 1.5 years; \ndata from analyses following an additional 1 year of follow up are also included in table 7. However, \nthe on-treatment PFS analysis did not confirm the results of the general PFS and OS analysis: the \nhazard ratio of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 was 1.24 with 97.5% CI 1.07 - 1.44. Although sensitivity \nanalyses show that differences in regimen schedules and timing of tumor assessments impact the on-\ntreatment PFS analysis, a full explanation for this result has not been found.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nTable 7 Key efficacy results for the non-inferiority analysis of study NO16966 \nPRIMARY ANALYSIS  \n\nXELOX/XELOX+P/ XELOX+BV  \n(EPP*: N=967; ITT**: N=1017)  \n\nFOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/ FOLFOX-4+BV  \n(EPP*: N = 937; ITT**: N= 1017)  \n\nPopulation  Median Time to Event (Days)  HR  \n(97.5% CI)  \n\nParameter: Progression-free Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n241  \n244  \n\n259  \n259  \n\n1.05 (0.94; 1.18)  \n1.04 (0.93; 1.16)  \n\nParameter: Overall Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n577  \n581  \n\n549  \n553  \n\n0.97 (0.84; 1.14)  \n0.96 (0.83; 1.12)  \n\nADDITIONAL 1 YEAR OF FOLLOW UP  \nPopulation  Median Time to Event (Days)  HR  \n\n(97.5% CI)  \nParameter: Progression-free Survival  \n\nEPP  \nITT  \n\n242  \n244  \n\n259  \n259  \n\n1.02 (0.92; 1.14)  \n1.01 (0.91; 1.12)  \n\nParameter: Overall Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n600  \n602  \n\n594  \n596  \n\n1.00 (0.88; 1.13)  \n0.99 (0.88; 1.12)  \n\n*EPP=eligible patient population; **ITT=intent-to-treat population \n \nIn a randomised, controlled phase III study (CAIRO), the effect of using capecitabine at a starting dose \nof 1000 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan for the first-line treatment of \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer was studied. 820 Patients were randomised to receive either \nsequential treatment (n=410) or combination treatment (n=410). Sequential treatment consisted of \nfirst-line capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days), second-line irinotecan (350 mg/m2 on day \n1), and third-line combination of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) with oxaliplatin \n(130 mg/m2 on day 1). Combination treatment consisted of first-line capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice \ndaily for 14 days) combined with irinotecan (250 mg /m2 on day 1) (XELIRI) and second-line \ncapecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 on day 1). All \ntreatment cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. In first-line treatment the median \nprogression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was 5.8 months (95%CI 5.1 - 6.2 months) \nfor capecitabine monotherapy and 7.8 months (95%CI 7.0 - 8.3 months; p=0.0002) for XELIRI. \nHowever this was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenia \nduring first-line treatment with XELIRI (26% and 11% for XELIRI and first line capecitabine \nrespectively). \n \nThe XELIRI has been compared with 5-FU + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in three randomised studies in \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The XELIRI regimens included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily on days 1 to 14 of a three-week cycle combined with irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day 1. In the \nlargest study (BICC-C), patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=144), \nbolus 5-FU (mIFL) (n=145) or XELIRI (n=141) and were additionally randomised to receive either \ndouble-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 \nmonths for mIFL (p=0.004) for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for XELIRI \n(p=0.015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (p=0.09), and 18.9 \nmonths for XELIRI (p=0.27). Patients treated with XELIRI experienced excessive gastrointestinal \ntoxicity compared with FOLFIRI (diarrhoea 48% and 14% for XELIRI and FOLFIRI respectively). \n \nIn the EORTC study patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=41) or \nXELIRI (n=44) with additional randomisation to either double-blind treatment with celecoxib or \nplacebo. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were shorter for XELIRI versus FOLFIRI (PFS \n5.9 versus 9.6 months and OS 14.8 versus 19.9 months), in addition to which excessive rates of \ndiarrhoea were reported in patients receiving the XELIRI regimen (41% XELIRI, 5.1% FOLFIRI). \n \nIn the study published by Skof et al, patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI or XELIRI. \nOverall response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p=0.76).

Toxcity was similar between treatments with the exception of \nneutropenia reported more commonly in patients treated with FOLFIRI. \n \nMontagnani et al used the results from the above three studies to provide an overall analysis of \nrandomised studies comparing FOLFIRI and XELIRI treatment regimens in the treatment of mCRC. \nA significant reduction in the risk of progression was associated with FOLFIRI (HR, 0.76; 95%CI, \n0.62-0.95; P <0.01), a result partly due to poor tolerance to the XELIRI regimens used. \n \nData from a randomised clinical study (Souglakos et al, 2012) comparing FOLFIRI + bevacizumab \nwith XELIRI + bevacizumab showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between treatments. \nPatients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Arm-A, n=167) or XELIRI \nplus bevacizumab (Arm-B, n-166). For Arm B, the XELIRI regimen used capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily for 14 days + irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day 1. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was \n10.0 and 8.9 months; p=0.64, overall survival 25.7 and 27.5 months; p=0.55 and response rates 45.5 \nand 39.8%; p=0.32 for FOLFIRI-Bev and XELIRI-Bev, respectively. Patients treated with XELIRI + \nbevacizumab reported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and hand-foot \nskin reactions than patients treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab with significantly increased \ntreatment delays, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations. \n \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase II study (AIO KRK 0604) supports the use of \ncapecitabine at a starting dose of 800 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan \nand bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 120 Patients \nwere randomised to a modified XELIRI regimen with capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily for two \nweeks followed by a 7-day rest period), irinotecan (200 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion on day 1 every \n3 weeks), and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks); 127 \npatients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for two weeks \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 as a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), \nand bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks). Following a mean \nduration of follow-up for the study population of 26.2 months, treatment responses were as shown \nbelow:  \n \nTable 8  Key efficacy results for AIO KRK study \n XELOX + bevacizumab \n\n \n\n(ITT: N=127) \n\nModified XELIRI+ \n\nbevacizumab \n\n(ITT: N= 120) \n\nHazard ratio \n\n95% CI \n\nP value \n\nProgression-free Survival after 6 months \nITT \n\n95% CI \n76% \n\n69 - 84% \n84%  \n\n77 - 90% \n- \n\nMedian progression free survival \nITT \n\n95% CI \n10.4 months \n\n9.0 - 12.0 \n12.1 months \n\n10.8 - 13.2 \n0.93 \n\n0.82 - 1.07 \n\nP=0.30 \n\nMedian overall survival \nITT \n\n95% CI \n\n24.4 months \n\n19.3 - 30.7 \n\n25.5 months \n\n21.0 - 31.0 \n\n0.90 \n\n0.68 - 1.19 \n\nP=0.45 \n\n \nCombination therapy in second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16967) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin for the second-line treatment of metastastic colorectal \ncancer. In this trial, 627 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have received prior \ntreatment with irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine regimen as first line therapy were \nrandomised to treatment with XELOX or FOLFOX-4. For the dosing schedule of XELOX and \nFOLFOX-4 (without addition of placebo or bevacizumab), refer to table 6. XELOX was demonstrated \nto be non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 in terms of progression-free survival in the per-protocol population \nand intent-to-treat population (see table 9). The results indicate that XELOX is equivalent to \nFOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 9).

In this trial, 160 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2\n\n \n\ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2\n \nas a 2-hour infusion \n\nevery 3 weeks). A total of 156 patients were randomised to treatment with 5-FU (800 mg/m2\n \nper day, \n\ncontinuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2\n \nas a 2-hour infusion on day \n\n1, every 3 weeks). Capecitabine in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior to 5-FU in \ncombination with cisplatin in terms of progression-free survival in the per protocol analysis (hazard \nratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 - 1.04). The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (capecitabine + \ncisplatin) versus 5.0 months (5-FU + cisplatin). The hazard ratio for duration of survival (overall \nsurvival) was similar to the hazard ratio for progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI \n0.64 - 1.13). The median duration of survival was 10.5 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus \n9.3 months (5-FU + cisplatin). \n \nData from a randomised multicentre, phase III study comparing capecitabine to 5-FU and oxaliplatin \nto cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line \ntreatment of advanced gastric cancer (REAL-2). In this trial, 1002 patients were randomised in a 2x2 \nfactorial design to one of the following 4 arms: \n \n- ECF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) and 5-FU (200 mg/m2\n \ndaily given by continuous infusion \n\nvia a central line). \n- ECX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2\n \ntwice daily continuously).  \n\n- EOF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and 5-FU (200 mg/m2\n\n \ndaily given by continuous \n\ninfusion via a central line).  \n- EOX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \n\na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily \ncontinuously). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy analyses in the per protocol population demonstrated non-inferiority in overall \nsurvival for capecitabine vs. 5-FU-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.99) and for \noxaliplatin vs. cisplatin-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80 - 1.1). The median overall \nsurvival was 10.9 months in capecitabine-based regimens and 9.6 months in 5-FU based regimens. \nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months in cisplatin-based regimens and 10.4 months in \noxaliplatin-based regimens. \n \nCapecitabine has also been used in combination with oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric \ncancer. Studies with capecitabine monotherapy indicate that capecitabine has activity in advanced \ngastric cancer. \n \nColon, colorectal and advanced gastric cancer: meta-analysis \nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials (studies SO14695, SO14796, M66001, NO16966, NO16967, \nM17032) supports capecitabine replacing 5-FU in mono- and combination treatment in gastrointestinal \ncancer. The pooled analysis includes 3097 patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and \n3074 patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. Median overall survival time was 703 days \n(95% CI: 671; 745) in patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and 683 days (95% CI: \n646; 715) in patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. The hazard ratio for overall survival was \n0.94 (95% CI: 0.89; 1.00, p=0.0489) indicating that capecitabine-containing regimens are non-inferior \nto 5-FU-containing regimens. \n \nBreast cancer \n \nCombination therapy with capecitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with docetaxel for treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this \ntrial, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for \n\n2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period and docetaxel 75 mg/m2\n \nas a 1 hour intravenous infusion \n\nevery 3 weeks). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2\n \nas a \n\n1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel \ncombination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel combination arm (p<0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine after failure of taxanes, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, and \nfor whom anthracycline therapy is not indicated  \nData from two multicentre phase II clinical trials support the use of capecitabine monotherapy for \ntreatment of patients after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or \nfor whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In these trials, a total of 236 patients were \ntreated with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). The \n\noverall objective response rates (investigator assessment) were 20% (first trial) and 25% (second trial). \nThe median time to progression was 93 and 98 days. Median survival was 384 and 373 days. \n \nAll indications \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that patients on capecitabine who \ndeveloped hand-foot syndrome (HFS) had a longer overall survival compared to patients who did not \ndevelop HFS: median overall survival 1100 days (95% CI 1007;1200) vs. 691 days (95% CI 638;754) \nwith a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.56; 0.66). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to conduct studies with the reference \nmedicinal product containing capecitabine in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nadenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, gastric adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of capecitabine have been evaluated over a dose range of 502-3514 mg/m2/day. \nThe parameters of capecitabine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine \n(5'-DFUR) measured on days 1 and 14 were similar. The AUC of 5-FU was 30%-35% higher on day \n14. Capecitabine dose reduction decreases systemic exposure to 5-FU more than dose-proportionally, \ndue to non-linear pharmacokinetics for the active metabolite. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration, capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, followed by extensive \nconversion to the metabolites, 5'-DFCR and 5'-DFUR. Administration with food decreases the rate of \ncapecitabine absorption, but only results in a minor effect on the AUC of 5'-DFUR, and on the AUC of \nthe subsequent metabolite 5-FU. At the dose of 1250 mg/m2\n\n \non day 14 with administration after food \n\nintake, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax in μg/ml) for capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and \nFBAL were 4.67, 3.05, 12.1, 0.95 and 5.46 respectively. The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax \nin hours) were 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.00 and 3.34. The AUC0-∞ values in μg•h/ml were 7.75, 7.24, 24.6, \n2.03 and 36.3. \n \nDistribution  \nIn vitro human plasma studies have determined that capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR and 5-FU are \n54%, 10%, 62% and 10% protein bound, mainly to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation  \nCapecitabine is first metabolised by hepatic carboxylesterase to 5'-DFCR, which is then converted to \n5'-DFUR by cytidine deaminase, principally located in the liver and tumour tissues. Further catalytic \nactivation of 5'-DFUR then occurs by thymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase). The enzymes involved in \nthe catalytic activation are found in tumour tissues but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower \nlevels. The sequential enzymatic biotransformation of capecitabine to 5-FU leads to higher \nconcentrations within tumour tissues. In the case of colorectal tumours, 5-FU generation appears to be \nin large part localised in tumour stromal cells. Following oral administration of capecitabine to \npatients with colorectal cancer, the ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumours to adjacent \ntissues was 3.2 (ranged from 0.9 to 8.0). The ratio of 5-FU concentration in tumour to plasma was 21.4 \n(ranged from 3.9 to 59.9, n=8) whereas the ratio in healthy tissues to plasma was 8.9 (ranged from 3.0 \nto 25.8, n=8). Thymidine phosphorylase activity was measured and found to be 4 times greater in \nprimary colorectal tumour than in adjacent normal tissue. According to immunohistochemical studies, \nthymidine phosphorylase appears to be in large part localised in tumour stromal cells. \n \n5-FU is further catabolised by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to the much less \ntoxic dihydro-5-fluorouracil (FUH2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield \n5-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA). Finally, β-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to α-fluoro-β-\nalanine (FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity is the \nrate limiting step. Deficiency of DPD may lead to increased toxicity of capecitabine (see section 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life (t1/2 in hours) of capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL were \n0.85, 1.11, 0.66, 0.76 and 3.23 respectively. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly \nexcreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Faecal excretion is \nminimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL, which represents 57% of the \nadministered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged capecitabine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \nCombination therapy  \nPhase I studies evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of either docetaxel or \npaclitaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel or \npaclitaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel or paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of \n5’-DFUR. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after capecitabine treatment of 505 patients \nwith colorectal cancer dosed at 1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily. Gender, presence or absence of liver \n\nmetastasis at baseline, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin, serum albumin, ASAT and \nALAT had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment due to liver metastases: According to a pharmacokinetic study in \ncancer patients with mild to moderate liver impairment due to liver metastases, the bioavailability of \ncapecitabine and exposure to 5-FU may increase compared to patients with no liver impairment. There \nare no pharmacokinetic data on patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: Based on a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to \nsevere renal impairment, there is no evidence for an effect of creatinine clearance on the \npharmacokinetics of intact drug and 5-FU. Creatinine clearance was found to influence the systemic \nexposure to 5’-DFUR (35% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%) and to \nFBAL (114% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%). FBAL is a metabolite \nwithout antiproliferative activity. \n \nElderly: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included patients with a wide range \nof ages (27 to 86 years) and included 234 (46%) patients greater or equal to 65, age has no influence \non the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR and 5-FU. The AUC of FBAL increased with age (20% increase \nin age results in a 15% increase in the AUC of FBAL). This increase is likely due to a change in renal \nfunction. \n \nEthnic factors: Following oral administration of 825 mg/m2\n\n \ncapecitabine twice daily for 14 days, \n\nJapanese patients (n=18) had about 36% lower Cmax and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than \nCaucasian patients (n=22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower Cmax and 34% lower AUC for \nFBAL than Caucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is unknown. No significant \ndifferences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, daily oral administration of capecitabine to cynomolgus monkeys and \nmice produced toxic effects on the gastrointestinal, lymphoid and haemopoietic systems, typical for \nfluoropyrimidines. These toxicities were reversible. Skin toxicity, characterised by \ndegenerative/regressive changes, was observed with capecitabine. Capecitabine was devoid of hepatic \nand CNS toxicities. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. PR- and QT-interval prolongation) was detectable in \ncynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration (100 mg/kg) but not after repeated oral dosing \n(1379 mg/m2/day). \n \nA two-year mouse carcinogenicity study produced no evidence of carcinogenicity by capecitabine. \n \nDuring standard fertility studies, impairment of fertility was observed in female mice receiving \ncapecitabine; however, this effect was reversible after a drug-free period. In addition, during a \n13-week study, atrophic and degenerative changes occurred in reproductive organs of male mice; \nhowever these effects were reversible after a drug-free period (see section 4.6). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nIn embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies in mice, dose-related increases in foetal resorption and \nteratogenicity were observed. In monkeys, abortion and embryolethality were observed at high doses, \nbut there was no evidence of teratogenicity. \n \nCapecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster \nV79/HPRT gene mutation assay). However, similar to other nucleoside analogues (ie, 5-FU), \ncapecitabine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes (in vitro) and a positive trend occurred in mouse \nbone marrow micronucleus tests (in vivo). \n \n \n6.

Capecitabine is also indicated as monotherapy for the \ntreatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of taxanes and an \nanthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or for whom further anthracycline therapy is not \nindicated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the utilisation of \nanti-neoplastic medicinal products. Careful monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is \nrecommended for all patients.  \nTreatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable toxicity is observed. Standard \nand reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for starting doses of capecitabine of \n1250 mg/m2 and 1000 mg/m2 are provided in tables 1 and 2, respectively. \n \nPosology \n \nRecommended posology (see section 5.1): \n \nMonotherapy \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nColon, colorectal and breast cancer \nGiven as monotherapy, the recommended starting dose for capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of \ncolon cancer, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or of locally advanced or metastatic \nbreast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 administered twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to \n2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Adjuvant treatment in \npatients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months. \n \nCombination therapy  \nColon, colorectal and gastric cancer \nIn combination treatment, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine should be reduced to \n800 - 1000 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, or to \n625 mg/m2 twice daily when administered continuously (see section 5.1). For combination with \nirinotecan, the recommended starting dose is 800 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1. The inclusion of \nbevacizumab in a combination regimen has no effect on the starting dose of capecitabine. \nPremedication to maintain adequate hydration and anti-emesis according to the cisplatin summary of \nproduct characteristics should be started prior to cisplatin administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus cisplatin combination. Premedication with antiemetics according to the oxaliplatin \nsummary of product characteristics is recommended for patients receiving the capecitabine plus \noxaliplatin combination. Adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended \nfor a duration of 6 months. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn combination with docetaxel, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine in the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, \ncombined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Pre-medication \nwith an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone according to the docetaxel summary of product \ncharacteristics should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel combination. \n \nCapecitabine dose calculations \n \nTable 1 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose \n\nof capecitabine of 1250 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1250 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n\n \n Full dose  \n\n1250 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg \ntablets and/or  \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \nadministration to be \ngiven morning and \n\nevening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n950 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n625 mg/m2 \n\nBody Surface \nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\n \n150 mg \n\n \n\n \n500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n≤1.26 1500 - 3 1150 800 \n1.27 - 1.38 1650 1 3 1300 800 \n1.39 - 1.52 1800 2 3 1450 950 \n1.53 - 1.66 2000 - 4 1500 1000 \n1.67 - 1.78 2150 1 4 1650 1000 \n1.79 - 1.92 2300 2 4 1800 1150 \n1.93 - 2.06 2500 - 5 1950 1300 \n2.07 - 2.18 2650 1 5 2000 1300 \n≥2.19 2800 2 5 2150 1450 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \nTable 2 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose \n\nof capecitabine of 1000 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1000 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n\n \n Full dose  \n\n \n \n\n1000 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg \ntablets and/or \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \nadministration to be \ngiven morning and \n\nevening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n750 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n500 mg/m2 \n\nBody Surface \nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\n \n150 mg \n\n \n500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration  \n\n(mg) \n≤1.26 1150 1 2 800 600 \n1.27 - 1.38 1300 2 2 1000 600 \n1.39 - 1.52 1450 3 2 1100 750 \n1.53 - 1.66 1600 4 2 1200 800 \n1.67 - 1.78 1750 5 2 1300 800 \n1.79 - 1.92 1800 2 3 1400 900 \n1.93 - 2.06 2000 - 4 1500 1000 \n2.07 - 2.18 2150 1 4 1600 1050 \n≥2.19 2300 2 4 1750 1100 \n \nPosology adjustments during treatment \nGeneral \nToxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment and/or \nmodification of the dose (treatment interruption or dose reduction). Once the dose has been reduced, it \nshould not be increased at a later time. For those toxicities considered by the treating physician to be \nunlikely to become serious or life-threatening, e.g. alopecia, altered taste, nail changes, treatment can \nbe continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. Patients taking capecitabine should be \ninformed of the need to interrupt treatment immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs. Doses \nof capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced.

For hand-foot syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia, see section 4.4. \n \nHaematology  \nPatients with baseline neutrophil counts of <1.5 x 109/L and/or thrombocyte counts of  \n<100 x 109/L should not be treated with capecitabine. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a \ntreatment cycle show that the neutrophil count drops below 1.0 x 109/L or that the platelet count drops \nbelow 75 x 109/L, treatment with capecitabine should be interrupted. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to \nthe appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nAt the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine or the \nother medicinal product(s), then administration of all therapy should be delayed until the requirements \nfor restarting all medicinal products are met. \n \nDuring a treatment cycle for those toxicities considered by the treating physician not to be related to \ncapecitabine, capecitabine should be continued and the dose of the other medicinal product should be \nadjusted according to the appropriate Prescribing Information. \n \nIf the other medicinal product(s) have to be discontinued permanently, capecitabine treatment can be \nresumed when the requirements for restarting capecitabine are met. \n \nThis advice is applicable to all indications and to all special populations. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products  \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to the \nappropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nPosology adjustments for special populations \n \nHepatic impairment  \nInsufficient safety and efficacy data are available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose \nadjustment recommendation. No information is available on hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis or \nhepatitis. \n \nRenal impairment  \nCapecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below \n30 ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] at baseline). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min at baseline) is increased \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\ncompared to the overall population. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, a dose \nreduction to 75% for a starting dose of 1250 mg/m2 is recommended. In patients with moderate renal \nimpairment at baseline, no dose reduction is required for a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2. In patients \nwith mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51-80 ml/min at baseline) no adjustment of the \nstarting dose is recommended. Careful monitoring and prompt treatment interruption is recommended \nif the patient develops a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse event during treatment and subsequent dose \nadjustment as outlined in table 3 above. If the calculated creatinine clearance decreases during \ntreatment to a value below 30 ml/min, capecitabine should be discontinued. These dose adjustment \nrecommendations for renal impairment apply both to monotherapy and combination use (see also \nsection “Elderly” below). \n \nElderly \nDuring capecitabine monotherapy, no adjustment of the starting dose is needed. However, grade 3 or 4 \ntreatment-related adverse reactions were more frequent in patients ≥60 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. \nWhen capecitabine was used in combination with other medicinal products, elderly patients \n(≥65 years) experienced more grade 3 and grade 4 adverse drug reactions, including those leading to \ndiscontinuation, compared to younger patients. Careful monitoring of patients ≥60 years of age is \nadvisable. \n- In combination with docetaxel: an increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse \n\nreactions and treatment-related serious adverse reactions were observed in patients 60 years of \nage or more (see section 5.1). For patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% (950 mg/m2 twice daily) is recommended. If no toxicity is observed in \npatients ≥60 years of age treated with a reduced capecitabine starting dose in combination with \ndocetaxel, the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1250 mg/m2 twice daily. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of capecitabine in the paediatric population in the indications colon, \ncolorectal, gastric and breast cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nCapecitabine SUN tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or \n\nfluorouracil. \n- History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy. \n- In patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4). \n- During pregnancy and lactation. \n- In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. \n- In patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n- In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min). \n- Treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues, such as brivudine (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n- If contraindications exist to any of the medicinal products in the combination regimen, that \n\nmedicinal product should not be used. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome \n(hand-foot skin reaction, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Most adverse reactions are reversible and \ndo not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheld or \nreduced. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea. Patients with severe diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and \nelectrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. Standard antidiarrhoeal treatments (e.g. \nloperamide) may be used. NCIC CTC grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day \nor nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhoea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and \nmalabsorption. Grade 4 diarrhoea is an increase of ≥10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhoea or the \nneed for parenteral support. Dose reduction should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nDehydration. Dehydration should be prevented or corrected at the onset. Patients with anorexia, \nasthenia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea may rapidly become dehydrated. Dehydration may cause acute \nrenal failure, especially in patients with pre-existing compromised renal function or when capecitabine \nis given concomitantly with known nephrotoxic drugs. Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration \nmight be potentially fatal. If grade 2 (or higher) dehydration occurs, capecitabine treatment should be \nimmediately interrupted and the dehydration corrected. Treatment should not be restarted until the \npatient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. Dose \nmodifications applied should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHand-foot syndrome (also known as hand-foot skin reaction or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or \nchemotherapy induced acral erythema). Grade 1 hand- foot syndrome is defined as numbness, \ndysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort which does not disrupt the patient’s normal activities. \nGrade 2 hand- foot syndrome is painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort affecting the patient’s activities of daily living. \nGrade 3 hand- foot syndrome is moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the \nhands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform \nactivities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand- foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine \nshould be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 \nhand-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. When capecitabine and \ncisplatin are used in combination, the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is not advised for symptomatic \nor secondary prophylactic treatment of hand-foot syndrome, because of published reports that it may \ndecrease the efficacy of cisplatin. There is some evidence that dexpanthenol is effective for hand-foot \nsyndrome prophylaxis in patients treated with capecitabine. \n \nCardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity has been associated with fluoropyrimidine therapy, including \nmyocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and \nelectrocardiographic changes (including very rare cases of QT prolongation). These adverse reactions \nmay be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrhythmias \n(including ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, and bradycardia), angina pectoris, myocardial \ninfarction, heart failure and cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients receiving capecitabine. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with history of significant cardiac disease, arrhythmias and \nangina pectoris (see section 4.8).  \n \nHypo- or hypercalcaemia. Hypo- or hypercalcaemia has been reported during capecitabine treatment. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with pre-existing hypo- or hypercalcaemia (see section 4.8). \n \nCentral or peripheral nervous system disease. Caution must be exercised in patients with central or \nperipheral nervous system disease, e.g. brain metastasis or neuropathy (see section 4.8). \n \nDiabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances. Caution must be exercised in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or electrolyte disturbances, as these may be aggravated during capecitabine treatment. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulation. In a drug interaction study with single-dose warfarin \nadministration, there was a significant increase in the mean AUC (+57%) of S-warfarin. These results \nsuggest an interaction, probably due to an inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system \nby capecitabine. Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative \nanticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored \nclosely and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \nHepatic impairment. In the absence of safety and efficacy data in patients with hepatic impairment, \ncapecitabine use should be carefully monitored in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, \nregardless of the presence or absence of liver metastasis. Administration of capecitabine should be \ninterrupted if treatment-related elevations in bilirubin of >3.0 x ULN or treatment-related elevations in \nhepatic aminotransferases (ALT, AST) of >2.5 x ULN occur. Treatment with capecitabine \nmonotherapy may be resumed when bilirubin decreases to ≤3.0 x ULN or hepatic aminotransferases \ndecrease to ≤ 2.5 x ULN. \n \nRenal impairment. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min) is increased compared to the overall population (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nDPD deficiency. Rarely, unexpected, severe toxicity (e.g. stomatitis, diarrhoea, neutropenia and \nneurotoxicity) associated with 5-FU has been attributed to a deficiency of DPD activity. A link \nbetween decreased levels of DPD and increased, potentially fatal toxic effects of 5-FU therefore \ncannot be excluded. \nPatients with known DPD deficiency should not be treated with capecitabine (see section 4.3). In \npatients with unrecognised DPD deficiency treated with capecitabine, life-threatening toxicities \nmanifesting as acute overdose may occur (see section 4.9). In the event of grade 2-4 acute toxicity, \ntreatment must be discontinued immediately until observed toxicity resolves. Permanent \ndiscontinuation should be considered bases on clinical assessment of the onset, duration and severity \nof the observed toxicities. \n \nOphthalmologic complications: Patients should be carefully monitored for ophthalmological \ncomplications such as keratitis and corneal disorders, especially if they have a prior history of eye \ndisorders. Treatment of eye disorders should be initiated as clinically appropriate. \n \nSevere skin reactions: Capecitabine can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Capecitabine should be permanently discontinued in \npatients who experience a severe skin reaction during treatment. \n \nExcipients. As this medicinal product contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient, patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nCytochrome P-450 2C9 substrates: Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction studies \nbetween capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised \nwhen capecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 substrates (e.g., phenytoin). See also interaction with \ncoumarin-derivative anticoagulants below, and section 4.4. \n\nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulants: altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been \nreported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such \nas warfarin and phenprocoumon. These reactions occurred within several days and up to several \nmonths after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping \ncapecitabine. In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study, after a single 20 mg dose of warfarin, \ncapecitabine treatment increased the AUC of S-warfarin by 57% with a 91% increase in INR value. \nSince metabolism of R-warfarin was not affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down-\nregulates isozyme 2C9, but has no effect on isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking coumarin-\nderivative anticoagulants concomitantly with capecitabine should be monitored regularly for \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nalterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) and the anti-coagulant dose adjusted \naccordingly. \n \nPhenytoin: increased phenytoin plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of phenytoin \nintoxication in single cases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with phenytoin. \nPatients taking phenytoin concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased \nphenytoin plasma concentrations. \n \nFolinic acid/folic acid: a combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic \nacid has no major effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic \nacid has an effect on the pharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicity may be enhanced by \nfolinic acid: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen \nis 3000 mg/m2 per day whereas it is only 2000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was combined with \nfolinic acid (30 mg orally bid). The enhanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV \nto a capecitabine regimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid supplementation for folate \ndeficiency due to the similarity between folinic acid and folic acid. \n \nSorivudine and analogues: a clinically significant drug-drug interaction between sorivudine and 5-FU, \nresulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by sorivudine, has been described. \nThis interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially fatal. Therefore, \ncapecitabine must not be administered concomitantly with sorivudine or its chemically related \nanalogues, such as brivudine (see section 4.3). There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between \nend of treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues such as brivudine and start of \ncapecitabine therapy. \n \nAntacid: the effect of an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid on the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma \nconcentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite (5’-DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major \nmetabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL). \n \nAllopurinol: interactions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU; with possible decreased \nefficacy of 5-FU. Concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine should be avoided. \n \nInterferon alpha: the MTD of capecitabine was 2000 mg/m2 per day when combined with interferon \nalpha-2a (3 MIU/m2 per day) compared to 3000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was used alone. \n \nRadiotherapy: the MTD of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000 mg/m2 per day, \nwhereas, when combined with radiotherapy for rectal cancer, the MTD of capecitabine is 2000 mg/m2 \nper day using either a continuous schedule or given daily Monday through Friday during a 6-week \ncourse of radiotherapy. \n \nOxaliplatin: no clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free \nplatinum or total platinum occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with \noxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. \n \nBevacizumab: there was no clinically significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of capecitabine or its metabolites in the presence of oxaliplatin. \n \nFood interaction \nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. \nSince current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that \ncapecitabine be administered with food. Administration with food decreases the rate of capecitabine \nabsorption (see section 5.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with capecitabine. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving capecitabine, the \npotential hazard to the foetus must be explained. An effective method of contraception should be used \nduring treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using capecitabine; however, it should be assumed that \ncapecitabine may cause foetal harm if administered to pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity \nstudies in animals, capecitabine administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. These \nfindings are expected effects of fluoropyrimidine derivatives. Capecitabine is contraindicated during \npregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIt is not known whether capecitabine is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating mice, considerable \namounts of capecitabine and its metabolites were found in milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with capecitabine. \n \nFertility \nThere is no data on capecitabine and impact on fertility. The capecitabine pivotal studies included \nfemales of childbearing potential and males only if they agreed to use an acceptable method of birth \ncontrol to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a reasonable period thereafter. \nIn animal studies effects on fertility were observed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCapecitabine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Capecitabine \nmay cause dizziness, fatigue and nausea. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of capecitabine is based on data from over 3000 patients treated with \ncapecitabine as monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in \nmultiple indications. The safety profiles of capecitabine monotherapy for the metastatic breast cancer, \nmetastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant colon cancer populations are comparable. See section 5.1 for \ndetails of major studies, including study designs and major efficacy results. \n \nThe most commonly reported and/or clinically relevant treatment-related adverse drug reactions \n(ADRs) were gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \nstomatitis), hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, \ncardiotoxicity, increased renal dysfunction on those with preexisting compromised renal function, and \nthrombosis/embolism. \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nADRs considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or remotely related to the \nadministration of capecitabine are listed in table 4 for capecitabine given as a monotherapy and in \ntable 5 for capecitabine given in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications. The following headings are used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000).

For the capecitabine dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every \n3 weeks, a frequency of 22% to 30% of all-grade HFS was observed in capecitabine combination \ntherapy. \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that HFS (all grades) occurred in \n2066 (43%) patients after a median time of 239 [95% CI 201, 288] days after starting treatment with \ncapecitabine. In all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS: increasing capecitabine starting dose (gram), \ndecreasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg), increasing relative dose intensity in the first six \nweeks, increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year increments), female \ngender, and good ECOG performance status at baseline (0 versus ≥1). \n \nDiarrhoea (see section 4.4) \nCapecitabine can induce the occurrence of diarrhoea, which has been observed in up to 50% of \npatients. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically \nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing capecitabine \nstarting dose (gram), increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year \nincrements), and female gender.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe manifestations of acute overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, gastrointestinal \nirritation and bleeding, and bone marrow depression. Medical management of overdose should include \ncustomary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical \nmanifestations and preventing their possible complications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: \nL01BC06 \n \nCapecitabine is a non-cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which functions as an orally \nadministered precursor of the cytotoxic moiety 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Capecitabine is activated via \nseveral enzymatic steps (see section 5.2). The enzyme involved in the final conversion to 5-FU, \nthymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase), is found in tumour tissues, but also in normal tissues, albeit \nusually at lower levels. In human cancer xenograft models capecitabine demonstrated a synergistic \neffect in combination with docetaxel, which may be related to the upregulation of thymidine \nphosphorylase by docetaxel. \n \nThere is evidence that the metabolism of 5-FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation \nreaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thereby interfering with the synthesis of \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The incorporation of 5-FU also leads to inhibition of RNA and protein \nsynthesis. Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of 5-FU may be \nto create a thymidine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of a cell. The effects of \nDNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which proliferate more rapidly and which \nmetabolise 5-FU at a more rapid rate. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nColon and colorectal cancer  \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in adjuvant colon cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes’ C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of patients with \ncolon cancer (XACT Study; M66001). In this trial, 1987 patients were randomised to treatment with \ncapecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-\n\nweek cycles for 24 weeks) or 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo Clinic regimen: 20 mg/m2\n \nleucovorin IV \n\nfollowed by 425 mg/m2\n \nIV bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for 24 weeks). Capecitabine was \n\nat least equivalent to IV 5-FU/LV in disease-free survival in per protocol population (hazard ratio \n0.92; 95% CI 0.80-1.06). In the all-randomised population, tests for difference of capecitabine vs. \n5-FU/LV in disease-free and overall survival showed hazard ratios of 0.88 (95% CI 0.77 - 1.01; p \n= 0.068) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 - 1.01; p = 0.060), respectively. The median follow up at the time of \nthe analysis was 6.9 years. In a preplanned multivariate Cox analysis, superiority of capecitabine \ncompared with bolus 5-FU/LV was demonstrated. The following factors were pre-specified in the \nstatistical analysis plan for inclusion in the model: age, time from surgery to randomization, gender, \nCEA levels at baseline, lymph nodes at baseline, and country. In the all-randomised population, \ncapecitabine was shown to be superior to 5FU/LV for disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.849; 95% \nCI 0.739 - 0.976; p = 0.0212), as well as for overall survival (hazard ratio 0.828; 95% CI \n0.705 - 0.971; p = 0.0203). \n \nCombination therapy in adjuvant colon cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes’ C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) \nfor the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer (NO16968 study). In this trial, 944 patients \nwere randomised to 3-week cycles for 24 weeks with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for \n2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period) in combination with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 intravenous \ninfusion over 2-hours on day 1 every 3 weeks); 942 patients were randomised to bolus 5-FU and \nleucovorin. In the primary analysis for DFS in the ITT population, XELOX was shown to be \nsignificantly superior to 5-FU/LV (HR=0.80, 95% CI=[0.69; 0.93]; p=0.0045). The 3 year DFS rate \nwas 71% for XELOX versus 67% for 5-FU/LV. The analysis for the secondary endpoint of RFS \nsupports these results with a HR of 0.78 (95% CI=[0.67; 0.92]; p=0.0024) for XELOX vs. 5-FU/LV. \nXELOX showed a trend towards superior OS with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI=[0.72; 1.05]; p=0.1486) \nwhich translates into a 13% reduction in risk of death. The 5 year OS rate was 78% for XELOX versus \n74% for 5-FU/LV. The efficacy data is based on a median observation time of 59 months for OS and \n57 months for DFS. The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in the XELOX \ncombination therapy arm (21%) as compared with that of the 5-FU/LV monotherapy arm (9%) in the \nITT population. \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from two identically-designed, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trials \n(SO14695; SO14796) support the use of capecitabine for first line treatment of metastatic colorectal \ncancer. In these trials, 603 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice \n\ndaily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-week cycles). 604 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo regimen: 20 mg/m2\n\n \nleucovorin IV followed \n\nby 425 mg/m2\n \nIV bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days). The overall objective response rates in \n\nthe all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 25.7% (capecitabine) vs. 16.7% (Mayo \nregimen); p <0.0002. The median time to progression was 140 days (capecitabine) vs. 144 days (Mayo \nregimen). Median survival was 392 days (capecitabine) vs. 391 days (Mayo regimen). Currently, no \ncomparative data are available on capecitabine monotherapy in colorectal cancer in comparison with \nfirst line combination regimens. \n \nCombination therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16966) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for \nthe first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

See table 6 for treatment regimens. \n \nTable 6 Treatment regimens in study NO16966 (mCRC) \n\n Treatment  Starting Dose  Schedule  \nFOLFOX-4 \n\nor \nFOLFOX-4 + \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin \n \nLeucovorin \n \n5-Fluorouracil \n\n85 mg/m2 IV 2 hr  \n \n200 mg/m2 IV 2 hr \n \n400 mg/m2 IV bolus, \nfollowed by 600 mg/m2 \nIV 22 hr \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 2 weeks  \n \nLeucovorin on Days 1 and 2, every \n2 weeks \n5-fluorouracil IV bolus/infusion, \neach on Days 1 and 2, every 2 weeks \n\n Placebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n5 mg/kg IV 30-90 mins Day 1, prior to FOLFOX-4, every \n2 weeks \n\nXELOX \nor \n\nXELOX+ \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin \nCapecitabine \n\n130 mg/m2 IV 2 hr \n1000 mg/m2 oral twice \ndaily \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 3 weeks \nCapecitabine oral twice daily for \n2 weeks (followed by 1 week off-\ntreatment) \n\n \n \n\nPlacebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n7.5 mg/kg IV \n30-90 mins \n\nDay 1, prior to XELOX, every \n3 weeks \n\n5-Fluorouracil:       IV bolus injection immediately after leucovorin \n \nNon-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the \noverall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the eligible patient \npopulation and the intent-to-treat population (see table 7). The results indicate that XELOX is \nequivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 7). A comparison of XELOX plus \nbevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab was a pre-specified exploratory analysis. In this \ntreatment subgroup comparison, XELOX plus bevacizumab was similar compared to FOLFOX-4 plus \nbevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.01; 97.5% CI 0.84 - 1.22). The \nmedian follow up at the time of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 1.5 years; \ndata from analyses following an additional 1 year of follow up are also included in table 7. However, \nthe on-treatment PFS analysis did not confirm the results of the general PFS and OS analysis: the \nhazard ratio of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 was 1.24 with 97.5% CI 1.07 - 1.44. Although sensitivity \nanalyses show that differences in regimen schedules and timing of tumor assessments impact the on-\ntreatment PFS analysis, a full explanation for this result has not been found.  \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n au\nth\n\nor\nise\n\nd\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nTable 7 Key efficacy results for the non-inferiority analysis of study NO16966 \nPRIMARY ANALYSIS  \n\nXELOX/XELOX+P/ XELOX+BV  \n(EPP*: N=967; ITT**: N=1017)  \n\nFOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/ FOLFOX-4+BV  \n(EPP*: N = 937; ITT**: N= 1017)  \n\nPopulation  Median Time to Event (Days)  HR  \n(97.5% CI)  \n\nParameter: Progression-free Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n241  \n244  \n\n259  \n259  \n\n1.05 (0.94; 1.18)  \n1.04 (0.93; 1.16)  \n\nParameter: Overall Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n577  \n581  \n\n549  \n553  \n\n0.97 (0.84; 1.14)  \n0.96 (0.83; 1.12)  \n\nADDITIONAL 1 YEAR OF FOLLOW UP  \nPopulation  Median Time to Event (Days)  HR  \n\n(97.5% CI)  \nParameter: Progression-free Survival  \n\nEPP  \nITT  \n\n242  \n244  \n\n259  \n259  \n\n1.02 (0.92; 1.14)  \n1.01 (0.91; 1.12)  \n\nParameter: Overall Survival  \nEPP  \nITT  \n\n600  \n602  \n\n594  \n596  \n\n1.00 (0.88; 1.13)  \n0.99 (0.88; 1.12)  \n\n*EPP=eligible patient population; **ITT=intent-to-treat population \n \nIn a randomised, controlled phase III study (CAIRO), the effect of using capecitabine at a starting dose \nof 1000 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan for the first-line treatment of \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer was studied. 820 Patients were randomised to receive either \nsequential treatment (n=410) or combination treatment (n=410). Sequential treatment consisted of \nfirst-line capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days), second-line irinotecan (350 mg/m2 on day \n1), and third-line combination of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) with oxaliplatin \n(130 mg/m2 on day 1). Combination treatment consisted of first-line capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice \ndaily for 14 days) combined with irinotecan (250 mg /m2 on day 1) (XELIRI) and second-line \ncapecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 on day 1). All \ntreatment cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. In first-line treatment the median \nprogression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was 5.8 months (95%CI 5.1 - 6.2 months) \nfor capecitabine monotherapy and 7.8 months (95%CI 7.0 - 8.3 months; p=0.0002) for XELIRI. \nHowever this was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenia \nduring first-line treatment with XELIRI (26% and 11% for XELIRI and first line capecitabine \nrespectively). \n \nThe XELIRI has been compared with 5-FU + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in three randomised studies in \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The XELIRI regimens included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily on days 1 to 14 of a three-week cycle combined with irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day1. In the \nlargest study (BICC-C), patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=144), \nbolus 5-FU (mIFL) (n=145) or XELIRI (n=141) and were additionally randomised to receive either \ndouble-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 \nmonths for mIFL (p=0.004) for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for XELIRI \n(p=0.015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (p=0.09), and 18.9 \nmonths for XELIRI (p=0.27). Patients treated with XELIRI experienced excessive gastrointestinal \ntoxicity compared with FOLFIRI (diarrhoea 48% and 14% for XELIRI and FLFIRI respectively). \n \nIn the EORTC study patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=41) or \nXELIRI (n=44) with additional randomisation to either double-blind treatment with celecoxib or \nplacebo. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were shorter for XELIRI versus FOLFIRI (PFS \n5.9 versus 9.6 months and OS 14.8 versus 19.9 months), in addition to which excessive rates of \ndiarrhoea were reported in patients receiving the XELIRI regimen (41% XELIRI, 5.1% FOFIRI).  \n \nIn the study published by Skof et al, patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI or XELIRI. \nOverall response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p=0.76). At the end of \ntreatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nevidence of the disease (p=0.56). Toxcity was similar between treatments with the exception of \nneutropenia reported more commonly in patients treated with FOLFIRI. \n \nMontagnani et al used the results from the above three studies to provide an overall analysis of \nrandomised studies comparing FOLFIRI and XELIRI treatment regimens in the treatment of mCRC. \nA significant reduction in the risk of progression was associated with FOLFIRI (HR, 0.76; 95%CI, \n0.62-0.95; P <0.01), a result partly due to poor tolerance to the XELIRI regimens used. \n \nData from a randomised clinical study (Souglakos et al, 2012) comparing FOLFIRI + bevacizumab \nwith XELIRI + bevacizumab showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between treatments. \nPatients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Arm-A, n=167) or XELIRI \nplus bevacizumab (Arm-B, n-166). For Arm B, the XELIRI regimen used capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily for 14 days +irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day 1. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was \n10.0 and 8.9 months; p=0.64, overall survival 25.7 and 27.5 months; p=0.55 and response rates 45.5 \nand 39.8%; p=0.32 for FOLFIRI-Bev and XELIRI-Bev, respectively. Patients treated with XELIRI + \nbevacizumab reported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and hand-foot \nskin reactions than patients treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab with significantly increased \ntreatment delays, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations. \n \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase II study (AIO KRK 0604) supports the use of \ncapecitabine at a starting dose of 800 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan \nand bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 120 Patients \nwere randomised to a modified XELIRI regimen with capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily for two \nweeks followed by a 7-day rest period), irinotecan (200 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion on day 1 every \n3 weeks), and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks); 127 \npatients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for two weeks \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 as a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), \nand bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks).

In this trial, 627 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have received prior \ntreatment with irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine regimen as first line therapy were \nrandomised to treatment with XELOX or FOLFOX-4. For the dosing schedule of XELOX and \nFOLFOX-4 (without addition of placebo or bevacizumab), refer to table 6. XELOX was demonstrated \nto be non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 in terms of progression-free survival in the per-protocol population \nand intent-to-treat population (see table 9).

In this trial, 160 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2\n\n \n\ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2\n \nas a 2-hour infusion \n\nevery 3 weeks). A total of 156 patients were randomised to treatment with 5-FU (800 mg/m2\n \nper day, \n\ncontinuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2\n \nas a 2-hour infusion on day \n\n1, every 3 weeks). Capecitabine in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior to 5-FU in \ncombination with cisplatin in terms of progression-free survival in the per protocol analysis (hazard \nratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 - 1.04). The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (capecitabine + \ncisplatin) versus 5.0 months (5-FU + cisplatin). The hazard ratio for duration of survival (overall \nsurvival) was similar to the hazard ratio for progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI \n0.64 - 1.13). The median duration of survival was 10.5 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus \n9.3 months (5-FU + cisplatin). \n \nData from a randomised multicentre, phase III study comparing capecitabine to 5-FU and oxaliplatin \nto cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line \ntreatment of advanced gastric cancer (REAL-2). In this trial, 1002 patients were randomised in a 2x2 \nfactorial design to one of the following 4 arms: \n \n- ECF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) and 5-FU (200 mg/m2\n \ndaily given by continuous infusion \n\nvia a central line). \n- ECX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2\n \ntwice daily continuously).  \n\n- EOF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and 5-FU (200 mg/m2\n\n \ndaily given by continuous \n\ninfusion via a central line).  \n- EOX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \n\na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily \ncontinuously). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy analyses in the per protocol population demonstrated non-inferiority in overall \nsurvival for capecitabine vs. 5-FU-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.99) and for \noxaliplatin vs. cisplatin-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80 - 1.1). The median overall \nsurvival was 10.9 months in capecitabine-based regimens and 9.6 months in 5-FU based regimens. \nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months in cisplatin-based regimens and 10.4 months in \noxaliplatin-based regimens. \n \nCapecitabine has also been used in combination with oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric \ncancer. Studies with capecitabine monotherapy indicate that capecitabine has activity in advanced \ngastric cancer. \n \nColon, colorectal and advanced gastric cancer: meta-analysis \nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials (studies SO14695, SO14796, M66001, NO16966, NO16967, \nM17032) supports capecitabine replacing 5-FU in mono- and combination treatment in gastrointestinal \ncancer. The pooled analysis includes 3097 patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and \n3074 patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. Median overall survival time was 703 days \n(95% CI: 671; 745) in patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and 683 days (95% CI: \n646; 715) in patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. The hazard ratio for overall survival was \n0.94 (95% CI: 0.89; 1.00, p=0.0489) indicating that capecitabine-containing regimens are non-inferior \nto 5-FU-containing regimens. \n \nBreast cancer \n \nCombination therapy with capecitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with docetaxel for treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this \ntrial, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for \n\n2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period and docetaxel 75 mg/m2\n \nas a 1 hour intravenous infusion \n\nevery 3 weeks). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2\n \nas a \n\n1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel \ncombination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel combination arm (p<0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine after failure of taxanes, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, and \nfor whom anthracycline therapy is not indicated  \nData from two multicentre phase II clinical trials support the use of capecitabine monotherapy for \ntreatment of patients after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or \nfor whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In these trials, a total of 236 patients were \ntreated with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). The \n\noverall objective response rates (investigator assessment) were 20% (first trial) and 25% (second trial). \nThe median time to progression was 93 and 98 days. Median survival was 384 and 373 days. \n \nAll indications \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer), showed that patients on capecitabine who \ndeveloped hand-foot syndrome (HFS) had a longer overall survival compared to patients who did not \ndevelop HFS: median overall survival 1100 days (95% CI 1007; 1200) vs. 691 days (95% CI 638; \n754) with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.56; 0.66). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to conduct studies with the reference \nmedicinal product containing capecitabine in all subjects of the paediatric population in \nadenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, gastric adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of capecitabine have been evaluated over a dose range of 502-3514 mg/m2/day. \nThe parameters of capecitabine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine \n(5'-DFUR) measured on days 1 and 14 were similar. The AUC of 5-FU was 30%-35% higher on day \n14. Capecitabine dose reduction decreases systemic exposure to 5-FU more than dose-proportionally, \ndue to non-linear pharmacokinetics for the active metabolite. \n \nAbsorption  \nAfter oral administration, capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, followed by extensive \nconversion to the metabolites, 5'-DFCR and 5'-DFUR. Administration with food decreases the rate of \ncapecitabine absorption, but only results in a minor effect on the AUC of 5'-DFUR, and on the AUC of \nthe subsequent metabolite 5-FU. At the dose of 1250 mg/m2\n\n \non day 14 with administration after food \n\nintake, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax in μg/ml) for capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and \nFBAL were 4.67, 3.05, 12.1, 0.95 and 5.46 respectively. The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax \nin hours) were 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.00 and 3.34. The AUC0-∞ values in μg•h/ml were 7.75, 7.24, 24.6, \n2.03 and 36.3. \n \nDistribution  \nIn vitro human plasma studies have determined that capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR and 5-FU are \n54%, 10%, 62% and 10% protein bound, mainly to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation  \nCapecitabine is first metabolised by hepatic carboxylesterase to 5'-DFCR, which is then converted to \n5'-DFUR by cytidine deaminase, principally located in the liver and tumour tissues. Further catalytic \nactivation of 5'-DFUR then occurs by thymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase). The enzymes involved in \nthe catalytic activation are found in tumour tissues but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower \nlevels. The sequential enzymatic biotransformation of capecitabine to 5-FU leads to higher \nconcentrations within tumour tissues. In the case of colorectal tumours, 5-FU generation appears to be \nin large part localised in tumour stromal cells. Following oral administration of capecitabine to \npatients with colorectal cancer, the ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumours to adjacent \ntissues was 3.2 (ranged from 0.9 to 8.0). The ratio of 5-FU concentration in tumour to plasma was 21.4 \n(ranged from 3.9 to 59.9, n=8) whereas the ratio in healthy tissues to plasma was 8.9 (ranged from 3.0 \nto 25.8, n=8). Thymidine phosphorylase activity was measured and found to be 4 times greater in \nprimary colorectal tumour than in adjacent normal tissue. According to immunohistochemical studies, \nthymidine phosphorylase appears to be in large part localised in tumour stromal cells. \n \n5-FU is further catabolised by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to the much less \ntoxic dihydro-5-fluorouracil (FUH2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield \n5-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA). Finally, β-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to α-fluoro-β-\nalanine (FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity is the \nrate limiting step. Deficiency of DPD may lead to increased toxicity of capecitabine (see section 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life (t1/2 in hours) of capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL were \n0.85, 1.11, 0.66, 0.76 and 3.23 respectively. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly \nexcreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Faecal excretion is \nminimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL, which represents 57% of the \nadministered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged capecitabine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \nCombination therapy \nPhase I studies evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of either docetaxel or \npaclitaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel or \npaclitaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel or paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of \n5’-DFUR. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations  \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after capecitabine treatment of 505 patients \nwith colorectal cancer dosed at 1250 mg/m2\n\n \ntwice daily. Gender, presence or absence of liver \n\nmetastasis at baseline, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin, serum albumin, ASAT and \nALAT had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment due to liver metastases: According to a pharmacokinetic study in \ncancer patients with mild to moderate liver impairment due to liver metastases, the bioavailability of \ncapecitabine and exposure to 5-FU may increase compared to patients with no liver impairment. There \nare no pharmacokinetic data on patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: Based on a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to \nsevere renal impairment, there is no evidence for an effect of creatinine clearance on the \npharmacokinetics of intact drug and 5-FU. Creatinine clearance was found to influence the systemic \nexposure to 5’-DFUR (35% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%) and to \nFBAL (114% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%). FBAL is a metabolite \nwithout antiproliferative activity. \n \nElderly: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included patients with a wide range \nof ages (27 to 86 years) and included 234 (46%) patients greater or equal to 65, age has no influence \non the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR and 5-FU. The AUC of FBAL increased with age (20% increase \nin age results in a 15% increase in the AUC of FBAL). This increase is likely due to a change in renal \nfunction. \n \nEthnic factors: Following oral administration of 825 mg/m2\n\n \ncapecitabine twice daily for 14 days, \n\nJapanese patients (n=18) had about 36% lower Cmax and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than \nCaucasian patients (n=22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower Cmax and 34% lower AUC for \nFBAL than Caucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is unknown. No significant \ndifferences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, daily oral administration of capecitabine to cynomolgus monkeys and \nmice produced toxic effects on the gastrointestinal, lymphoid and haemopoietic systems, typical for \nfluoropyrimidines. These toxicities were reversible. Skin toxicity, characterised by \ndegenerative/regressive changes, was observed with capecitabine. Capecitabine was devoid of hepatic \nand CNS toxicities. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. PR- and QT-interval prolongation) was detectable in \ncynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration (100 mg/kg) but not after repeated oral dosing \n(1379 mg/m2/day). \n \nA two-year mouse carcinogenicity study produced no evidence of carcinogenicity by capecitabine. \n \nDuring standard fertility studies, impairment of fertility was observed in female mice receiving \ncapecitabine; however, this effect was reversible after a drug-free period. In addition, during a \n13-week study, atrophic and degenerative changes occurred in reproductive organs of male mice; \nhowever these effects were reversible after a drug-free period (see section 4.6). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nIn embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies in mice, dose-related increases in foetal resorption and \nteratogenicity were observed. In monkeys, abortion and embryolethality were observed at high doses, \nbut there was no evidence of teratogenicity. \n \nCapecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster \nV79/HPRT gene mutation assay). However, similar to other nucleoside analogues (ie, 5-FU), \ncapecitabine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes (in vitro) and a positive trend occurred in mouse \nbone marrow micronucleus tests (in vivo). \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Capecitabine SUN is and what it is used for \n \nCapecitabine SUN belongs to the group of medicines called \"cytostatic agents\", which stop the growth \nof cancer cells. Capecitabine SUN contains capecitabine, which itself is not a cytostatic agent. Only \nafter being absorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer agent (more in tumour tissue \nthan in normal tissue). \n \nCapecitabine SUN is used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers.  \nFurthermore, Capecitabine SUN is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete \nremoval of the tumour by surgery. \n \nCapecitabine SUN may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Capecitabine SUN \n \nDo not take Capecitabine SUN \n- if you are allergic to capecitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). You must inform your doctor if you know that you have an allergy to capecitabine. \n- if you previously have had severe reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy (a group of anticancer \n\nmedicines such as fluorouracil)  \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n- if you have severely low levels of white cells or platelets in the blood (leucopenia, neutropenia \n\nor thrombocytopenia) \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n- if you have a known deficiency for the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD),  \n\ninvolved in the metabolism of uracil and thymine, or \n- if you are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with brivudine, sorivudine \n\nor similar classes of substance as part of herpes zoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Capecitabine SUN, if you \n- have liver or kidney diseases \n- have or had heart problems (for example an irregular heartbeat or pains to the chest jaw and \n\nback brought on by physical effort and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart)  \n- have brain diseases (for example. cancer that has spread to the brain), or nerve damage \n\n(neuropathy)  \n- have calcium imbalances (seen in blood tests) \n- have diabetes \n- cannot keep food or water in your body because of severe nausea and vomiting \n- have diarrhoea \n- are, or become dehydrated \n- have imbalances of ions in your blood (electrolyte imbalances, seen in tests) \n- have a history of eye problems as you may need extra monitoring of your eyes \n- have a severe skin reaction. \n \nDPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a rare condition present at birth that is not usually associated with \nhealth problems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have an unrecognised DPD deficiency \nand take Capecitabine SUN, you may experience severe forms of the side effects listed under section 4 \nPossible side effects. Contact your doctor immediately if you are concerned about any of the side \neffects or if you notice any additional side effects not listed in the leaflet (see section 4 Possible side \neffects). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCapecitabine SUN is not indicated in children and adolescents. Do not give Capecitabine SUN to \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Capecitabine SUN \nBefore starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might \ntake any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is extremely \nimportant, as taking more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effect of \nthe medicines. You need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following: \n- gout medicines (allopurinol) \n- blood-thinning medicines (coumarin, warfarin) \n- certain anti-viral medicines (sorivudine and brivudine)  \n- medicines for seizures or tremors (phenytoin) \n- a medicine to treat cancer (interferon alpha)  \n- radiotherapy and certain medicines used to treat cancer (folinic acid, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, \n\ncisplatin, irinotecan) \n- medicines used to treat folic acid deficiency. \n \nCapecitabine SUN with food and drink \nYou should take Capecitabine SUN no later than 30 minutes after meals. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nBefore starting treatment, you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be \npregnant or if you intend to become pregnant. You must not take Capecitabine SUN if you are \npregnant or think you might be.  \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by patients who are taking Capecitabine SUN. \nYou must not breast-feed if you are taking Capecitabine SUN.  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCapecitabine SUN may make you feel dizzy, nauseous or tired. It is therefore possible that \nCapecitabine SUN could affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. Do not drive if you feel \ndizzy, nauseous or tired after taking this medicine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \nCapecitabine SUN contains anhydrous lactose \nThis medicine contains anhydrous lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Capecitabine SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines. \n \nCapecitabine SUN tablets should be swallowed whole with water, and within 30 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of \nCapecitabine SUN is based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and weight. \nThe usual dose for adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and \nevening). Two examples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m \nhas a body surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times \ndaily. A person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m2 \nand should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. \n \nCapecitabine SUN tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no \ntablets are taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. \n \nIn combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body \nsurface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no \nrest period). \n \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need to \ntake it. \n \nYour doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. \n- Take the tablets in the morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. \n- Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner). \n- It is important that you take all your medicines as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Capecitabine SUN than you should  \nContact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the next dose. \nYou might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling \nor being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the \nintestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. \n \nIf you forget to take Capecitabine SUN \nDo not take the missed dose at all and do not double the next one. Instead, continue your regular \ndosing schedule and check with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Capecitabine SUN \nThere are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with Capecitabine SUN. In case you are using \ncoumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping Capecitabine SUN might require \nthat your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSTOP taking Capecitabine SUN immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur: \n- Diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal \n\nbowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. \n- Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. \n- Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than \n\nusual. \n- Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat. \n- Hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or \n\nfeet. \n- Fever: if you have a temperature of 38°C or greater. \n- Infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. \n- Chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs \n\nduring exercise. \n- Steven-Johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and \n\nblisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in \nparticular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) \nand/or fever. \n\n \nIf caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after stopping treatment. If these \nside effects continue, contact your doctor immediately.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Capecitabine SUN is and what it is used for \n \nCapecitabine SUN belongs to the group of medicines called \"cytostatic agents\", which stop the growth \nof cancer cells. Capecitabine SUN contains capecitabine, which itself is not a cytostatic agent. Only \nafter being absorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer agent (more in tumour tissue \nthan in normal tissue). \n \nCapecitabine SUN is  used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers.  \nFurthermore, Capecitabine SUN is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete \nremoval of the tumour by surgery. \n \nCapecitabine SUN may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Capecitabine SUN \n \nDo not take Capecitabine SUN \n- if you are allergic to capecitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). You must inform your doctor if you know that you have an allergy to capecitabine. \n- if you previously have had severe reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy (a group of anticancer \n\nmedicines such as fluorouracil) \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n- if you have severely low levels of white cells or platelets in the blood (leucopenia, neutropenia \n\nor thrombocytopenia) \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n- if you have a known deficiency for the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD),  \n\ninvolved in the metabolism of uracil and thymine, or \n- if you are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with brivudine, sorivudine \n\nor similar classes of substance as part of herpes zoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Capecitabine SUN, if you \n- have liver or kidney diseases \n- have or had heart problems (for example an irregular heartbeat or pains to the chest jaw and \n\nback brought on by physical effort and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart)  \n- have brain diseases (for example. cancer that has spread to the brain), or nerve damage \n\n(neuropathy)  \n- have calcium imbalances (seen in blood tests) \n- have diabetes \n- cannot keep food or water in your body because of severe nausea and vomiting \n- have diarrhoea \n- are, or become dehydrated \n- have imbalances of ions in your blood (electrolyte imbalances, seen in tests) \n- have a history of eye problems as you may need extra monitoring of your eyes \n- have a severe skin reaction. \n \nDPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a rare condition present at birth that is not usually associated with \nhealth problems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have an unrecognised DPD deficiency \nand take Capecitabine SUN, you may experience severe forms of the side effects listed under section 4 \nPossible side effects. Contact your doctor immediately if you are concerned about any of the side \neffects or if you notice any additional side effects not listed in the leaflet (see section 4 Possible side \neffects). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCapecitabine SUN is not indicated in children and adolescents. Do not give Capecitabine SUN to \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Capecitabine SUN \nBefore starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might \ntake any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is extremely \nimportant, as taking more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the effect of \nthe medicines. You need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following: \n- gout medicines (allopurinol) \n- blood-thinning medicines (coumarin, warfarin) \n- certain anti-viral medicines (sorivudine and brivudine)  \n- medicines for seizures or tremors (phenytoin) \n- a medicine to treat cancer (interferon alpha)  \n- radiotherapy and certain medicines used to treat cancer (folinic acid, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, \n\ncisplatin, irinotecan) \n- medicines used to treat folic acid deficiency. \n \nCapecitabine SUN with food and drink  \nYou should take Capecitabine SUN no later than 30 minutes after meals. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nBefore starting treatment, you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be \npregnant or if you intend to become pregnant. You must not take Capecitabine SUN if you are \npregnant or think you might be.  \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by patients who are taking Capecitabine SUN. \nYou must not breast-feed if you are taking Capecitabine SUN.  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCapecitabine SUN may make you feel dizzy, nauseous or tired. It is therefore possible that \nCapecitabine SUN could affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. Do not drive if you feel \ndizzy, nauseous or tired after taking this medicine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \nCapecitabine SUN contains anhydrous lactose \nThis medicine contains anhydrous lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Capecitabine SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines. \n \nCapecitabine SUN tablets should be swallowed whole with water, and within 30 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of \nCapecitabine SUN is based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and weight. \nThe usual dose for adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and \nevening). Two examples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m \nhas a body surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times \ndaily. A person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m2 \nand should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. \n \nCapecitabine SUN tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no \ntablets are taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. \n \nIn combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body \nsurface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no \nrest period). \n \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need to \ntake it. \n \nYour doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. \n- Take the tablets in the morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. \n- Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner). \n- It is important that you take all your medicines as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Capecitabine SUN than you should  \nContact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the next dose. \nYou might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling \nor being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the \nintestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. \n \nIf you forget to take Capecitabine SUN \nDo not take the missed dose at all and do not double the next one. Instead, continue your regular \ndosing schedule and check with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Capecitabine SUN \nThere are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with Capecitabine SUN. In case you are using \ncoumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping Capecitabine SUN might require \nthat your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSTOP taking Capecitabine SUN immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur: \n- Diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal \n\nbowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. \n- Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. \n- Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than \n\nusual. \n- Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat. \n- Hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or \n\nfeet. \n- Fever: if you have a temperature of 38°C or greater. \n- Infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. \n- Chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs \n\nduring exercise. \n- Steven-Johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and \n\nblisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in \nparticular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) \nand/or fever. \n\n \nIf caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after stopping treatment. If these \nside effects continue, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may instruct you to restart \ntreatment at a lower dose. \n \nIn addition to the above, when Capecitabine SUN is used alone, very common side effects which may \naffect more than 1 person in 10 are: \n- abdominal pain \n- rash, dry or itchy skin \n- tiredness \n- loss of appetite (anorexia). \n \nThese side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor \nimmediately when you start to experience a side effect.
