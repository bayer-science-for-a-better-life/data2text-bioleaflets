CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nRevlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed \n\nmultiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nRevlimid as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, or melphalan and \n\nprednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple \n\nmyeloma who are not eligible for transplant. \n\n \n\nRevlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult \n\npatients who have received at least one prior therapy. \n\n \n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes \n\nRevlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia \n\ndue to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q \n\ncytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma \n\nRevlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle \n\ncell lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\nRevlimid in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients \n\nwith previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nRevlimid treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nFor all indications described below: \n\n• Dose is modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4). \n\n• Dose adjustments, during treatment and restart of treatment, are recommended to manage Grade 3 or \n4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to lenalidomide. \n\n• In case of neutropenia, the use of growth factors in patient management should be considered. \n\n• If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more than \n12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take the dose, \n\nbut take the next dose at the normal time on the following day.  \n \n\nPosology \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) \n\n• Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until disease progression in patients who are not \neligible for transplant \n\nLenalidomide treatment must not be started if the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is < 1.0 x 109/L, and/or \n\nplatelet counts are < 50 x 109/L. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose \n\nThe recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 21 of repeated \n\n28-day cycles. \n\nThe recommended dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg orally once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of repeated \n\n28-day cycles. Patients may continue lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy until disease progression or \n\nintolerance.  \n\n \n\n• Dose reduction steps \n\n Lenalidomidea Dexamethasonea \n\nStarting dose 25 mg 40 mg \n\nDose level -1 20 mg 20 mg \n\nDose level -2 15 mg 12 mg \n\nDose level -3 10 mg 8 mg \n\nDose level- 4 5 mg 4 mg \n\nDose level -5 2.5 mg Not applicable \nª Dose reduction for both products can be managed independently \n\n \n\n• Thrombocytopenia \n\nWhen platelets Recommended course \n\nFalls to < 25 x 109/L Stop lenalidomide dosing for remainder of cycleª \n\nReturns to ≥ 50 x 109/L Decrease by one dose level when dosing resumed \n\nat next cycle \n\nª If Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs on > day15 of a cycle, lenalidomide dosing will be interrupted for at least the remainder of the current 28-\nday cycle. \n \n\n• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) - neutropenia \n\nWhen ANC Recommended courseª \n\nFirst falls to < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 1 x 109/L when neutropenia is the only \n\nobserved toxicity \n\nResume lenalidomide at starting dose once daily \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L when dose-dependent \n\nhaematological toxicities other than neutropenia are \n\nobserved \n\nResume lenalidomide at dose level -1 once daily \n\nFor each subsequent drop below < 0.5 x 109/L Interrupt lenalidomide treatment \n\nReturns to ≥ 0.5 x 109/L Resume lenalidomide at next lower dose level \n\nonce daily.  \na At the physician’s discretion, if neutropenia is the only toxicity at any dose level, add granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and maintain \n\nthe dose level of lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor hematologic toxicity the dose of lenalidomide may be re-introduced to the next higher dose level (up to \n\nthe starting dose) upon improvement in bone marrow function (no hematologic toxicity for at least 2 \n\nconsecutive cycles: ANC ≥1,5 x 109/L with a platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L at the beginning of a new cycle). \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \n\n• Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone until disease progression in patients who are not eligible for transplant \n\nInitial treatment: Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nLenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone must not be started if the ANC is \n\n< 1.0 x 109/L, and/or platelet counts are < 50 x 109/L.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is lenalidomide 25 mg orally once daily days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle in \n\ncombination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Bortezomib should be administered via subcutaneous \n\ninjection (1.3 mg/m2 body surface area) twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of each 21-day.

To monitor for TLS, patients should have a chemistry panel drawn weekly during the \n\nfirst cycle and as clinically indicated. \n\nLenalidomide may be continued (maintain dose) in patients with laboratory TLS or Grade 1 clinical TLS, or \n\nat the physician’s discretion, reduce dose by one level and continue lenalidomide. Vigorous intravenous \n\nhydration should be provided and appropriate medical management according to the local standard of care, \n\nuntil correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Rasburicase therapy may be needed to reduce hyperuricaemia. \n\nHospitalisation of the patient will be at physician’s discretion. \n\nIn patients with Grade 2 to 4 clinical TLS, interrupt lenalidomide and obtain a chemistry panel weekly or as \n\nclinically indicated. Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical \n\nmanagement according to the local standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. \n\nRasburicase therapy and hospitalisation will be at physician’s discretion. When the TLS resolves to Grade 0, \n\nrestart lenalidomide at next lower dose per physician’s discretion (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTumour flare reaction \n\nAt the physician’s discretion, lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 or 2 tumour flare \n\nreaction (TFR) without interruption or modification. At the physician’s discretion, therapy with non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), limited duration corticosteroids, and/or narcotic analgesics may be \n\nadministered. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, withhold treatment with lenalidomide and initiate therapy \n\nwith NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or narcotic analgesics. When TFR resolves to ≤ Grade 1, restart \n\nlenalidomide treatment at the same dose level for the rest of the cycle. Patients may be treated for \n\nmanagement of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAll indications \n\nFor other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, treatment should be stopped and only \n\nrestarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 depending on the physician’s \n\ndiscretion. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Lenalidomide \n\nmust be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and \n\nSystemic Symptoms (DRESS) is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation from these \n\nreactions. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n• Paediatric population \nRevlimid should not be used in children and adolescents from birth to less than 18 years because of safety \n\nconcerns (see section 5.1).  \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n \n\n• Elderly \nCurrently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2. Lenalidomide has been used in clinical \n\ntrials in multiple myeloma patients up to 91 years of age, in myelodysplastic syndromes patients up to \n\n95 years of age and in mantle cell lymphoma patients up to 88 years of age (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nBecause elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose \n\nselection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant \n\nPatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed \n\nbefore treatment is considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor patients older than 75 years of age treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, the \n\nstarting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycle. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is proposed for patients older than 75 years who are treated with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone. \n\n \n\nIn patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older who received lenalidomide, \n\nthere was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide combined therapy was less tolerated in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients older than \n\n75 years of age compared to the younger population. These patients discontinued at a higher rate due to \n\nintolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events), when compared to patients < 75 years. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy  \n\nThe percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between the \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety or efficacy \n\nwas observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of older individuals \n\ncannot be ruled out.  \n\n \n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes \n\nFor myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and \n\nefficacy was observed between patients aged over 65 and younger patients. \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma \n\nFor mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and efficacy \n\nwas observed between patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients aged under 65 years of age.  \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\nFor follicular lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, the overall rate of \n\nadverse events is similar for patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients under 65 years of age. No \n\noverall difference in efficacy was observed between the two age groups. \n\n \n\n• Patients with renal impairment \nLenalidomide is primarily excreted by the kidney; patients with greater degrees of renal impairment can have \n\nimpaired treatment tolerance (see section 4.4).

The capsules should \n\nnot be opened, broken or chewed. The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, either \n\nwith or without food. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby reducing the \n\nrisk of capsule deformation or breakage. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n• Women who are pregnant.  \n\n• Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme \nare met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen lenalidomide is given in combination with other medicinal products, the corresponding \n\nSummary of Product Characteristics must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy warning \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Lenalidomide induced in monkeys’ malformations \n\nsimilar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is taken during \n\npregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. \n\n \n\nThe conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is \n\nreliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. \n\n \n\nCriteria for women of non-childbearing potential \n\nA female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she \n\nmeets at least one of the following criteria: \n\n• Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy or \nduring breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). \n\n• Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n• Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy \n\n• XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. \n \n\nCounselling \n\nFor women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met: \n\n• She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child \n\n• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks before \nstarting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the end of \n\ntreatment \n\n• Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on effective \ncontraception \n\n• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures \n\n• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly \nconsult if there is a risk of pregnancy \n\n• She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed following a \nnegative pregnancy test \n\n• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks except in \ncase of confirmed tubal sterilisation \n\n• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use \nof lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is present in \n\nhuman semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human semen 3 days after \n\nstopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and taking into account \n\nspecial populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male patients taking \n\nlenalidomide must meet the following conditions: \n\n• Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a \nwoman of childbearing potential \n\n• Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a \nwoman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man has had a \n\nvasectomy), during treatment and for at least 7 days after dose interruptions and/or cessation of \n\ntreatment. \n\n• Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking Revlimid or shortly after he \nhas stopped taking Revlimid, he should inform his treating physician immediately and that it is \n\nrecommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for \n\nevaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nThe prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: \n\n• The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including \nconfirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding \n\n• The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. \n \n\nContraception \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks \n\nbefore therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after lenalidomide therapy and even in case of dose \n\ninterruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. \n\nIf not established on effective contraception, the patient must be referred to an appropriately trained health \n\ncare professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be initiated.  \n\n \n\nThe following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: \n\n• Implant \n\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) \n\n• Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot \n\n• Tubal sterilisation \n\n• Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two \nnegative semen analyses \n\n• Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \n\nBecause of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking \n\nlenalidomide in combination therapy, and to a lesser extent in patients with multiple myeloma, \n\nmyelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma taking lenalidomide monotherapy, combined oral \n\ncontraceptive pills are not recommended (see also section 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral \n\ncontraception the patient should switch to one of the effective methods listed above. The risk of venous \n\nthromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of \n\ncontraceptive steroids may be reduced during co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nImplants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of infection \n\nat the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered \n\nparticularly in patients with neutropenia. \n\n \n\nCopper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of infection \n\nat the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with neutropenia or \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nPregnancy testing \n\nAccording to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL \n\nmust be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This requirement includes women \n\nof childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing \n\na prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of \n\nchildbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription. \n\n \n\nPrior to starting treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when lenalidomide is \n\nprescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using effective \n\ncontraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts \n\ntreatment with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFollow-up and end of treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least 4 weeks \n\nafter the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy tests should be \n\nperformed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. \n\n \n\nAdditional precautions \n\nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused \n\ncapsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment for safe disposal. \n\n \n\nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 7 days following discontinuation of \n\nlenalidomide. \n\n \n\nHealthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or capsule. \n\nWomen who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule (see \n\nsection 6.6). \n\n \n\nEducational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions \n\nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the marketing authorisation holder will \n\nprovide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about the expected \n\nteratogenicity of lenalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before therapy is started, and to provide \n\nguidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform male and female patients about the \n\nexpected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy \n\nPrevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational brochure, patient card \n\nand/or equivalent tool in accordance to the national implemented patient card system. A national controlled \n\ndistribution system has been implemented in collaboration with each National Competent Authority. The \n\ncontrolled distribution system includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or \n\ndispensing controls, and the collecting of detailed data relating to the indication in order to monitor closely \n\nthe off-label use within the national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and \n\n\n\n 16 \n\ndispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential \n\nshould occur within 7 days of the prescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test \n\nresult. Prescriptions for women of childbearing potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of \n\n4 weeks according to the approved indications dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all \n\nother patients can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nOther special warnings and precautions for use \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nMyocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with known \n\nrisk factors and within the first 12 months when used in combination with dexamethasone. Patients with \n\nknown risk factors – including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored, and action should be taken to \n\ntry to minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). \n\n \n\nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated with \n\nan increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary \n\nembolism). The risk of venous thromboembolism was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone.  \n\n \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma, treatment with \n\nlenalidomide monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly \n\ndeep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination therapy (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated with \n\nan increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular \n\nevent) and was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. The \n\nrisk of arterial thromboembolism is lower in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide \n\nmonotherapy than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide in combination therapy. \n\n \n\nConsequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – should \n\nbe closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, \n\nhypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history \n\nof thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. Therefore, erythropoietic \n\nagents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, \n\nshould be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone. A \n\nhaemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. \n\n \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, \n\nchest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines should be recommended, especially \n\nin patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take antithrombotic prophylactic measures \n\nshould be made after careful assessment of an individual patient’s underlying risk factors. \n\n \n\nIf the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard \n\nanticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment and any \n\ncomplications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment may be restarted \n\nat the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should continue anticoagulation \n\ntherapy during the course of lenalidomide treatment. \n\n \n\nPulmonary hypertension \n\nCases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide. \n\nPatients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to \n\ninitiating and during lenalidomide therapy. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\nThe major dose limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A complete \n\nblood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, haemoglobin, and \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nhaematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of lenalidomide treatment and \n\nmonthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. In mantle cell lymphoma patients, the monitoring scheme \n\nshould be every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4, and then at the start of each cycle. In follicular lymphoma, the \n\nmonitoring scheme should be weekly for the first 3 weeks of cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles \n\n2 through 4, and then at the start of each cycle thereafter. A dose interruption and/or a dose reduction may be \n\nrequired (see section 4.2).  \n\nIn case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management. \n\nPatients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes.  \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae \n\nand epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to induce bleeding \n\n(see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). \n\nCo-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with caution. \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide \nmaintenance \n\nThe adverse reactions from CALGB 100104 included events reported post-high dose melphalan and ASCT \n\n(HDM/ASCT) as well as events from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis identified events \n\nthat occurred after the start of maintenance treatment. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions were from the \n\nmaintenance treatment period only. \n\n \n\nOverall, Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance arms \n\ncompared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in NDMM \n\npatients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance \n\ntreatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs \n\nof neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 \n\nand 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar \n\nfrequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies \n\n(0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% \n\nin IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment \n\ninterruption and/or dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance arms \n\ncompared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in NDMM \n\npatients who have undergone ASCT (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of maintenance \n\ntreatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients and physicians are \n\nadvised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae and epistaxes, especially in \n\npatients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to induce bleeding (see section 4.8, \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders). \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed at a lower frequency in the lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib \n\nand dexamethasone (RVd) arm compared to the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs 5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 \n\nstudy. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd arm and Rd arm (0.0% vs \n\n0.4%). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes; a treatment interruption and/or dose \n\nreduction may be required (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the RVd arm compared to the Rd \n\ncomparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed in the lenalidomide arms in combination with dexamethasone to a lesser \n\nextent than in the comparator arm (8.5% in the Rd [continuous treatment] and Rd18 [treatment for 18 four-\n\nweek cycles] compared with 15% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section 4.8). Grade 4 \n\nfebrile neutropenia episodes were consistent with the comparator arm (0.6 % in the Rd and Rd18 \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.7% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide \n\narm, see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed to a lesser extent in the Rd and Rd18 arms than in the \n\ncomparator arm (8.1% vs 11.1%, respectively).  \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in clinical trials of newly diagnosed \n\nmultiple myeloma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in \n\nmelphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide arm followed by lenalidomide [MPR+R] and melphalan, prednisone \n\nand lenalidomide followed by placebo [MPR+p] treated patients compared with 7.8% in MPp+p-treated \n\npatients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (1.7% in \n\nMPR+R/MPR+p treated patients compared to 0.0% in MPp+p treated patients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients is associated \n\nwith a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in MPR+R/MPR+p treated \n\npatients, compared with 13.7% in MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n• Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients with at least one prior \n\ntherapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-\n\ntreated patients compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 \n\nfebrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated \n\npatients compared to 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone treated patients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a \n\nhigher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated \n\npatients; see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n• Myelodysplastic syndromes \nLenalidomide treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes patients is associated with a higher incidence of \n\nGrade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared to patients on placebo (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n• Mantle cell lymphoma \nLenalidomide treatment in mantle cell lymphoma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 \n\nand 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the control arm (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n• Follicular lymphoma \nThe combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients is associated with a higher \n\nincidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the placebo/rituximab arm. Febrile \n\nneutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia were more commonly observed in the lenalidomide/ \n\nrituximab arm (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nThyroid disorders \n\nCases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid \n\nconditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing \n\nmonitoring of thyroid function is recommended. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral neuropathy.  \n\nThere was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with lenalidomide in combination with \n\ndexamethasone or melphalan and prednisone or lenalidomide monotherapy or with long term use of \n\nlenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma \n\npatients is associated with a higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy. The frequency was lower when \n\nbortezomib was administered subcutaneously. For additional information, see Section 4.8 and the SmPC for \n\nbortezomib. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \n\nTumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome \n\nBecause lenalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity the complications of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) may \n\noccur. TLS and tumour flare reaction (TFR) have commonly been observed in patients with chronic \n\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and uncommonly in patients with lymphomas, who were treated with \n\nlenalidomide. Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. The patients at \n\nrisk of TLS and TFR are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. Caution should be practiced when \n\nintroducing these patients to lenalidomide. These patients should be monitored closely, especially during the \n\nfirst cycle or dose-escalation, and appropriate precautions taken. There have been rare reports of TLS in \n\npatients with MM treated with lenalidomide, and no reports in patients with MDS treated with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\n• Mantle cell lymphoma \nCareful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Patients with high mantle cell lymphoma \n\nInternational Prognostic Index (MIPI) at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the \n\nlongest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. Tumour flare reaction may mimic progression of disease \n\n(PD). Patients in studies MCL-002 and MCL-001 that experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with \n\ncorticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take \n\ntherapeutic measures for TFR should be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n• Follicular lymphoma  \nCareful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients who \n\nexperienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for \n\nmanagement of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after \n\ncareful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended.  Patients should be well hydrated and receive \n\nTLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or longer, as clinically \n\nindicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nTumour burden  \n\n• Mantle cell lymphoma \nLenalidomide is not recommended for the treatment of patients with high tumour burden if alternative \n\ntreatment options are available.  \n\n \n\nEarly death \n\nIn study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients with \n\nhigh tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, there were 16/81 (20%) early deaths in \n\nthe lenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7%) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding figures \n\nwere 32/81 (40%) and 6/28 (21%) (See section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nAdverse events \n\nIn study MCL-002, during treatment cycle 1, 11/81 (14%) patients with high tumour burden were withdrawn \n\nfrom therapy in the lenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4%) in the control group. The main reason for treatment \n\nwithdrawal for patients with high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was \n\nadverse events, 7/11 (64%).  \n\nPatients with high tumour burden should therefore be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see Section \n\n4.8) including signs of tumour flare reaction (TFR). Please refer to section 4.2 for dose adjustments for TFR. \n\nHigh tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions ≥3 cm.  \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\nCases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions \n\nincluding SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide (see section 4.8). \n\nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and should be \n\ntold to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. Lenalidomide must be \n\ndiscontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is \n\nsuspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions. Interruption or \n\ndiscontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for other forms of skin reaction depending on severity. \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nPatients who had previous allergic reactions while treated with thalidomide should be monitored closely, as a \n\npossible cross-reaction between lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients \n\nwith a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance \n\nRevlimid capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies \n\nAn increase of second primary malignancies (SPM) has been observed in clinical trials in previously treated \n\nmyeloma patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years) compared to controls \n\n(1.38 per 100 person-years). Non-invasive SPM comprise basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. Most of \n\nthe invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for transplant, a 4.9-fold increase \n\nin incidence rate of hematologic SPM (cases of AML, MDS) has been observed in patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 person-years) \n\ncompared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.36 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nA 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide (9 cycles) in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-years) \n\ncompared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.74 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months, \n\nthe hematologic SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased as compared to \n\nthalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years).  \n\n \n\nA 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving \n\nlenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months (1.58 per 100 person-\n\nyears) compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100 person-years). \n\n \n\nIn newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone, the hematologic SPM incidence rate was 0.00 – 0.16 per 100 person-years and the incidence \n\nrate of solid tumour SPM was 0.21 – 1.04 per 100 person-years. \n\n \n\nThe increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in the \n\ncontext of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it should be \n\nkept in mind when considering and using Revlimid in this setting. \n\n \n\nThe incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies \n\n(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 per 100 \n\nperson-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after \n\nASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT). The incidence \n\nrate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 1.05 per 100 person-\n\nyears for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and \n\n0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT).   \n\n \n\nThe risk of occurrence of hematologic SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment with \n\nlenalidomide either in combination with melphalan or immediately following high-dose melphalan and \n\nASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using standard cancer \n\nscreening for occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated. \n\n \n\nProgression to acute myeloid leukaemia in low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS \n\n• Karyotype \nBaseline variables including complex cytogenetics are associated with progression to AML in subjects who \n\nare transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality. In a combined analysis of two clinical trials of \n\nlenalidomide in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, subjects who had a complex \n\ncytogenetics had the highest estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML (38.6%). The estimated \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n2-year rate of progression to AML in patients with an isolated Del (5q) abnormality was 13.8%, compared to \n\n17.3% for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic abnormality. \n\n \n\nAs a consequence, the benefit/risk ratio of lenalidomide when MDS is associated with Del (5q) and complex \n\ncytogenetics is unknown.  \n\n \n\n• TP53 status \nA TP53 mutation is present in 20 to 25% of lower-risk MDS Del 5q patients and is associated with a higher \n\nrisk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of \n\nlenalidomide in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS-004), the estimated 2-year \n\nrate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity (1% cut-off level of strong \n\nnuclear staining, using immunohistochemical assessment of p53 protein as a surrogate for TP53 mutation \n\nstatus) and 3.6% in patients with IHC-p53 negativity (p=0.0038) (see section 4.8) \n\n \n\nProgression to other malignancies in mantle cell lymphoma \n\nIn mantle cell lymphoma, AML, B-cell malignancies and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are identified \n\nrisks. \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies in follicular lymphoma \n\nIn a relapsed/refractory iNHL study which included follicular lymphoma patients, no increased risk of SPMs \n\nin the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to the placebo/rituximab arm, was observed. Hematologic SPM \n\nof AML occurred in 0.29 per 100 person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with 0.29 per \n\n100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab. The incidence rate of hematologic plus solid \n\ntumour SPMs (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) was 0.87 per 100 person-years in the \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to 1.17 per 100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab \n\nwith a median follow-up of 30.59 months (range 0.6 to 50.9 months).  \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancers are identified risks and comprise squamous cell carcinomas of skin or basal cell \n\ncarcinomas. \n\n \n\nPhysicians should monitor patients for the development of SPMs. Both the potential benefit of lenalidomide \n\nand the risk of SPMs should be considered when considering treatment with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\nHepatic failure, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination \n\ntherapy: acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and mixed \n\ncytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis have been reported. The mechanisms of severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity \n\nremain unknown although, in some cases, pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, \n\nand possibly treatment with antibiotics might be risk factors. \n\n \n\nAbnormal liver function tests were commonly reported and were generally asymptomatic and reversible \n\nupon dosing interruption. Once parameters have returned to baseline, treatment at a lower dose may be \n\nconsidered.  \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is excreted by the kidneys. It is important to dose adjust patients with renal impairment in \n\norder to avoid plasma levels which may increase the risk for higher haematological adverse reactions or \n\nhepatotoxicity. Monitoring of liver function is recommended, particularly when there is a history of or \n\nconcurrent viral liver infection or when lenalidomide is combined with medicinal products known to be \n\nassociated with liver dysfunction. \n\n \n\nInfection with or without neutropenia \n\nPatients with multiple myeloma are prone to develop infections including pneumonia. A higher rate of \n\ninfections was observed with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone than with MPT in patients \n\nwith NDMM who are not eligible for transplant, and with lenalidomide maintenance compared to placebo in \n\npatients with NDMM who had undergone ASCT. Grade ≥ 3 infections occurred within the context of \n\nneutropenia in less than one-third of the patients. Patients with known risk factors for infections should be \n\nclosely monitored. All patients should be advised to seek medical attention promptly at the first sign of \n\ninfection (eg, cough, fever, etc) thereby allowing for early management to reduce severity. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \n\nViral reactivation \n\nCases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, including serious cases of \n\nherpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of viral reactivation had a fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, meningitis herpes \n\nzoster or ophthalmic herpes zoster requiring a temporary hold or permanent discontinuation of the treatment \n\nwith lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving lenalidomide who have previously \n\nbeen infected with the hepatitis B virus. Some of these cases have progressed to acute hepatic failure \n\nresulting in discontinuation of lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. Hepatitis B virus status should \n\nbe established before initiating treatment with lenalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV \n\ninfection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n\nCaution should be exercised when lenalidomide is used in patients previously infected with HBV, including \n\npatients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. These patients should be closely monitored for \n\nsigns and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported with \n\nlenalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with \n\nlenalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or prior \n\ntreatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at regular \n\nintervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening \n\nneurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also be advised to \n\ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is \n\nnot aware of. \n\n \n\nThe evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the \n\nbrain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a \n\nbrain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-up and \n\nevaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  \n\n \n\nIf PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, \n\nlenalidomide must be permanently discontinued. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients \n\nThere was a higher rate of intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, discontinuation) \n\nin patients with age > 75 years, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60 mL/min when lenalidomide is given \n\nin combination. Patients should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate lenalidomide in \n\ncombination, with consideration to age, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60 mL/min (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.8). \n\n \n\nCataract \n\nCataract has been reported with a higher frequency in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with \n\ndexamethasone particularly when used for a prolonged time. Regular monitoring of visual ability is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nErythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement \n\ntherapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with \n\ndexamethasone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nNo interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Lenalidomide is not an enzyme inducer. In \n\nan in vitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, at various concentrations tested did not induce \n\nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leading to reduced efficacy of \n\nmedicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is not expected if lenalidomide is administered \n\nalone. However, dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also \n\naffect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives \n\nmay be reduced during treatment. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy must be taken (see sections 4.4 and \n\n4.6). \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nCo-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose \n\npharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no effect \n\non the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an interaction during \n\nclinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak to moderate enzyme \n\ninducer and its effect on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin concentration is advised during \n\nthe treatment. \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n\nConcomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of digoxin \n\n(0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52%-28.2%]. It is not known whether \n\nthe effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and concomitant treatment with \n\ndexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring of the digoxin concentration is advised during lenalidomide \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nStatins \n\nThere is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when statins are administered with lenalidomide, which may be \n\nsimply additive. Enhanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is warranted notably during the first weeks of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nDexamethasone \n\nCo-administration of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone (40 mg once daily) has no clinically relevant \n\neffect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily). \n\n \n\nInteractions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors \n\nIn vitro, lenalidomide is a substrate of P-gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple doses \n\nof the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P-gp inhibitor/substrate \n\ntemsirolimus (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg). \n\nCo-administration of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nDue to the teratogenic potential, lenalidomide must be prescribed under a Pregnancy Prevention Programme \n\n(see section 4.4) unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in a \n\nwoman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a \n\nphysician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a partner \n\nof a male patient taking lenalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician \n\nspecialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in \n\nhuman semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution, \n\nand taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all \n\nmale patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration, during dose \n\ninterruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of childbearing \n\npotential and has no contraception. \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nLenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide induced malformation in monkeys similar to those described with thalidomide (see \n\nsection 5.3). Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is contraindicated \n\nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding should be \n\ndiscontinued during therapy with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nA fertility study in rats with lenalidomide doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 to 500 times the human \n\ndoses of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on body surface area) produced no adverse effects on fertility \n\nand no parental toxicity. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLenalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, \n\nsomnolence, vertigo and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. Therefore, caution \n\nis recommended when driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance \n\nA conservative approach was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The adverse \n\nreactions described in Table 1 included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events from the \n\nmaintenance treatment period. A second analysis that identified events that occurred after the start of \n\nmaintenance treatment suggests that the frequencies described in Table 1 may be higher than actually \n\nobserved during the maintenance treatment period. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions were from the \n\nmaintenance treatment period only. \n\n \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide maintenance than placebo \n\nwere: \n\n• Pneumonia (10.6%; combined term) from IFM 2005-02 \n\n• Lung infection (9.4% [9.4% after the start of maintenance treatment]) from CALGB 100104 \n \n\nIn the IFM 2005-02 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide maintenance \n\nthan placebo were neutropenia (60.8%), bronchitis (47.4%), diarrhoea (38.9%), nasopharyngitis (34.8%), \n\nmuscle spasms (33.4%), leucopenia (31.7%), asthenia (29.7%), cough (27.3%), thrombocytopenia (23.5%), \n\ngastroenteritis (22.5%) and pyrexia (20.5%). \n\n \n\nIn the CALGB 100104 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide \n\nmaintenance than placebo were neutropenia (79.0% [71.9% after the start of maintenance treatment]), \n\nthrombocytopenia (72.3% [61.6%]), diarrhoea (54.5% [46.4%]), rash (31.7% [25.0%]), upper respiratory \n\ntract infection (26.8% [26.8%]), fatigue (22.8% [17.9%]), leucopenia (22.8% [18.8%]) and anaemia (21.0% \n\n[13.8%]). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nIn the SWOG S0777 study, the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with lenalidomide \n\nin combination with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with \n\ndexamethasone were:  \n\n• Hypotension (6.5%), lung infection (5.7%), dehydration (5.0%) \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were: Fatigue (73.7%), \n\nperipheral neuropathy (71.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.6%), constipation (56.1%), hypocalcaemia (50.0%).  \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with low dose dexamethasone \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide in combination with low \n\ndose dexamethasone (Rd and Rd18) than with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) were: \n\n• Pneumonia (9.8%) \n\n• Renal failure (including acute) (6.3%) \n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with Rd or Rd18 than MPT were: diarrhoea (45.5%), fatigue \n\n(32.8%), back pain (32.0%), asthenia (28.2%), insomnia (27.6%), rash (24.3%), decreased appetite (23.1%), \n\ncough (22.7%), pyrexia (21.4%), and muscle spasms (20.5%). \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with lenalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide \n\nfollowed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR+R) or melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide followed by \n\nplacebo (MPR+p) than melphalan, prednisone and placebo followed by placebo (MPp+p) were: \n\n• Febrile neutropenia (6.0%) \n\n• Anaemia (5.3%) \n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed more frequently with MPR+R or MPR+p than MPp+p were: neutropenia \n\n(83.3%), anaemia (70.7%), thrombocytopenia (70.0%), leucopenia (38.8%), constipation (34.0%), diarrhoea \n\n(33.3%), rash (28.9%), pyrexia (27.0%), peripheral oedema (25.0%), cough (24.0%), decreased appetite \n\n(23.7%), and asthenia (22.0%). \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \n\nIn two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 351 to the placebo/dexamethasone combination.  \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in lenalidomide/dexamethasone than \n\nplacebo/dexamethasone combination were: \n\n• Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) \n\n• Grade 4 neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n \n\nThe observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently with lenalidomide and dexamethasone than \n\nplacebo and dexamethasone in pooled multiple myeloma clinical trials (MM-009 and MM-010) were fatigue \n\n(43.9%), neutropenia (42.2%), constipation (40.5%), diarrhoea (38.5%), muscle cramp (33.4%), anaemia \n\n(31.4%), thrombocytopenia (21.5%), and rash (21.2%). \n\n \n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes \n\nThe overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is based on data from \n\na total of 286 patients from one phase 2 study and one phase 3 study (see section 5.1). In the phase 2, all 148 \n\npatients were on lenalidomide treatment. In the phase 3 study, 69 patients were on lenalidomide 5 mg, 69 \n\npatients on lenalidomide 10 mg and 67 patients were on placebo during the double-blind phase of the study.  \n\n \n\nMost adverse reactions tended to occur during the first 16 weeks of therapy with lenalidomide. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions include: \n\n• Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) \n\n• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide groups \n\ncompared to the control arm in the phase 3 study were neutropenia (76.8%), thrombocytopenia (46.4%), \n\n\n\n 26 \n\ndiarrhoea (34.8%), constipation (19.6%), nausea (19.6%), pruritus (25.4%), rash (18.1%), fatigue (18.1%) \n\nand muscle spasms (16.7%). \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma \n\nThe overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with mantle cell lymphoma is based on data from 254 \n\npatients from a phase 2 randomised, controlled study MCL-002 (see section 5.1).  \n\nAdditionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study MCL-001 have been included in table 3. \n\n \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in study MCL-002 (with a difference of at least 2 \n\npercentage points) in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm were: \n\n• Neutropenia (3.6%) \n\n• Pulmonary embolism (3.6%) \n\n• Diarrhoea (3.6%) \n \n\nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide arm \n\ncompared with the control arm in study MCL-002 were neutropenia (50.9%), anaemia (28.7%), diarrhoea \n\n(22.8%), fatigue (21.0%), constipation (17.4%), pyrexia (16.8%), and rash (including dermatitis allergic) \n\n(16.2%).  \n\n \n\nIn study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients with \n\nhigh tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, 16/81 (20%) early deaths in the \n\nlenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7%) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding figures \n\nwere 32/81 (39.5%) and 6/28 (21%) (see section 5.1).  \n\nDuring treatment cycle 1, 11/81 (14%) patients with high tumour burden were withdrawn from therapy in the \n\nlenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4%) in the control group. The main reason for treatment withdrawal for patients \n\nwith high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was adverse events, 7/11 (64%).  \n\nHigh tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions ≥3 cm. \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma  \n\nThe overall safety profile of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with previously treated \n\nfollicular lymphoma is based on data from 294 patients from a Phase 3 randomised, controlled study NHL-\n\n007. Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study NHL-008 have been included in Table 5. \n\n \n\nThe serious adverse reactions observed most frequently (with a difference of at least 1 percentage point) in \n\nstudy NHL-007 in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm were: \n\n• Febrile neutropenia (2.7%) \n\n• Pulmonary embolism (2.7%) \n\n• Pneumonia (2.7%) \n \n\nIn the NHL-007 study the adverse reactions observed more frequently in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm \n\ncompared with the placebo/rituximab arm (with at least 2% higher frequency between arms) were \n\nneutropenia (58.2%), diarrhoea (30.8%), leucopenia (28.8%), constipation (21.9%), cough (21.9%)  and \n\nfatigue (21.9%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide are listed below by system organ class \n\nand frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions have been included under the appropriate category in the table below according to the \n\nhighest frequency observed in any of the main clinical trials. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary for monotherapy in MM \n\nThe following table is derived from data gathered during NDMM studies in patients who have undergone \n\nASCT treated with lenalidomide maintenance.

Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys, lenalidomide induced malformations \n\nsimilar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is taken during \n\npregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide \nmaintenance \n\nLenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia \n\ncompared to placebo maintenance (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance treatment] \n\nin CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs of \n\nneutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 \n\nand 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar \n\nfrequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n(0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% \n\nin IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\n \n\nLenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 \n\nthrombocytopenia compared to placebo maintenance (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of \n\nmaintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving \nlenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nGrade 4 neutropenia was observed in the RVd arm to a lesser extent than in the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs \n\n5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd \n\narm compared to the Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%).  \n\n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in the RVd arm to a greater extent than in the Rd comparator \n\narm (17.2 % vs 9.4%). \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients is \n\nassociated with a lower frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (8.5% in Rd and Rd18, compared with MPT \n\n(15%). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (0.6% in Rd and Rd18 compared with 0.7% in \n\nMPT). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients is \n\nassociated with a lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (8.1% in Rd and Rd18) compared \n\nwith MPT (11.1%). \n\n \n\n• Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with \nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma \n\npatients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in MPR+R/MPR+p) compared \n\nwith MPp+p (7.8%). There was a higher frequency of Grade 4 febrile neutropenia observed (1.7% in \n\nMPR+R/MPR+p compared to 0.0% in MPp+p).  \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma \n\npatients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in \n\nMPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (13.7%).  \n\n \n\n• Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy \nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a \n\nhigher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared \n\nwith 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed \n\ninfrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% in \n\nplacebo/dexamethasone treated patients). \n\n \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with a \n\nhigher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in \n\nlenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated \n\npatients). \n\n \n\n• Myelodysplastic syndromes patients \nIn myelodysplastic syndromes patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 \n\nneutropenia (74.6% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 14.9% in patients on placebo in the \n\nphase 3 study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 2.2% of lenalidomide-treated \n\npatients compared with 0.0% in patients on placebo). Lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of \n\nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (37% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 1.5% in patients on \n\nplacebo in the phase 3 study). \n\n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n• Mantle cell lymphoma patients \nIn mantle cell lymphoma patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 \n\nneutropenia (43.7% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 33.7% in patients in the control arm in \n\nthe phase 2 study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 6.0% of lenalidomide-treated \n\npatients compared with 2.4% in patients on control arm.  \n\n \n\n• Follicular lymphoma patients \nThe combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma is associated with a higher rate of \n\ngrade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (50.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared with 12.2% in \n\nplacebo/rituximab treated patients). All grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were reversible through dose interruption, \n\nreduction and/or supportive care with growth factors. Additionally, febrile neutropenia was observed \n\ninfrequently (2.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared with 0.7% in placebo/rituximab \n\ntreated patients).   \n\n \n\nLenalidomide in combination with rituximab is also associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or \n\n4 thrombocytopenia (1.4% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared to 0% in placebo/rituximab \n\npatients).  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n\nAn increased risk of DVT and PE is associated with the use of the combination of lenalidomide with \n\ndexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, and to a lesser extent in patients treated with \n\nlenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or in patients with multiple myeloma, \n\nmyelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy (see \n\nsection 4.5).  \n\nConcomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of DVT may also increase \n\nthrombotic risk in these patients. \n\n \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nMyocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with known \n\nrisk factors. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders are listed under several system organ classes: Blood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders; nervous system disorders (intracranial haemorrhage); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders (epistaxis); gastrointestinal disorders (gingival bleeding, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal \n\nhaemorrhage); renal and urinary disorders (haematuria); injury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\n(contusion) and vascular disorders (ecchymosis). \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\n \n\nCases of allergic reactions  including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions \n\nincluding SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. A possible cross-reaction \n\nbetween lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients with a history of severe \n\nrash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies \n\nIn clinical trials in previously treated myeloma patients with lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared to \n\ncontrols, mainly comprising of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. \n\n \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia  \n\n• Multiple myeloma \nCases of AML have been observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients taking \n\nlenalidomide treatment in combination with melphalan or immediately following HDM/ASCT (see section \n\n4.4). This increase was not observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients \n\ntaking lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to thalidomide in combination with \n\nmelphalan and prednisone. \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\n• Myelodysplastic syndromes \nBaseline variables including complex cytogenetics and TP53 mutation are associated with progression to \n\nAML in subjects who are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality (see section 4.4). The \n\nestimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML were 13.8% in patients with an isolated Del (5q) \n\nabnormality compared to 17.3% for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic abnormality and \n\n38.6% in patients with a complex karyotype. \n\nIn a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndromes, the estimated 2-year \n\nrate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity and 3.6% in patients with IHC-\n\np53 negativity (p=0.0038). In the patients with IHC-p53 positivity, a lower rate of progression to AML was \n\nobserved amongst patients who achieved a transfusion independence (TI) response (11.1%) compared to a \n\nnon-responder (34.8%).  \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\nThe following post-marketing adverse reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): acute hepatic \n\nfailure and cholestasis (both potentially fatal), toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, mixed cytolytic/cholestatic \n\nhepatitis. \n\n \nRhabdomyolysis \n\nRare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been observed, some of them when lenalidomide is administered with a \n\nstatin. \n\n \nThyroid disorders  \n\nCases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported (see section 4.4 Thyroid \n\ndisorders). \n\n \n\nTumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome \n\nIn study MCL-002, approximately 10% of lenalidomide-treated patients experienced TFR compared to 0% \n\nin the control arm. The majority of the events occurred in cycle 1, all were assessed as treatment-related, and \n\nthe majority of the reports were grade 1 or 2. Patients with high MIPI at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least \n\none lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the longest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. In study MCL-002, TLS \n\nwas reported for one patient in each of the two treatment arms. In the supportive study MCL-001, \n\napproximately 10% of subjects experienced TFR; all report were grade 1 or 2 in severity and all were \n\nassessed as treatment-related. The majority of the events occurred in cycle 1. There were no reports of TLS \n\nin study MCL-001 (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn study NHL-007, TFR was reported in 19/146 (13.0%) of patients in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm \n\nversus 1/148 (0.7%) patients in the placebo/rituximab arm. Most TFRs (18 out of 19) reported in the \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab arm occurred during first two cycles of treatment. One FL patient in the \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR event versus no patients in the placebo/rituximab \n\narm. In study NHL-008, 7/177 (4.0%) of FL patients experienced TFR; (3 reports were Grade 1 and 4 reports \n\nwere Grade 2 severity); while 1 report was considered serious. In study NHL-007, TLS occurred in 2 FL \n\npatients (1.4%) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm and no FL patients in the placebo/rituximab arm; neither \n\npatient had a Grade 3 or 4 event. TLS occurred in 1 FL patient (0.6%) in study NHL-008. This single event \n\nwas identified as a serious, Grade 3 adverse reaction. For study NHL-007 no patients had to discontinue \n\nlenalidomide/rituximab therapy due to TFR or TLS. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. Gastrointestinal \n\nperforations may lead to septic complications and may be associated with fatal outcome. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 41 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients, although in dose-\n\nranging studies some patients were exposed to up to 150 mg, and in single-dose studies, some patients were \n\nexposed to up to 400 mg. The dose limiting toxicity in these studies was essentially haematological. In the \n\nevent of overdose, supportive care is advised. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunosuppressants. ATC code: L04AX04. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nLenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex \n\nthat includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4), and \n\nregulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon recruits substrate \n\nproteins Aiolos and Ikaros, lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent \n\ndegradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. \n\n \n\nSpecifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic tumour \n\ncells (including MM plasma tumour cells, follicular lymphoma tumour cells and those with deletions of \n\nchromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the number \n\nof NK, T and NK T cells. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide selectively inhibits the abnormal clone by \n\nincreasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells. \n\nThe combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in follicular \n\nlymphoma cells. \n\nThe lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and pro-\n\nerythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of \n\nendothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by CD34+ \n\nhaematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by \n\nmonocytes. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nLenalidomide efficacy and safety have been evaluated in six phase 3 studies in newly diagnosed multiple \n\nmyeloma, two phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, one phase 3 study and one phase 2 \n\nstudy in myelodysplastic syndromes and one phase 2 study in mantle cell lymphoma and one phase 3 and \n\none phase 3b study in iNHL as described below. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma \n\n• Lenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone ASCT \nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance was assessed in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised, \n\ndouble-blind 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02 \n\n \n\nCALGB 100104 \n\nPatients between 18 and 70 years of age with active MM requiring treatment and without prior progression \n\nafter initial treatment were eligible. \n\n \n\nPatients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo \n\nmaintenance. The maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles (increased \n\nup to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity), and treatment was continued \n\nuntil disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to the \n\ndate of progression or death, whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival \n\nendpoint. In total 460 patients were randomised: 231 patients to Lenalidomide and 229 patients to placebo. \n\nThe demographic and disease-related characteristics were balanced across both arms. \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n \n\nThe study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing the \n\nthreshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients in the placebo arm were \n\nallowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 17 December \n\n2009 (15.5 months follow up) showed a 62% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring \n\nlenalidomide (HR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.54; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 33.9 months (95% CI \n\nNE, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 19.0 months (95% CI 16.2, 25.6) in the placebo arm.  \n\n \n\nThe PFS benefit was observed both in the subgroup of patients with CR and in the subgroup of patients who \n\nhad not achieved a CR. \n\n \n\nThe results for the study, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016, are presented in Table 7. \n\n \n\nTable 7 Summary of overall efficacy data \n\n Lenalidomide \n\n(N = 231) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N = 229) \n\nInvestigator-assessed PFS   \n\nMediana PFS time, months (95% CI)b 56.9 (41.9, 71.7) 29,4 (20.7, 35.5) \n\nHR [95% CI]c; p-valued 0.61 (0.48, 0.76); <0.001 \n\nPFS2e   \n\nMediana PFS2 time, months (95% CI) b 80.2 (63.3, 101.8) 52.8 (41.3, 64.0) \n\nHR [95% CI]c ; p-valued 0.61 (0.48, 0.78); <0.001 \n\nOverall survival   \n\nMediana OS time, months (95% CI)b 111.0 (101.8, NE) 84.2 (71.0, 102.7) \n\n8-year survival rate, % (SE) 60.9 (3.78) 44.6 (3.98) \n\nHR [95% CI]c ; p-valued 0.61 (0.46, 0.81); <0.001 \n\nFollow-up   \n\nMedianf (min, max), months: all surviving patients 81.9 (0.0, 119.8) 81.0 (4.1, 119.5) \nCI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio; max = maximum; min = minimum; NE = not estimable; OS = overall survival; PFS = progression-free \n\nsurvival;  \na The median is based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate. \nb The 95% CI about the median. \nc Based on Cox proportional hazards model comparing the hazard functions associated with the indicated treatment arms. \nd The p-value is based on the unstratified log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier curve differences between the indicated treatment arms. \ne Exploratory endpoint (PFS2).

Treatment was to be continued until \n\ndisease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS defined from randomisation to the date of progression or death, whichever \n\noccurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival endpoint. In total 614 patients were \n\nrandomised: 307 patients to lenalidomide and 307 patients to placebo. \n\n \n\nThe study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing the \n\nthreshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients receiving placebo were not \n\ncrossed over to lenalidomide therapy prior to progressive disease. The lenalidomide arm was discontinued, \n\nas a proactive safety measure, after observing an imbalance of SPMs (see Section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 7 July 2010 \n\n(31.4 months follow up) showed a 48% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nlenalidomide (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.41, 0.66; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 40.1 months (95% CI \n\n35.7, 42.4) in the lenalidomide arm versus 22.8 months (95% CI 20.7, 27.4) in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\nThe PFS benefit was less in the subgroup of patients with CR than in the subgroup of patients who had not \n\nachieved a CR. \n\n \n\nThe updated PFS, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016 (96.7 months follow up) continues to show a PFS \n\nadvantage: HR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.47, 0.68; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 44.4 months (39.6, 52.0) \n\nin the lenalidomide arm versus 23.8 months (95% CI 21.2, 27.3) in the placebo arm. For PFS2, the observed \n\nHR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.66, 0.98; p = 0.026) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median overall PFS2 was \n\n69.9 months (95% CI 58.1, 80.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 58.4 months (95% CI 51.1, 65.0) in the \n\nplacebo arm. For OS, the observed HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.72, 1.13; p = 0.355) for lenalidomide versus \n\nplacebo. The median overall survival time was 105.9 months (95% CI 88.8, NE) in the lenalidomide arm \n\nversus 88.1 months (95% CI 80.7, 108.4) in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\n• Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible \nfor stem cell transplantation \n\nThe SWOG S0777 study evaluated the addition of bortezomib to a foundation of lenalidomide and \n\ndexamethasone, as initial treatment, followed by continued Rd until disease progression, in patients with \n\npreviously untreated multiple myeloma who are either ineligible for transplant or eligible for transplant with \n\nno plan to undertake immediate transplant.  \n \nPatients in the lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day \n\norally on days 1-14, intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone 20 \n\nmg/day orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of repeated 21-day cycles for up to eight 21-day cycles (24 \n\nweeks). Patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on \n\ndays 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to \n\nsix 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in both arms took continued Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on \n\ndays 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles. \n\nTreatment was to be continued until disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 523 patients were \n\nenrolled into the study, with 263 patients randomised to RVd and 260 patients randomised to Rd. The \n\ndemographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced between arms.  \n\n \n\nThe results of PFS, as assessed by IRAC, at the time of the primary analysis, using a cut-off of 05 November \n\n2015 (50.6 months follow up) showed a 24% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring RVd \n\n(HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.61, 0.94; p = 0.010). The median overall PFS was 42.5 months (95% CI 34.0, 54.8) in \n\nthe RVd arm versus 29.9 months (95% CI 25.6, 38.2) in the Rd arm. The benefit was observed regardless of \n\neligibility for stem cell transplant. \n\n \n\nThe results for the study, using a cut-off of 01 December 2016, where the median follow-up time for all \n\nsurviving subjects was 69.0 months, are presented in Table 8.

The proportion \n\nof subjects alive after 7 years was 54.7% in the RVd arm versus 44.7% in the Rd arm. \n\n \n\n• Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible for stem cell \ntransplantation \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, \n\n3-arm study (MM-020) of patients who were at least 65 years of age or older or, if younger than 65 years of \n\nage, were not candidates for stem cell transplantation because they declined to undergo stem cell \n\ntransplantation or stem cell transplantation is not available to the patient due to cost or other reason.The study \n\n(MM-020) compared lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different durations of time (i.e., until \n\nprogressive disease [Arm Rd] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72 weeks, Arm Rd18]) to melphalan, \n\nprednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for a maximum of twelve 42-day cycles (72 weeks). Patients were \n\nrandomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (≤75 versus >75 \n\nyears), stage (ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III), and country. \n\n \n\nPatients in the Rd and Rd18 arms took lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles \n\naccording to protocol arm. Dexamethasone 40 mg was dosed once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each \n\n28-day cycle. Initial dose and regimen for Rd and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal function \n\n(see section 4.2). Patients >75 years received a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15, \n\nand 22 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (low molecular weight \n\nheparin, warfarin, heparin, low-dose aspirin) during the study. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 1623 patients were \n\nenrolled into the study, with 535 patients randomised to Rd, 541 patients randomised to Rd18 and 547 \n\npatients randomised to MPT. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients \n\nwere well balanced in all 3 arms. In general, study subjects had advanced-stage disease: of the total study \n\npopulation, 41% had ISS stage III, 9% had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CLcr] \n\n< 30 mL/min).

Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm \n\nreceived lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus low dose dexamethasone – 40 mg/day on \n\ndays 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1%) \n\nunderwent at least one dose interruption compared to 65 patients (29.3%) in the lenalidomide/standard dose \n\ndexamethasone arm. \n\n \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nIn a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm 6.8% \n\n(15/220) compared to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm 19.3% (43/223), in the newly \n\ndiagnosed multiple myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 72.3 weeks. \n\n \n\nHowever with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall survival in favour of lenalidomide/ low dose \n\ndexamethasone tends to decrease. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma with at least one prior therapy \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised, double-\n\nblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group controlled studies (MM-009 and MM-010) of lenalidomide plus \n\ndexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. \n\nOut of 353 patients in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies who received lenalidomide/dexamethasone, 45.6% \n\nwere aged 65 or over. Of the 704 patients evaluated in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6% were aged \n\n65 or over. \n\n \n\nIn both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (len/dex) group took 25 mg of lenalidomide \n\norally once daily on days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on days 22 to 28 of each \n\n28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone (placebo/dex) group took 1 placebo capsule on days 1 \n\nto 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily \n\non days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy. The dose of \n\ndexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 4 of each 28-day cycle after the first \n\n4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until disease progression. In both studies, dose \n\nadjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory finding. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients were \n\nevaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the len/dex group and 176 in the placebo/dex group and, in total, \n\n351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the len/dex group and 175 in the placebo/dex \n\ngroup. \n\n \n\nIn both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between the \n\nlen/dex and placebo/dex groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with a \n\ncomparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both groups, as \n\nwas the number and type of prior therapies. \n\n \n\nPre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that len/dex was statistically significantly superior \n\n(p < 0.00001) to dexamethasone alone for the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP (median follow-up duration of \n\n98.0 weeks). Complete response and overall response rates in the len/dex arm were also significantly higher \n\nthan the placebo/dex arm in both studies. Results of these analyses subsequently led to an unblinding in both \n\nstudies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dex group to receive treatment with the len/dex \n\ncombination. \n\n \n\nAn extended follow-up efficacy analysis was conducted with a median follow-up of 130.7 weeks. Table 11 \n\nsummarises the results of the follow-up efficacy analyses – pooled studies MM-009 and MM-010. \n\n \n\nIn this pooled extended follow-up analysis, the median TTP was 60.1 weeks (95% CI: 44.3, 73.1) in patients \n\ntreated with len/dex (N = 353) versus 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 17.7, 20.3) in patients treated with placebo/dex \n\n(N = 351). The median progression free survival was 48.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.4, 62.1) in patients treated \n\nwith len/dex versus 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.1, 20.1) in patients treated with placebo/dex. The median \n\nduration of treatment was 44.0 weeks (min: 0.1, max: 254.9) for len/dex and 23.1 weeks (min: 0.3, max: \n\n238.1) for placebo/dex. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and overall response (CR+PR) rates \n\nin the len/dex arm remain significantly higher than in the placebo/dex arm in both studies. The median \n\noverall survival in the extended follow-up analysis of the pooled studies is 164.3 weeks (95% CI: 145.1, \n\n192.6) in patients treated with len/dex versus 136.4 weeks (95% CI: 113.1, 161.7) in patients treated with \n\nplacebo/dex. Despite the fact that 170 out of the 351 patients randomised to placebo/dex received \n\nlenalidomide after disease progression or after the studies were unblinded, the pooled analysis of overall \n\nsurvival demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage for len/dex relative to placebo/dex \n\n(HR = 0.833, 95% CI = [0.687, 1.009], p=0.045). \n\n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nTable 11.

Patients who did not have evidence of at least a minor erythroid \n\nresponse after 16 weeks were to be discontinued from treatment. Patients who had evidence of at least a \n\nminor erythroid response could continue therapy until erythroid relapse, disease progression or unacceptable \n\ntoxicity. Patients, who initially received placebo or 5 mg lenalidomide and did not achieve at least a minor \n\nerythroid response after 16 weeks of treatment were permitted to switch from placebo to 5 mg lenalidomide \n\nor continue lenalidomide treatment at higher dose (5 mg to 10 mg). \n\n \n\nIn, study MDS-003, in which 148 patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg, the primary efficacy \n\nanalysis consisted of an evaluation of the efficacy of lenalidomide treatments to achieve haematopoietic \n\nimprovement in subjects with low- or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes. \n\n \n\nTable 12.

Amongst the 47 patients with an isolated Del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality and treated \n\nwith lenalidomide 10 mg, 27 patients (57.4%) achieved red blood cell transfusion independence. \n\n \n\nThe median time to transfusion independence in the lenalidomide 10 mg arm was 4.6 weeks. The median \n\nduration of transfusion independence was not reached in any of the treatment arms but should exceed 2 years \n\nfor the lenalidomide-treated subjects. The median increase in haemoglobin (Hgb) from baseline in the 10 mg \n\narm was 6.4 g/dL.  \n\n \n\nAdditional endpoints of the study included cytogenetic response (in the 10 mg arm major and minor \n\ncytogenetic responses were observed in 30.0% and 24.0% of subjects, respectively), assessment of Health \n\nRelated Quality of Life (HRQoL) and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the cytogenetic \n\nresponse and HRQoL were consistent with the findings of the primary endpoint and in favour of \n\nlenalidomide treatment compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nIn MDS-003, a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved transfusion \n\nindependence (>182 days) on lenalidomide 10 mg (58.1%). The median time to transfusion independence \n\nwas 4.1 weeks. The median duration of transfusion independence was 114.4 weeks. The median increase in \n\nhaemoglobin (Hgb) was 5.6 g/dL. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 40.9% and \n\n30.7% of subjects, respectively.  \n\n \n\nA large proportion of subjects enrolled in MDS-003 (72.9%) and MDS-004 (52.7%) had received prior \n\nerythropoiesis-stimulating agents. \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in patients with mantle cell lymphoma in a phase 2, \n\nmulticentre, randomised open-label study versus single agent of investigator’s choice in patients who were \n\nrefractory to their last regimen or had relapsed one to three times (study MCL-002). \n\nPatients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically-proven MCL and CT-measurable disease were \n\nenrolled. Patients were required to have received adequate previous treatment with at least one prior \n\ncombination chemotherapy regimen. Also, patients had to be ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or \n\ntransplant at time of inclusion in the study. Patients were randomised 2:1 to the lenalidomide or the control \n\narm. The investigator’s choice treatment was selected before randomisation and consisted of monotherapy \n\nwith either chlorambucil, cytarabine, rituximab, fludarabine, or gemcitabine. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide was administered orally 25 mg once daily for the first 21 days (D1 to D21) of repeating \n\n28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with moderate renal insufficiency were to \n\nreceive a lower starting dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily on the same schedule.  \n\n \n\nThe baseline demographic were comparable between the lenalidomide arm and control arm. Both patient \n\npopulations presented a median age of 68.5 years with comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG \n\nperformance status was comparable between both groups, as was the number of prior therapies. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in study MCL-002 was progression-free survival (PFS). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy results for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were assessed by the Independent Review \n\nCommittee (IRC), and are presented in the table below. \n\n \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nTable 13.

In patients with high tumour \n\nburden, corresponding figures were 16/81 (20%) and 2/28 (7%) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\nAUGMENT - CC-5013-NHL-007  \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo was \n\nevaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL including FL in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, \n\ndouble- blind controlled study (CC-5013-NHL-007 [AUGMENT]). \n\n \n\nA total of 358 patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed MZL or Grade 1, 2 or \n\n3a FL (CD20+ by flow cytometry or histochemistry) as assessed by the investigator or local pathologist were \n\nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects had been previously treated with at least one prior systemic \n\nchemotherapy, immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide was administered orally 20 mg once daily for the first 21 days of repeating 28-day cycles for \n\n12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (days \n\n1, 8, 15, and 22) and on day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5. All dosage calculations for \n\nrituximab were based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), using actual patient weight. \n\n \n\nThe demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment groups. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with \n\nrituximab to rituximab plus placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL Grade 1, 2 or 3a or MZL. \n\nEfficacy determination was based upon PFS as the primary endpoint, as assessed by the IRC using the 2007 \n\nInternational Working Group (IWG) criteria but without positron emission tomography (PET).  \n\n\n\n 51 \n\n \n\nThe secondary objectives of the study were to compare the safety of lenalidomide in combination with \n\nrituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. Further secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of \n\nrituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo using the following other parameters of efficacy: \n\nOverall response rate (ORR), CR rate, and duration of response (DoR) by IWG 2007 without PET and OS. \n\n \n\nResults from the overall population including FL and MZL showed that at a median follow up of \n\n28.3°months, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval \n\n[CI]) of 0.45 (0.33,0.61) p-value < 0.0001.

Subjects who achieved CR/CRu, PR, or SD by the end of the \n\ninduction treatment period were randomised to enter the maintenance treatment period. All enrolled subjects \n\nmust have previously been treated with at least one prior systemic antilymphoma therapy. In contrast to \n\nstudy NHL-007, the NHL-008 study included patients who were refractory to rituximab (no response or \n\nrelapsed within 6 months of rituximab treatment or who were double-refractory to rituximab and \n\nchemotherapy). \n\n\n\n 52 \n\n \n\nDuring the induction treatment period, lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-day \n\ncycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent or disease progression. The \n\ndose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and on Day 1 of every other \n\n28-day cycle (cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) up to 12 cycles therapy. All dosage calculations for rituximab were \n\nbased on the patient body surface area (BSA) and actual weight. \n\n \n\nThe data presented are based on an interim analysis focusing on the single-arm induction treatment period.. \n\nEfficacy determinations are based on ORR by best response as the primary endpoint, using a modification of \n\nthe 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC).

(see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nLenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-) and \n\nR(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in organic \n\nsolvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1N HCl buffer. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nLenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting \n\nconditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In patients, \n\nas well as in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-concentration time \n\ncurve (AUC) increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple dosing does not cause marked \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nmedicinal product accumulation. In plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R- enantiomers of \n\nlenalidomide are approximately 56% and 44%, respectively. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy volunteers reduces the extent of \n\nabsorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in area under the concentration versus time curve \n\n(AUC) and 50% decrease in Cmax in plasma. However, in the main multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic \n\nsyndromes registration trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide, the medicinal \n\nproduct was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or \n\nwithout food. \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the oral absorption rate of lenalidomide is similar among \n\nMM, MDS and MCL patients. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nIn vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins was low with mean plasma protein binding at 23% \n\nand 29% in multiple myeloma patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is present in human semen (< 0.01% of the dose) after administration of 25 mg/day and the \n\nmedicinal product is undetectable in semen of a healthy subject 3 days after stopping the substance (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nResults from human in vitro metabolism studies indicate that lenalidomide is not metabolised by cytochrome \n\nP450 enzymes suggesting that administration of lenalidomide with medicinal products that inhibit \n\ncytochrome P450 enzymes is not likely to result in metabolic medicinal product interactions in humans. In \n\nvitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, \n\nCYP2E1, CYP3A, or UGT1A1. Therefore, lenalidomide is unlikely to cause any clinically relevant \n\nmedicinal product interactions when co-administered with substrates of these enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein \n\n(BCRP), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporters MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3, organic anion \n\ntransporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), organic \n\ncation transporters (OCT) OCT1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) MATE1, and \n\norganic cation transporters novel (OCTN) OCTN1 and OCTN2. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on human bile salt export pump (BSEP), \n\nBCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2. \n\n \n\nA majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary excretion. The contribution of renal excretion to \n\ntotal clearance in subjects with normal renal function was 90%, with 4% of lenalidomide eliminated in \n\nfaeces. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-\n\nlenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the excreted dose, respectively. The \n\nrenal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is at least actively \n\nsecreted to some extent. \n\n \n\nAt doses of 5 to 25 mg/day, half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours in healthy volunteers and ranges \n\nfrom 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes or mantle cell lymphoma. \n\n \n\nOlder people \n\nNo dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the \n\nelderly. Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with ages ranging from 39 to 85 years old \n\nand indicate that age does not influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). Because elderly \n\npatients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it would \n\nbe prudent to monitor renal function. \n\n \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to nonmalignant \n\nconditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary creatinine clearance \n\nmeasured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula. The results \n\nindicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 mL/min), the total lenalidomide clearance decreases \n\nproportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was increased by approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold \n\nin subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease, \n\nrespectively, compared to the group combining subjects with normal renal function and subjects with mild \n\nrenal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased from approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with \n\ncreatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours in subjects with reduced renal function < 50 mL/min. \n\nHowever, renal impairment did not alter the oral absorption of lenalidomide. The Cmax was similar between \n\nhealthy subjects and patients with renal impairment. Approximately 30% of the medicinal product in the \n\nbody was removed during a single 4-hour dialysis session. Recommended dose adjustments in patients with \n\nimpaired renal function are described in section 4.2. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with mild hepatic impairment (N=16, total bilirubin \n\n>1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and indicate that mild hepatic impairment does not influence \n\nlenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). There are no data available for patients with moderate to severe \n\nhepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nOther intrinsic factors  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of \n\nhaematological malignancy (MM, MDS or MCL) do not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide \n\nclearance in adult patients.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAn embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at doses \n\nfrom 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced external \n\nmalformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities (bent, shortened, \n\nmalformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or polydactyly) in the offspring of \n\nfemale monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.  \n\n \n\nVarious visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-\n\nventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses. \n\n \n\nLenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were > 2000 \n\nmg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for up to 26 weeks \n\nproduced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all 3 doses, most notably \n\nin females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be less than 75 mg/kg/day, and \n\nis approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on AUC exposure. Repeated oral \n\nadministration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks produced mortality and significant \n\ntoxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and platelet counts, multiple organ \n\nhaemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone marrow atrophy). Repeated oral \n\nadministration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year produced reversible changes in bone \n\nmarrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell ratio and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of \n\nwhite blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately the same human dose \n\nbased on AUC comparisons. \n\n \n\nIn vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell \n\ntransformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either \n\nthe gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were \n\nadministered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was observed at \n\n10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 20 mg/kg/day. Although \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nit was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct effect. Soft tissue and skeletal \n\nvariations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Revlimid is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Revlimid is \n\nRevlimid contains the active substance ‘lenalidomide’. This medicine belongs to a group of medicines which \n\naffect how your immune system works. \n\n \n\nWhat Revlimid is used for \n\nRevlimid is used in adults for: \n\n• Multiple myeloma \n\n• Myelodysplastic syndromes \n\n• Mantle cell lymphoma \n\n• Follicular lymphoma \n \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the plasma cell. \n\nThese cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can damage the bones and \n\nkidneys.  \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly reduced or \n\ndisappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘response’. \n\n \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant \n\nRevlimid is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have recovered enough following a bone \n\nmarrow transplant. \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant \n\nRevlimid is taken with other medicines. These may include: \n\n• a chemotherapy medicine called ‘bortezomib’ \n\n• an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’ \n\n• a chemotherapy medicine called ‘melphalan’ and \n\n• an immunosuppressant medicine called ‘prednisone’.  \nYou will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take Revlimid on its own. \n\n \n\nIf you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check you \n\ncarefully before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma – in patients who have had treatment before \n\nRevlimid is taken together with an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’.  \n\n \n\nRevlimid can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting worse. It has also been shown to \n\ndelay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.  \n\n \n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) \n\nMDS are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow diseases. The blood cells become abnormal \n\nand do not function properly. Patients can experience a variety of signs and symptoms including a low red \n\nblood cell count (anaemia), the need for a blood transfusion, and be at risk of infection. \n\n \n\nRevlimid is used alone to treat adult patients who have been diagnosed with MDS, when all of the following \n\napply: \n\n• you need regular blood transfusions to treat low levels of red blood cells (‘transfusion-dependent \nanaemia’) \n\n• you have an abnormality of cells in the bone marrow called an ‘isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic \nabnormality’. This means your body does not make enough healthy blood cells \n\n• other treatments have been used before, are not suitable or do not work well enough. \n \n\nRevlimid can increase the number of healthy red blood cells that the body produces by reducing the number \n\nof abnormal cells:  \n\n• this can reduce the number of blood transfusions needed. It is possible that no transfusions will be \nneeded. \n\n \n\nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL) \n\nMCL is a cancer of part of the immune system (the lymph tissue). It affects a type of white blood cell called \n\n‘B-lymphocytes’ or B-cells. MCL is a disease where B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way and build up in the \n\nlymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. \n\n \n\nRevlimid is used alone to treat adult patients who have previously been treated with other medicines. \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma (FL) \n\nFL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that help \n\nyour body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in your blood, \n\nbone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. \n\n \n\nRevlimid is taken together with another medicine called ‘rituximab’ for the treatment of adult patients with \n\npreviously treated follicular lymphoma. \n\n\n\n 89 \n\n \n\nHow Revlimid works \n\nRevlimid works by affecting the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It works in a \n\nnumber of different ways: \n\n• by stopping the cancer cells developing \n\n• by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer \n\n• by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Revlimid \n\n \n\nYou must read the package leaflet of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with Revlimid \n\nbefore starting treament with Revlimid. \n\n \n\nDo not take Revlimid: \n\n• if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as Revlimid is \nexpected to be harmful to an unborn child (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and \n\ncontraception – information for women and men’). \n\n• if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you from \nbecoming pregnant (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception – information for \n\nwomen and men’). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription \n\nthat the necessary measures have been taken and provide you with this confirmation. \n\n• if you are allergic to lenalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. If \nyou think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, do not take Revlimid. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Revlimid if: \n\n• you have had blood clots in the past - you have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins \nand arteries during treatment \n\n• you have any signs of an infection, such as a cough or fever  \n\n• you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly: hepatitis B infection, varicella zoster, \nHIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with Revlimid may cause the virus to become \n\nactive again, in patients who carry the virus. This results in a recurrence of the infection. Your doctor \nshould check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection \n\n• you have kidney problems - your doctor may adjust your dose of Revlimid \n\n• you have had a heart attack, have ever had a blood clot, or if you smoke, have high blood pressure or \nhigh cholesterol levels \n\n• you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking thalidomide (another medicine used to treat multiple \nmyeloma) such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or trouble breathing \n\n• you have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: widespread rash, red \nskin, high body temperature, flu-like symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, blood abnormalities \n\n(eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes – these are signs of a severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction \n\nwith Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity \n\nsyndrome. (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nAt any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you:  \n\n• experience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in \nthe way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of \n\nsensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain \n\ncondition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these symptoms \n\nprior to treatment with Revlimid, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms.  \n\n\n\n 90 \n\n• experience shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness, pain in the chest, a faster heartbeat, or swelling in \nthe legs or ankles. These may be symptoms of a serious condition known as pulmonary hypertension \n\n(see section 4). \n\n \n\nTests and checks \n\nBefore and during the treatment with Revlimid you will have regular blood tests. This is because Revlimid \n\nmay cause a fall in the blood cells that help fight infection (white blood cells) and help the blood to clot \n\n(platelets).  \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test: \n\n• before treatment  \n\n• every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment \n\n• then at least every month after that. \n \n\nYou may be evaluated for signs of cardiopulmonary problems before and during the treatment with \n\nlenalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor patients with MDS taking Revlimid \n\nIf you have MDS, you may be more likely to get a more advanced condition called acute myeloid leukaemia \n\n(AML). In addition, it is not known how Revlimid affects the chances of you getting AML. Your doctor may \n\ntherefore do tests to check for signs which may better predict the likelihood of you getting AML during your \n\ntreatment with Revlimid. \n\n \n\nFor patients with MCL taking Revlimid \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test: \n\n• before treatment \n\n• every week for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment \n\n• then every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4 (see section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) \n\n• after this it will happen at the start of each cycle and \n\n• at least every month. \n \n\nFor patients with FL taking Revlimid \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test: \n\n• before treatment  \n\n• every week for the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment \n\n• then every 2 weeks in cycles 2 to 4 (see Section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) \n\n• After this it will happen at the start of each cycle and \n\n• at least every month. \n \n\nYour doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your bone \n\nmarrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals \n\nin the blood which can lead to kidney failure (this condition is called ‘Tumour Lysis Syndrome’).  \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check you for changes to your skin such as red spots or rashes. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may adjust your dose of Revlimid or stop your treatment based on the results of your blood tests \n\nand on your general condition. If you are newly diagnosed, your doctor may also assess your treatment based \n\non your age and other conditions you already have. \n\n \n\nBlood donation \n\nYou should not donate blood during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRevlimid is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n\n \n\nElderly and people with kidney problems \n\nIf you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check you \n\ncarefully before starting treatment. \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Revlimid \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This is because \n\nRevlimid can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way \n\nRevlimid works. \n\n \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n• some medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral contraceptives, as they may stop working \n\n• some medicines used for heart problems – such as digoxin \n\n• some medicines used to thin the blood – such as warfarin. \n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception - information for women and men \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nFor women taking Revlimid \n\n• You must not take Revlimid if you are pregnant, as it is expected to be harmful to an unborn baby.  \n\n• You must not become pregnant while taking Revlimid. Therefore you must use effective methods of \ncontraception if you are a woman of childbearing potential (see ‘Contraception’). \n\n• If you do become pregnant during your treatment with Revlimid, you must stop the treatment and inform \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nFor men taking Revlimid \n\n• If your partner becomes pregnant whilst you are taking Revlimid, you should inform your doctor \nimmediately. It is recommended that your partner seeks medical advice. \n\n• You must also use effective methods of contraception (see ‘Contraception’). \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nYou must not breast-feed when taking Revlimid, as it is not known if Revlimid passes into breast milk. \n\n \n\nContraception \n\nFor women taking Revlimid \n\nBefore starting the treatment, ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think this is \n\nunlikely. \n\n \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant  \n\n• you will have pregnancy tests under the supervision of your doctor (before every treatment, at least every \n4 weeks during treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished) except where it has been \n\nconfirmed that the fallopian tubes have been severed and sealed, to stop eggs from reaching the uterus \n\n(tubal sterilisation) \n\nAND \n\n• you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, during \ntreatment, and until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Your doctor will advise you on appropriate \n\nmethods of contraception. \n\n \n\nFor men taking Revlimid \n\nRevlimid passes into human semen. If your female partner is pregnant or able to become pregnant, and she \n\ndoes not use effective methods of contraception, you must use condoms during treatment and for at least 7 \n\ndays after the end of treatment, even if you have had a vasectomy. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel dizzy, tired, sleepy, have vertigo or blurred vision after taking \n\nRevlimid. \n\n \n\nRevlimid contains lactose \n\nRevlimid contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, \n\ncontact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n 92 \n\n \n\n3. How to take Revlimid \n\n \n\nRevlimid must be given to you by healthcare professionals with experience in treating multiple myeloma, \n\nMDS, MCL or FL. \n\n• When Revlimid is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant \nor have had other treatments before, it is taken with other medicines (see section 1 ‘What Revlimid is \n\nused for’).  \n\n• When Revlimid is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant or \nto treat patients with MDS or MCL, it is taken alone. \n\n• When Revlimid is used to treat follicular lymphoma, it is taken with another medicine called ‘rituximab’.  \n\n \n\nAlways take Revlimid exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are \n\nnot sure. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking Revlimid in combination with other medicines, you should refer to the package leaflets for \n\nthese medicines for further information on their use and effects. \n\n \n\nTreatment cycle \n\nRevlimid is taken on certain days over 3 weeks (21 days).  \n\n• Every 21 days is called a ‘treatment cycle’. \n\n• Depending on the day of the cycle, you will take one or more of the medicines. However, on some days \nyou do not take any of the medicines. \n\n• After completing every 21-day cycle, you should start a new ‘cycle’ over the next 21 days.  \nOR \n\nRevlimid is taken on certain days over 4 weeks (28 days).  \n\n• Every 28 days is called a ‘treatment cycle’. \n\n• Depending on the day of the cycle, you will take one or more of the medicines. However, on some days \nyou do not take any of the medicines. \n\n• After completing every 28-day cycle, you should start a new ‘cycle’ over the next 28 days.  \n \n\nHow much Revlimid to take \n\nBefore you start treatment, your doctor will tell you: \n\n• how much Revlimid you should take \n• how much of the other medicines you should take in combination with Revlimid, if any \n• on what days of your treatment cycle to take each medicine. \n \n\nHow and when to take Revlimid \n\n• swallow the capsules whole, preferably with water.  \n\n• do not break, open or chew the capsules. If powder from a broken Revlimid capsule makes contact with \nthe skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n• healthcare professionals, caregivers and family members should wear disposable gloves when handling \nthe blister or capsule. Gloves should then be removed carefully to prevent skin exposure, placed in a \n\nsealable plastic polyethylene bag and disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Hands should \n\nthen be washed thoroughly with soap and water. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be \n\npregnant should not handle the blister or capsule. \n\n• the capsules can be taken either with or without food. \n\n• you should take Revlimid at about the same time on the scheduled days. \n \n\nTaking this medicine \n\nTo remove the capsule from the blister: \n\n• press only one end of the capsule out to push it through the foil \n\n• do not put pressure on the centre of the capsule, as this can cause it to break. \n \n\n\n\n 93 \n\n \n \n\nDuration of the treatment with Revlimid \n\nRevlimid is taken in treatment cycles, each cycle lasting 21 or 28 days (see above ‘Treatment cycle’). You \n\nshould continue the cycles of treatment until your doctor tells you to stop. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Revlimid than you should \n\nIf you take more Revlimid than was prescribed, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Revlimid \n\nIf you forget to take Revlimid at your regular time and: \n\n• less than 12 hours have passed - take your capsule immediately. \n\n• more than 12 hours have passed - do not take your capsule. Take your next capsule at the usual time the \nnext day. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, Revlimid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\n \n\nStop taking Revlimid and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side \n\neffects – you may need urgent medical treatment: \n\n• Hives, rashes, swelling of eyes, mouth or face, difficulty breathing, or itching, which may be symptoms \nof serious types of allergic reactions called angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. \n\n• A serious allergic reaction that may begin as a rash in one area but spread with extensive loss of skin \nover the whole body (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and/or toxic epidermal necrolysis). \n\n• Widespread rash, high body temperature, liver enzyme elevations, blood abnormalities (eosinophilia), \nenlarged lymph nodes and other body organs involvement (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and \n\nSystemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome). See also \n\nsection 2. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects: \n\n• Fever, chills, sore throat, cough, mouth ulcers or any other symptoms of infection including within the \nbloodstream (sepsis) \n\n• Bleeding or bruising in the absence of injury \n\n• Chest pain or leg pain \n\n• Shortness of breath \n\n• Bone pain, muscle weakness, confusion or tiredness that might be due to high level of calcium in the \nblood.  \n\n \n\nRevlimid may reduce the number of white blood cells that fight infection and also the blood cells which help \n\nthe blood to clot (platelets) which may lead to bleeding disorders such as nosebleeds and bruising.  \n\nRevlimid may also cause blood clots in the veins (thrombosis). \n\n \n\n\n\n 94 \n\nOther side effects \n\nIt is important to note that a small number of patients may develop additional types of cancer, and it is \n\npossible that this risk may be increased with Revlimid treatment.

The PRAC concluded that the product \n\ninformation of products containing lenalidomide should be amended accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk \n\nbalance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes \n\nto the product information \n\n \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
