NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBydureon 2 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 2 mg of exenatide.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection.\n\nPowder: white to off-white powder.\nSolvent: clear, colourless to pale yellow to pale brown solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic \ncontrol in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when \nthe therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. \n\nPatients switching from immediate-release (Byetta) to prolonged-release (Bydureon or Bydureon \nBCise) exenatide, may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, which \ngenerally improve within the first two weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching between the \nprolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no expected \nrelevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, \nthe current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to \nsulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day \nof weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least \nthree days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without \nmeals. \n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly \nscheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly \ndosing schedule. \n\n\n\n3\n\nIf a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not \nadminister the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly \nscheduled dosing day.\n\nThe use of prolonged-release exenatide does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose \nself-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when \nprolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin \ndose reduction is recommended. \n\nIf a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release \nexenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the medicinal product (see section \n5.2).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, \nconsideration should be given to the patient\u2019s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nProlonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or \nsevere renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of prolonged-release exenatide in children and adolescents aged under\n18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nSubcutaneous use\nProlonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each kit should be used by one \nperson only and is for single use. \n\nPrior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and \ncaregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d, provided in the \ncarton, must be followed carefully.\n\nEach dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a \nsubcutaneous injection immediately after suspension of the powder in the solvent. \n\nWhen used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate \ninjections.\n\nFor instructions on the suspension of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the\ntreatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.\nProlonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in \ninsulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). \n\nProlonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide \nincreased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release \nexenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal \nimpairment (GFR < 30 mL/min).\n\nThere have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum \ncreatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes \nrequiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect \nhydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to \naffect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin \nconverting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal \nproducts and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive \ntreatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.\n\nSevere gastrointestinal disease\nProlonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, \nincluding gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, \nincluding nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of prolonged-release exenatide is not \nrecommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In \nclinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% of patients. There \nhave been spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. \nResolution of pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of \nnecrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed \nof the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, prolonged-release exenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \nprolonged-release exenatide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a \nhistory of pancreatitis.\n\nConcomitant medicinal products\nThe concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide with D-phenylalanine derivatives (meglitinides), \nalpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor agonists has \nnot been studied. The concurrent use of prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide has not\nbeen studied and is not recommended.\n\nInteraction with warfarin\nThere have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalised Ratio), \nsometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination \nwith a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a \nsulphonylurea combination, with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia \ncompared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with \nthe use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.\n\n\n\n5\n\nRapid weight loss\nRapid weight loss at a rate of  > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. \nWeight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.\n\nDiscontinuation of treatment\nAfter discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of \nexenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be \nconsidered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist \nuntil exenatide levels decline.\n\nExcipients\nSodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSulphonylureas\nThe dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia \nassociated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nGastric emptying\nThe results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of \nprolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically \nsignificant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral \nmedicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric \nemptying are required.\n\nWhen 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following \n14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were \nobserved compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) \nand tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and \n1.3 hours (fed). \n\nThe following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but \nnot prolonged-release exenatide:\n\nWarfarin\nA delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after \nimmediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased \nINR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release \nexenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in \npatients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nHydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors\nLovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was \ndelayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single \ndose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide \nand HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see \nsection 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be \nmonitored as appropriate.\n\nDigoxin and lisinopril\nIn interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were \nno clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed. \n\n\n\n6\n\nEthinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel\nAdministration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg \nlevonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of \neither ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after \nexenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and \nCmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The \nreduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is \nrequired.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nDue to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential \nshould use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicinal product \nshould be discontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is \nrecommended. \n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be \nused during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nNo fertility studies in humans have been conducted.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nProlonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When\nprolonged-release exenatide is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to \ntake precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea which was the most \nfrequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over time, and \ndiarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia (with a \nsulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release \nexenatide were mild to moderate in intensity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and \nspontaneous reports (not observed in clinical studies, frequency not known) are summarised in Table 1 \nbelow.\n\nIn the prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies, background therapies included diet and exercise, \nmetformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering medicinal \nproducts or a basal insulin. \n\n\n\n7\n\nThe reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and \nspontaneous reports\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nDrug-induced \nthrombocytopenia\n\nX4\n\nImmune system disorders\nAnaphylactic reaction X1\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nHypoglycaemia (with \na sulphonylurea)\n\nX1\n\nHypoglycaemia (with \ninsulin)\n\nX2,3\n\nDecreased appetite X1\n\nDehydration X1\n\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache X1\n\nDizziness X1\n\nDysgeusia X1\n\nSomnolence X1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nIntestinal obstruction X1\n\nAcute pancreatitis (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nX1\n\nNausea X1\n\nVomiting X1\n\nDiarrhoea X1\n\nDyspepsia X1\n\nAbdominal pain X1\n\nGastroesophageal \nreflux disease\n\nX1\n\nAbdominal distension X1\n\nEructation X1\n\nConstipation X1\n\nFlatulence X1\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nMacular and papular \nrash\n\nX4\n\nPruritus, and/ or \nurticaria\n\nX1\n\nAngioneurotic oedema X4\n\nInjection site abscesses \nand cellulitis\n\nX4\n\n\n\n8\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nHyperhidrosis X1\n\nAlopecia X1\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nAltered renal function, \nincluding acute renal \nfailure, worsened \nchronic renal failure, \nrenal impairment, \nincreased serum \ncreatinine (see section \n4.4).\n\nX1\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site pruritus X1\n\nFatigue X1\n\nInjection site erythema X1\n\nInjection site rash X1\n\nAsthenia X1\n\nFeeling jittery X1\n\nInvestigations\nInternational \nnormalised ratio \nincreased (see section \n4.4)\n\nX4\n\n1 Rate based on twelve prolonged-release exenatide completed long-term efficacy and safety studies \nn = 2868 total (patients on sulphonylurea n = 1002).\n2 Based on hypoglycaemic events that 1.

DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by drug-\ndependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the presence \nof the sensitizing drug.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea (24.0% versus 5.4%) (see section 4.4). To reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may \nbe considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n9\n\nProlonged-release exenatide was associated with a significantly lower incidence of episodes of \nhypoglycaemia than basal insulin in patients also receiving metformin therapy (3% versus 19%) and in \npatients also receiving metformin plus sulphonylurea therapy (20% versus 42%).\n\nAcross 12 studies of prolonged-release exenatide most episodes (99.9% n = 649) of hypoglycaemia \nwere minor, and resolved with oral administration of carbohydrate. One patient was reported with \nmajor hypoglycaemia since he had a low blood glucose value (2.2 mmol/L) and requested assistance \nwith oral carbohydrate treatment which resolved the event.\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin \nwas required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically \nsignificant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no \nepisodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.\n\nNausea\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction was nausea. In patients treated with prolonged-release \nexenatide, generally 20% reported at least one episode of nausea compared to 34% of \nimmediate-release exenatide patients. Most episodes of nausea were mild to moderate. With continued \ntherapy, the frequency decreased in most patients who initially experienced nausea. \n\nThe incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events during the 30-week controlled study was 6% for \nprolonged-release exenatide treated patients, 5% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. The \nmost common adverse events leading to withdrawal in either treatment group were nausea and \nvomiting. Withdrawal due to nausea or vomiting each occurred in < 1% for prolonged-release \nexenatide treated patients and 1% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. \n\nInjection site reactions\nInjection site reactions were observed more frequently in prolonged-release exenatide treated patients \nversus comparator-treated patients (16% versus range of 2-7%) during the 6-month controlled phase of \nstudies. These injection site reactions were generally mild and usually did not lead to withdrawal from \nstudies. Patients may be treated to relieve symptoms, while continuing treatment. Subsequent \ninjections should use a different site of injection each week. In postmarketing experiences, cases with \ninjection site abscesses and cellulitis have been reported. \n\nSmall subcutaneous injection site nodules were observed very frequently in clinical studies, consistent \nwith the known properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most \nindividual nodules were asymptomatic, did not interfere with study participation and resolved over 4 \nto 8 weeks.\n\nImmunogenicity\nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, \npatients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. In \nmost patients who develop antibodies, antibody titres diminish over time. \n\nThe presence of antibodies (high or low titres) is not predictive of glycaemic control for an individual \npatient.\n\nIn clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, approximately 45% of patients had low titre \nantibodies to exenatide at study endpoint. Overall, the percentage of antibody positive patients was \nconsistent across clinical studies. Overall, the level of glycaemic control (HbA1c) was comparable to \nthat observed in those without antibody titres. On average in the phase 3 studies, 12% of the patients \nhad higher titre antibodies. In a proportion of these the glycaemic response to prolonged-release \nexenatide was absent at the end of the controlled period of studies; 2.6% of patients showed no \nglucose improvement with higher titre antibodies whereas 1.6% showed no improvement while \nantibody negative.\n\n\n\n10\n\nPatients who developed antibodies to exenatide tend to have more injection site reactions (for \nexample: redness of skin and itching), but otherwise similar rates and types of adverse events as those \nwith no antibodies to exenatide.\n\nFor prolonged-release exenatide treated patients, the incidence of potentially immunogenic injection \nsite reactions (most commonly pruritus with or without erythema) during the 30-week and the two \n26-week studies was 9%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative patients \n(4%) compared with antibody-positive patients (13%), with a greater incidence in those with higher \ntitre antibodies.\n\nExamination of antibody-positive specimens revealed no significant cross-reactivity with similar \nendogenous peptides (glucagon or GLP-1).\n\nRapid weight loss\nIn a 30-week study, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated patients \nexperienced at least one time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between two \nconsecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week). \n\nIncreased heart rate\nA mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was \nobserved in pooled prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies. Fifteen percent of prolonged-release \nexenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm; approximately 5% to 10% of \nsubjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nEffects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included \nsevere nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of \noverdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient\u2019s clinical signs \nand symptoms. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC \ncode: A10BJ01.\n\nMechanism of action\nExenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several \nantihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of \nexenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate \nthe known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or \nother intracellular signalling pathways. \n\nExenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. \nAs blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in \ncombination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nthiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section \n4.4).\n\nExenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. \nHowever, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to \nhypoglycaemia. \n\nExenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in \nthe circulation.\n\nAdministration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and \nincreased satiety.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nExenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and \nfasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-\nrelease exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once \nweekly administration.\n\nA pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a \nrestoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to \nan intravenous bolus of glucose.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe results of long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide are presented below; these \nstudies comprised 1356 subjects treated with prolonged-release exenatide, 52% men and 48% women; \n230 subjects (17%) were \u2265 65 years of age.\n\nIn addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled \n14,752 subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care.\n\nGlycaemic control\nIn two studies prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly has been compared to immediate-release \nexenatide 5 mcg given twice daily for 4 weeks followed by immediate-release exenatide 10 mcg given \ntwice daily. One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 30 weeks (n = 295) \nfollowed by an open labelled extension where all patients were treated with prolonged-release \nexenatide 2 mg once weekly, for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, decreases in HbA1c were \nevident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c measurement (Weeks 4 or \n6).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to \npatients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 2).\n\nA clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated \nsubjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.\n\nClinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to \nimmediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of \u2264 7% or < 7% in the two studies \n(p < 0.05 and p \u2264 0.0001, respectively). \n\nBoth prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight \ncompared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. \n\nIn the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to \nprolonged-release exenatide at Week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% \nat Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.\n\n\n\n12\n\nFor all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients \nincluded in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from Week 52 onwards, but \nwas still reduced compared to baseline after 7 years (-1.5%). Weight loss was sustained over 7 years in \nthese patients.\n\nTable 2: Results of two studies of prolonged-release versus immediate-release exenatide in \ncombination with diet and exercise alone, metformin and/or sulphonylurea and metformin \nand/or thiazolidinedione (intent to treat patients)\n\n24-Week Study Prolonged-\nrelease \nexenatide 2 mg \n\nImmediate-\nrelease \nexenatide \n10 mcg twice \ndaily\n\nN 129 123\nMean HbA1c (%)\nBaseline 8.5 8.4\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -1.6 (\u00b10.1)** -0.9 (\u00b10.1)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.67 (-0.94, -0.39)**\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c < 7% 58 30\nChange in fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) (\u00b1 SE) -1.4 (\u00b10.2) -0.3 (\u00b10.2)\nMean body weight (kg)\nBaseline 97 94\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -2.3 (\u00b10.4) -1.4 (\u00b1 0.4)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.95 (-1.91, 0.01)\n\n30-Week Study\n\nN 148 147\nMean HbA1c (%)\nBaseline 8.3 8.3\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -1.9 (\u00b10.1)* -1.5 (\u00b10.1)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.33 (-0.54, -0.12)*\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c \u2264 7% 73 57\nChange in fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) (\u00b1 SE) -2.3 (\u00b10.2) -1.4 (\u00b10.2)\nMean body weight (kg)\nBaseline 102 102\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -3.7 (\u00b10.5) -3.6 (\u00b10.5)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.08 (-1.29, 1.12)\n\nSE = standard error, CI = confidence interval, * p < 0.05, **p < 0.0001\n\nA study of 26-week duration has been conducted, in which prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg is \ncompared to insulin glargine once daily.

A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release exenatide\n2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 inhibitors. \nPatients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median \ntreatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and \n98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. The mean \nage at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients \u2265 75 years). Approximately 62% of the \n\n\n\n17\n\npatients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. \nThe mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate [eGFR] \u2265 60 to \u2264 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR \n\u2265 30 to \u2264 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior CV event, 73.1% had \nat least one prior CV event.\n\nThe primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to \nfirst confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint \nassessed. \nProlonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; \nP < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR \nfor MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77\u20130.97) in patients with baseline eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and \n1.01 (95% CI: 0.86\u20131.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

A reduction in HbA1c was observed over \nthe course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. \nplacebo).\n\nBody weight\nA reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in all prolonged-release exenatide \nstudies. In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, this reduction in body weight was seen in patients \ntreated with prolonged-release exenatide irrespective of the occurrence of nausea although the \nreduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -2.9 kg to -5.2 kg with nausea \nversus -2.2 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea). \n\nIn the 4 comparator-controlled studies, the proportion of patients who had both a reduction in weight \nand HbA1c ranged from 70 to 79% (the proportion of patients who had a reduction of HbA1c ranged \nfrom 88 to 96%). \n\nPlasma/serum glucose\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum \nglucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled \nstudy with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose \nwas -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. \nAdditional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. The improvement in fasting \nplasma glucose concentrations was durable through 52 weeks.\n\nBeta-cell function\nClinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide have indicated improved beta-cell function, using \nmeasures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The durability of effect on beta-cell \nfunction was maintained through 52 weeks.\n\nBlood pressure\nA reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the 4 comparator-controlled prolonged-release \nexenatide studies (2.9 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator \nstudy both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood \npressure from base line (4.7\u00b11.1 mmHg and 3.4\u00b11.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the \ntreatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.\n\nIn the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic \nblood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the \nplacebo group.\n\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a \nsignificant mean change reduction of -4.3\u00b10.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to \nprolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2\u00b10.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8\u00b10.8\nmmHg (p < 0.05).\n\nFasting lipids\nProlonged-release exenatide has shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. \n\n\n\n19\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nprolonged-release exenatide in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release \nexenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated \naccording to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing weekly administration of 2 mg prolonged-release exenatide, mean exenatide concentrations \nexceeded minimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the \naverage plasma exenatide concentration over 6 to 7 weeks. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of \napproximately 151-265 pg/mL were maintained indicating that steady state was achieved. Steady-state \nexenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with minimal \npeak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a \nsingle dose of exenatide is 28 L.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nNonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration \nwith subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These \npharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks \nafter discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations \nfell below minimal detectable concentrations.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of renal impaired patients receiving 2 mg prolonged-release \nexenatide indicate that there may be an increase in systemic exposure of approximately 74% and 23% \n(median prediction in each group) in moderate (N = 10) and mild (N = 56) renal impaired patients, \nrespectively as compared to normal (N = 84) renal function patients. \n\nHepatic insufficiency\nNo pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is \ncleared primarily by the kidney; therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood \nconcentrations of exenatide.\n\nGender, race and body weight\nGender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. \n\nElderly\nData in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age \nup to about 75 years old.\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, \nadministration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 \nelderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to \nreduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in 13 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes and between the ages of 12 and 16 years, administration of exenatide (5 mcg) resulted in \n\n\n\n20\n\nslightly lower mean AUC (16% lower) and Cmax (25% lower) compared to those observed in adults. \nNo pharmacokinetics study of prolonged-release exenatide has been conducted in the paediatric \npopulation.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release exenatide or \nprolonged-release exenatide. \n\nThyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a \n2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell \nadenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses \u2265 2-fold the human systemic exposure based \non AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown.\n\nAnimal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of \nexenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBydureon 2 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach pre-filled pen contains 2 mg of exenatide. After suspension, each pen delivers a dose of 2 mg in \n0.65 mL.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection.\n\nPowder: white to off-white powder.\nSolvent: clear, colourless to pale yellow to pale brown solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic \ncontrol in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when \nthe therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. \n\nPatients switching from immediate-release (Byetta) to prolonged-release (Bydureon or Bydureon \nBCise) exenatide may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, which \ngenerally improve within the first two weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching between the \nprolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no expected \nrelevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, \nthe current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to \nsulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day \nof weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least \nthree days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without \nmeals.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly \nscheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly \ndosing schedule. \n\n\n\n23\n\nIf a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not \nadminister the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly \nscheduled dosing day.\n\nThe use of prolonged-release exenatide does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose \nself-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when \nprolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin \ndose reduction is recommended.\n\nIf a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release \nexenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the product (see section 5.2).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, \nconsideration should be given to the patient\u2019s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nProlonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or \nsevere renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of prolonged-release exenatide in children and adolescents aged under \n18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nSubcutaneous use\nProlonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each pen can only be used by one \nperson and is for single use. \n\nPrior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and \ncaregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d, provided in the \ncarton, must be followed carefully.\n\nEach dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a \nsubcutaneous injection immediately after suspension of the powder in the solvent. \n\nWhen used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate \ninjections.\n\nFor instructions on the suspension of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the \ntreatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n\n\n24\n\nProlonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in \ninsulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). \n\nProlonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide \nincreased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release \nexenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal \nimpairment (GFR < 30mL/min). \n\nThere have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum \ncreatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes \nrequiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect \nhydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to \naffect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin \nconverting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal \nproducts and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive \ntreatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.\n\nSevere gastrointestinal disease\nProlonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, \nincluding gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, \nincluding nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of prolonged-release exenatide is not \nrecommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In \nclinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% of patients. There \nhave been spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. \nResolution of pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of \nnecrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed \nof the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, prolonged-release exenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \nprolonged-release exenatide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a \nhistory of pancreatitis. \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \nThe concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide with D-phenylalanine derivatives (meglitinides), \nalpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor agonists has \nnot been studied. The concurrent use of prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide has not\nbeen studied and is not recommended.\n\nInteraction with warfarin\nThere have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio), \nsometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination \nwith a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a \nsulphonylurea combination, with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia \ncompared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with \nthe use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.\n\nRapid weight loss\n\n\n\n25\n\nRapid weight loss at a rate of > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. \nWeight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.\n\nDiscontinuation of treatment\nAfter discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of \nexenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be \nconsidered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist \nuntil exenatide levels decline.\n\nExcipients\nSodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSulphonylureas\nThe dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia \nassociated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nGastric emptying\nThe results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of \nprolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically \nsignificant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral \nmedicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric \nemptying are required.\n\nWhen 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following \n14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were \nobserved compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) \nand tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and \n1.3 hours (fed). \n\nThe following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but \nnot prolonged-release exenatide:\n\nWarfarin\nA delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after \nimmediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased \nINR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release \nexenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in \npatients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nHydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors\nLovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was \ndelayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single \ndose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide \nand HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see \nsection 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be \nmonitored as appropriate.\n\nDigoxin and lisinopril\nIn interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were \nno clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed.\n\n\n\n26\n\nEthinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel\nAdministration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg \nlevonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of \neither ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after \nexenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and \nCmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The \nreduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is \nrequired.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nDue to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential \nshould use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicinal product \nshould be discontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is \nrecommended. \n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be \nused during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nNo fertility studies in humans have been conducted.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nProlonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When\nprolonged-release exenatide is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to \ntake precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea which was the most \nfrequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over time, and \ndiarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia (with a \nsulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release \nexenatide were mild to moderate in intensity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and \nspontaneous reports (not observed in clinical studies, frequency not known) are summarised in Table 1 \nbelow. \n\nIn the prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies, background therapies included diet and exercise, \nmetformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering medicinal \nproducts or a basal insulin. \n\n\n\n27\n\nThe reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and \nspontaneous reports\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nDrug-induced \nthrombocytopenia\n\nX4\n\nImmune system disorders\nAnaphylactic reaction X1\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nHypoglycaemia (with \na sulphonylurea)\n\nX1\n\nHypoglycaemia (with \ninsulin)\n\nX2,3\n\nDecreased appetite X1\n\nDehydration X1\n\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache X1\n\nDizziness X1\n\nDysgeusia X1\n\nSomnolence X1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nIntestinal obstruction X1\n\nAcute pancreatitis (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nX1\n\nNausea X1\n\nVomiting X1\n\nDiarrhoea X1\n\nDyspepsia X1\n\nAbdominal pain X1\n\nGastroesophageal \nreflux disease\n\nX1\n\nAbdominal distension X1\n\nEructation X1\n\nConstipation X1\n\nFlatulence X1\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nMacular and papular \nrash\n\nX4\n\nPruritus, and/ or \nurticaria\n\nX1\n\nAngioneurotic oedema X4\n\nInjection site abscesses \nand cellulitis\n\nX4\n\nHyperhidrosis X1\n\n\n\n28\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nAlopecia X1\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nAltered renal function, \nincluding acute renal \nfailure, worsened \nchronic renal failure, \nrenal impairment, \nincreased serum \ncreatinine (see section \n4.4).\n\nX1\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site pruritus X1\n\nFatigue X1\n\nInjection site erythema X1\n\nInjection site rash X1\n\nAsthenia X1\n\nFeeling jittery X1\n\nInvestigations\nInternational \nnormalised ratio \nincreased (see section \n4.4)\n\nX4\n\n1 Rate based on twelve prolonged-release exenatide completed long-term efficacy and safety studies \nn=2868 total (patients on sulphonylurea n=1002).\n2 Based on hypoglycaemic events that 1.

DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by drug-\ndependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the presence \nof the sensitizing drug.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea (24.0% versus 5.4%) (see section 4.4). To reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may \nbe considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide was associated with a significantly lower incidence of episodes of \nhypoglycaemia than basal insulin in patients also receiving metformin therapy (3% versus 19%) and in \npatients also receiving metformin plus sulphonylurea therapy (20% versus 42%).\n\n\n\n29\n\nAcross 12 studies of prolonged-release exenatide most episodes (99.9% n = 649) of hypoglycaemia \nwere minor, and resolved with oral administration of carbohydrate. One patient was reported with \nmajor hypoglycaemia since he had a low blood glucose value (2.2 mmol/L) and requested assistance \nwith oral carbohydrate treatment which resolved the event.\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin \nwas required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically \nsignificant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no \nepisodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.\n\nNausea\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction was nausea. In patients treated with prolonged-release \nexenatide, generally 20% reported at least one episode of nausea compared to 34% of \nimmediate-release exenatide patients. Most episodes of nausea were mild to moderate. With continued \ntherapy, the frequency decreased in most patients who initially experienced nausea.\n\nThe incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events during the 30-week controlled study was 6% for \nprolonged-release exenatide treated patients, 5% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. The \nmost common adverse events leading to withdrawal in either treatment group were nausea and \nvomiting. Withdrawal due to nausea or vomiting each occurred in < 1% for prolonged-release \nexenatide treated patients and 1% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients.\n\nInjection site reactions\nInjection site reactions were observed more frequently in prolonged-release exenatide treated patients \nversus comparator-treated patients (16% versus range of 2-7%) during the 6-month controlled phase of \nstudies. These injection site reactions were generally mild and usually did not lead to withdrawal from \nstudies. Patients may be treated to relieve symptoms, while continuing treatment. Subsequent \ninjections should use a different site of injection each week. In postmarketing experiences, cases with \ninjection site abscesses and cellulitis have been reported.\n\nSmall subcutaneous injection site nodules were observed very frequently in clinical studies, consistent \nwith the known properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most \nindividual nodules were asymptomatic, did not interfere with study participation and resolved over 4 \nto 8 weeks.\n\nImmunogenicity\nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, \npatients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. In \nmost patients who develop antibodies, antibody titres diminish over time. \n\nThe presence of antibodies (high or low titres) is not predictive of glycaemic control for an individual \npatient.\n\nIn clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, approximately 45% of patients had low titre \nantibodies to exenatide at study endpoint. Overall the percentage of antibody positive patients was \nconsistent across clinical studies. Overall, the level of glycaemic control (HbA1c) was comparable to \nthat observed in those without antibody titres. On average in the phase 3 studies, 12% of the patients \nhad higher titre antibodies. In a proportion of these the glycaemic response to prolonged-release \nexenatide was absent at the end of the controlled period of studies; 2.6% of patients showed no \nglucose improvement with higher titre antibodies whereas 1.6% showed no improvement while \nantibody negative.\n\nPatients who developed antibodies to exenatide tend to have more injection site reactions (for \nexample: redness of skin and itching), but otherwise similar rates and types of adverse events as those \nwith no antibodies to exenatide.\n\n\n\n30\n\nFor prolonged-release exenatide treated patients, the incidence of potentially immunogenic injection \nsite reactions (most commonly pruritus with or without erythema) during the 30-week and the two \n26-week studies was 9%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative patients \n(4%) compared with antibody-positive patients (13%), with a greater incidence in those with higher\ntitre antibodies.\n\nExamination of antibody-positive specimens revealed no significant cross-reactivity with similar \nendogenous peptides (glucagon or GLP-1).\n\nRapid weight loss\nIn a 30-week study, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated patients \nexperienced at least one time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between two \nconsecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week). \n\nIncreased heart rate\nA mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was \nobserved in pooled prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies. Fifteen percent of prolonged-release \nexenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm; approximately 5% to 10% of \nsubjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nEffects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included \nsevere nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of \noverdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient\u2019s clinical signs \nand symptoms. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC \ncode: A10BJ01.\n\nMechanism of action\nExenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several \nantihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of \nexenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate \nthe known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or \nother intracellular signalling pathways. \n\nExenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. \nAs blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in \ncombination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a \nthiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section \n4.4).\n\nExenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31\n\nHowever, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to \nhypoglycaemia. \n\nExenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in \nthe circulation. \n\nAdministration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and \nincreased satiety.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nExenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and \nfasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-\nrelease exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once \nweekly administration.\n\nA pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a \nrestoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to \nan intravenous bolus of glucose.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe results of long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide are presented below; these \nstudies comprised 1356 subjects treated with prolonged-release exenatide, 52% men and 48% women, \n230 subjects (17%) were \u2265 65 years of age.\n\nIn addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled \n14,752 subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care.\n\nGlycaemic control\nIn two studies prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly has been compared to immediate-release \nexenatide 5 mcg given twice daily for 4 weeks followed by immediate-release exenatide 10 mcg given \ntwice daily. One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 30 weeks (n = 295) \nfollowed by an open-labelled extension where all patients were treated with prolonged-release \nexenatide 2 mg once weekly for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, decreases in HbA1c were \nevident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c measurement (Weeks 4 or \n6).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to \npatients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 2).\n\nA clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated \nsubjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.\n\nClinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to \nimmediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of \u2264 7% or < 7% in the two studies \n(p < 0.05 and p \u2264 0.0001, respectively).\n\nBoth prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight \ncompared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. \n\nIn the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to \nprolonged-release exenatide at Week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% \nat Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.\nFor all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients \nincluded in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from Week 52 onwards, but \nwas still reduced compared to baseline after 7 years (-1.5%). Weight loss was sustained over 7 years in \nthese patients.\n\n\n\n32\n\nTable 2: Results of two studies of prolonged-release versus immediate-release exenatide in \ncombination with diet and exercise alone, metformin and/or sulphonylurea and metformin \nand/or thiazolidinedione (intent to treat patients)\n\n24-Week Study Prolonged-\nrelease \nexenatide 2 mg\n\nImmediate-\nrelease\nexenatide \n10 mcg twice \ndaily\n\nN 129 123\nMean HbA1c (%)\nBaseline 8.5 8.4\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -1.6 (\u00b10.1)** -0.9 (\u00b10.1)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.67 (-0.94, -0.39)**\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c < 7% 58 30\nChange in fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) (\u00b1 SE) -1.4 (\u00b10.2) -0.3 (\u00b10.2)\nMean body weight (kg)\nBaseline 97 94\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -2.3 (\u00b10.4) -1.4 (\u00b1 0.4)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.95 (-1.91, 0.01)\n\n30-Week Study\n\nN 148 147\nMean HbA1c (%)\nBaseline 8.3 8.3\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -1.9 (\u00b10.1)* -1.5 (\u00b10.1)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95 % CI)\n\n-0.33 (-0.54, -0.12)*\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c \u2264 7% 73 57\nChange in fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) (\u00b1 SE) -2.3 (\u00b10.2) -1.4 (\u00b10.2)\nMean body weight (kg)\nBaseline 102 102\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE) -3.7 (\u00b10.5) -3.6 (\u00b10.5)\nMean difference change from baseline between \ntreatments (95% CI)\n\n-0.08 (-1.29, 1.12)\n\nSE = standard error, CI = confidence interval, * p < 0.05, **p < 0.0001\n\nA study of 26-week duration has been conducted, in which prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg is \ncompared to insulin glargine once daily.

A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release exenatide\n2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 inhibitors. \nPatients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median \ntreatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and \n98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. The mean \nage at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients \u2265 75 years). Approximately 62% of the \npatients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. \nThe mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular \n\n\n\n37\n\nfiltration rate [eGFR] \u2265 60 to \u2264 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR \n\u2265 30 to \u2264 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior CV event, 73.1% had \nat least one prior CV event.\n\nThe primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to \nfirst confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint \nassessed. \nProlonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; \nP < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR \nfor MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77\u20130.97) in patients with baseline eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and \n1.01 (95% CI: 0.86\u20131.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

A reduction in HbA1c was observed over \nthe course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. \nplacebo).\n\nBody weight\nA reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in all prolonged-release exenatide \nstudies. In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, this reduction in body weight was seen in patients \ntreated with prolonged-release exenatide irrespective of the occurrence of nausea although the \nreduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -2.9 kg to -5.2 kg with nausea \nversus -2.2 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea).\n\nIn the 4 comparator-controlled studies, the proportion of patients who had both a reduction in weight \nand HbA1c ranged from 70 to 79% (the proportion of patients who had a reduction of HbA1c ranged \nfrom 88 to 96%). \n\nPlasma/serum glucose\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum \nglucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled \nstudy with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose \nwas -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. \nAdditional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. The improvement in fasting \nplasma glucose concentrations was durable through 52 weeks.\n\nBeta-cell function \nClinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide have indicated improved beta-cell function, using \nmeasures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The durability of effect on beta-cell \nfunction was maintained through 52 weeks.\n\nBlood pressure\nA reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the 4 comparator-controlled prolonged-release \nexenatide studies (2.9 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator \nstudy both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood \npressure from baseline (4.7\u00b11.1 mmHg and 3.4\u00b11.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the \ntreatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.\n\nIn the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic \nblood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the \nplacebo group.\n\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a \nsignificant mean change reduction of -4.3\u00b10.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to \nprolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2\u00b10.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8\u00b10.8\nmmHg (p < 0.05).\n\nFasting lipids\nProlonged-release exenatide has shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. \n\n\n\n39\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nprolonged-release exenatide in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release \nexenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated \naccording to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing weekly administration of 2 mg prolonged-release exenatide, mean exenatide concentrations \nexceeded minimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the \naverage plasma exenatide concentration over 6 to 7 weeks. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of \napproximately 151-265 pg/mL were maintained indicating that steady state was achieved. Steady-state \nexenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with minimal \npeak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a \nsingle dose of exenatide is 28 L.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nNonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration \nwith subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These \npharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks \nafter discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations \nfell below minimal detectable concentrations.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of renal impaired patients receiving 2 mg prolonged-release \nexenatide indicate that there may be an increase in systemic exposure of approximately 74% and 23% \n(median prediction in each group) in moderate (N = 10) and mild (N = 56) renal impaired patients, \nrespectively, as compared to normal (N = 84) renal function patients. \n\nHepatic insufficiency\nNo pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is \ncleared primarily by the kidney, therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood \nconcentrations of exenatide.\n\nGender, race and body weight\nGender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. \n\nElderly\nData in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age \nup to about 75 years old. \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, \nadministration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 \nelderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to \nreduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in 13 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes and between the ages of 12 and 16 years, administration of exenatide (5 mcg) resulted in \n\n\n\n40\n\nslightly lower mean AUC (16% lower) and Cmax (25% lower) compared to those observed in adults. \nNo pharmacokinetics study of prolonged-release exenatide has been conducted in the paediatric \npopulation.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release or \nprolonged-release exenatide. \n\nThyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a \n2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell \nadenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses \u2265 2-fold the human systemic exposure based \non AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown.\n\nAnimal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of \nexenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBydureon 2 mg prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach pre-filled pen delivers a dose of 2 mg of exenatide in 0.85 mL.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen (BCise).\n\nWhite to off-white opaque suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic \ncontrol in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when \nthe therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nFor study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, \nand the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. \n\nPatients switching from immediate-release exenatide (Byetta) to prolonged-release exenatide \n(Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, \nwhich generally improve within the first four weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching \nbetween the prolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no \nexpected relevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, \nthe current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to \nsulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day \nof weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least \nthree days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without \nmeals. \n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly \nscheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly \ndosing schedule. \n\n\n\n44\n\nIf a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not \nadminister the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly \nscheduled dosing day.\n\nThe use of this medicinal product does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose self-\nmonitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when \nprolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin \ndose reduction is recommended. \n\nIf a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release \nexenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the product (see section 5.2).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, \nconsideration should be given to the patient\u2019s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n\nProlonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or \nsevere renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of prolonged-release exenatide in children and adolescents aged under 18 \nyears have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nSubcutaneous use\nProlonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each pen can only be used by one \nperson and is for single use. \n\nPrior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and \ncaregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d, provided in the \ncarton, must be followed carefully.\n\nEach dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a \nsubcutaneous injection immediately after the medicinal product is fully mixed. \n\nWhen used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate \ninjections.\n\nFor instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the \ntreatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n\n\n45\n\nProlonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in \ninsulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). \n\nProlonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide \nincreased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release \nexenatide formulations are not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe \nrenal impairment (GFR < 30mL/min). \n\nThere have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum \ncreatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes \nrequiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect \nhydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to \naffect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin \nconverting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal \nproducts and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive \ntreatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.\n\nSevere gastrointestinal disease\nProlonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, \nincluding gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, \nincluding nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of this medicinal product is not \nrecommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In \nclinical studies of Bydureon BCise, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.4% of patients. There have been \nspontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. Resolution of \npancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of necrotising or \nhaemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed of the \ncharacteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, the use of this medicinal product should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \nit should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nConcomitant medicinal products\nThe concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide formulations with D-phenylalanine derivatives \n(meglitinides), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor \nagonists has not been studied. The concurrent use of a formulation of prolonged-release and \nimmediate-release exenatide has not been studied and is not recommended.\n\nInteraction with warfarin\nThere have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio), \nsometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination \nwith a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a \nsulphonylurea combination with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia \ncompared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with \nthe use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.\n\nRapid weight loss\nRapid weight loss at a rate of > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. \nWeight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.\n\n\n\n46\n\nDiscontinuation of treatment\nAfter discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of \nexenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be \nconsidered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist \nuntil exenatide levels decline.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSulphonylureas\nThe dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia \nassociated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nGastric emptying\nThe results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of \nprolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically \nsignificant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral \nmedicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric \nemptying are required.\n\nWhen 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following \n14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were \nobserved compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) \nand tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and \n1.3 hours (fed). \n\nThe following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but \nnot prolonged-release exenatide formulations:\n\nWarfarin\nA delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after \nimmediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased \nINR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release \nexenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in \npatients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nHydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors\nLovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was \ndelayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single \ndose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide \nand HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see \nsection 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be \nmonitored as appropriate.\n\nDigoxin and lisinopril\nIn interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were \nno clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed. \n\nEthinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel\nAdministration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg \nlevonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of \neither ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after \nexenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and \nCmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The \nreduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is \nrequired.\n\n\n\n47\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nDue to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential \nshould use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicine should be \ndiscontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nProlonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is \nrecommended. \n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be \nused during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nNo fertility studies in humans have been conducted.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nProlonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When used \nin combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid \nhypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions during the clinical studies were gastrointestinal-related (mainly \nnausea (8%), which tended to dissipate with continued treatment), headache (4%) and injection site \nreactions, such as injection site pruritus (3%) and injection site erythema (2%). In addition, \nhypoglycaemia with a sulphonylurea occurred very commonly (see Description of selected adverse \nreactions, below). Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of adverse reactions of Bydureon BCise identified from clinical studies are summarised \nin Table 1 below.\n\nThe pooled clinical studies data set for Bydureon BCise comprises two phase 3 comparator-controlled \nstudies of 6 to 12 months duration. The follow-up and extension phases of studies are included in the \npool. Background therapies included diet and exercise alone or with metformin, a sulphonylurea, a \nthiazolidinedione or a combination of oral glucose-lowering medicinal products. Adverse reactions \nthat have been observed with the prolonged-release exenatide but not in clinical studies with Bydureon \nBCise are also included in Table 1. \n\nBackground therapies in the prolonged-release exenatide clinical trials included diet and exercise, \nmetformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering agents or a \nbasal insulin. \n\nThe reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c 1/10), \n\n\n\n48\n\nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions of Bydureon BCise identified from clinical studies\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence1\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\nDrug-induced \nthrombocytopenia9\n\nX\n\nImmune system disorders\nAnaphylactic reaction2 X\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nHypoglycaemia (with \na sulphonylurea)5,6,7\n\nX\n\nHypoglycaemia \n(without a \nsulphonylurea)5,6,7\n\nX\n\nHypoglycaemia (with \ninsulin)3,4,5\n\nX\n\nDecreased appetite X\nDehydration X\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache X\nDizziness X\nDysgeusia X\nSomnolence2 X\nGastrointestinal disorders\nNausea5 X\nDiarrhoea X\nVomiting X\nConstipation X\nDyspepsia X\nGastroesophageal \nreflux disease\n\nX\n\nAbdominal distension X\nAbdominal pain X\nFlatulence X\nAcute pancreatitis (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nX\n\nEructation2 X\nIntestinal obstruction2 X\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nUrticaria X\nHyperhidrosis X\nMacular or papular \nrash\n\nX\n\nPruritus X\nAlopecia2 X\nAngioedema 9 X\n\n\n\n49\n\nSystem organ class \n/adverse reaction \nterms\n\nFrequency of occurrence1\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not \nknown\n\nInjection site abscesses \nand cellulitis9\n\nX\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nAltered renal function8 X\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site pruritus5 X\nInjection site \nerythema5\n\nX\n\nFatigue X\nInjection site reaction5 X\nAsthenia X\nInjection site rash5 X\nFeeling jittery2 X\nInvestigations\n\nInternational \nnormalised ratio \nincreased9 (see section \n4.4)\n\nX\n\n1 Rate based on completed long-term safety and efficacy studies (n = 526), unless other indicated. \nIncludes follow-up within seventy days of the last dose received and extension period. \n2 Rate based on twelve prolonged-release exenatide completed long-term efficacy and safety studies \nn = 2868 total. \n3 Based on hypoglycaemic events that 1.

See section 4.4.\n9 Rate based on prolonged-release exenatide spontaneous reports data (unknown denominator). \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia \nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) with exenatide-dependent anti-platelet antibodies has been \nreported in the postmarketing setting. DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by drug-\ndependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the presence \nof the sensitizing drug.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThere were no events of major hypoglycaemia with Bydureon BCise. The overall incidence of minor \nhypoglycaemia was 6.3%. This incidence was increased when it was used in combination with a \nsulphonylurea (26.1%) compared to no sulphonylurea (0.9%) (see section 4.4). To reduce the risk of \n\n\n\n50\n\nhypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may \nbe considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nWhen prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin \nwas required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically \nsignificant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no \nepisodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.\n\nNausea\nThe most frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse reaction was nausea. During the controlled \nperiod of the clinical study comparing Bydureon BCise with immediate-release exenatide, nausea was \nreported in 9.6% and 20.5% of patients in each group. Overall, 9.3% of patients treated with Bydureon \nBCise reported nausea during the controlled period of both clinical studies. Most episodes of nausea \nwere mild to moderate, associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over time.\n\nInjection site reactions\nDuring the controlled period of the clinical studies, injection site reactions were observed more \nfrequently in patients treated with Bydureon BCise versus comparator-treated patients (24% versus 4% \nwith immediate-release exenatide). These injection site reactions were generally mild and usually did \nnot lead to discontinuation of study medication. Patients may be treated to relieve symptoms, while \ncontinuing treatment. Subsequent injections should use a different site of injection each week. In \npostmarketing experience with prolonged-release exenatide, cases with injection site abscesses and \ncellulitis have been reported.\n\nSubcutaneous injection site nodules were observed frequently in clinical studies, consistent with the \nknown properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most \nindividual nodules did not interfere with study participation and resolved over time.\n\nImmunogenicity\nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, \npatients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. \n\nApproximately 42% of patients developed low titre antibodies to exenatide and 32% of patients \ndeveloped high titre antibodies at any time during the studies. The percentage of these subjects with \npositive antibody titres, in particular high titres, peaked at approximately weeks 8 to 16 of dosing and \nthen diminished over time. At the study endpoint, approximately 43% of patients had low titre \nantibodies to exenatide and 14% of patients had high titre antibodies. Overall, the level of glycaemic \ncontrol (HbA1c) in patients treated with Bydureon BCise with low titre antibodies at the last visit \n(-1.1% to -1.5%) was comparable to that observed in those without antibody titres (-1.1% to -1.4%). \nWhile patients with high titre antibodies at the last visit had an attenuated HbA1c response, HbA1c\nreductions in these patients were clinically relevant (-0.6% to -0.7%).\n\nAmongst patients treated with Bydureon BCise evaluable for antibodies (N = 393), the incidence of \npotentially immunogenic injection site reactions (most commonly injection site nodule) during the two \nstudies was approximately 20%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative \npatients (16%) and patients with low titre antibodies (16%) compared with those with high titre \nantibodies (27%).\n\nRapid weight loss\nIn a 30-week study, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated patients \nexperienced at least one-time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between two \nconsecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week).\n\nIncreased heart rate\nA mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.4 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was \nobserved in the controlled period of the Bydureon BCise clinical studies. Fifteen percent of \n\n\n\n51\n\nprolonged-release exenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm; approximately \n5% to 10% of subjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of \u2265 10 bpm.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nEffects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included \nsevere nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of \noverdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient\u2019s clinical signs \nand symptoms. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC \ncode: A10BJ01.\n\nMechanism of action\nExenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several \nantihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of \nexenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate \nthe known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or \nother intracellular signalling pathways. \n\nExenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. \nAs blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in \ncombination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a \nthiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section \n4.4).\n\nExenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. \nHowever, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to \nhypoglycaemia. \n\nExenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in \nthe circulation.\n\nAdministration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and \nincreased satiety.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nExenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and \nfasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-\nrelease exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once \nweekly administration.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n52\n\nA pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a \nrestoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to \nan intravenous bolus of glucose.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe results of two studies with Bydureon BCise and six long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release \nexenatide are presented below; these studies comprised 1766 subjects (556 treated with Bydureon \nBCise), 53% men and 47% women, 304 subjects (17%) were \u2265 65 years of age.\n\nIn addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled \n14,752 subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care.\n\nGlycaemic control\nBydureon BCise\n\nIn a 28-week open-label study, Bydureon BCise was compared to immediate-release exenatide in \nsubjects on a diet and exercise programme alone or with a stable regimen of oral glucose-lowering \nmedicinal products. Both treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. Bydureon \nBCise demonstrated superiority to immediate-release exenatide in reducing HbA1c from baseline to \nWeek 28 (Table 2). The 28-week comparator-controlled period of the study was followed by a \n24-week extension period during which all participating subjects received treatment with this \nmedicinal product. The effect on HbA1c remained clinically significant over 52 weeks but partially \ndiminished over time in the group that had initially received Bydureon BCise.\n\nBoth Bydureon BCise and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight at \nWeek 28 compared to baseline (Table 2). The difference between the two treatment groups was not \nsignificant. The reductions in body weight were sustained at Week 52.\n\nTable 2: Results of one 28-week study of Bydureon BCise versus immediate-release exenatide \nwith diet and exercise alone or with a stable regimen of oral glucose-lowering medicinal \nproducts (modified intent to treat patients1)\n\nBydureon BCise 2 mg \nQW\n\nImmediate-release \nexenatide 10 mcg \nBID\n\nN 229 146\nMean HbA1c (%)\nBaseline 8.5 8.5\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE)2 -1.4 (\u00b10.1) -1.0 (\u00b10.1)\nMean difference in change from baseline \nversus immediate-release exenatide (95% \nCI)2\n\n-0.37*\n(-0.63, -0.10)\n\nPatients (%) achieving HbA1c < 7%3 49 43\nMean body weight (kg)\nBaseline 97 97\nChange from baseline (\u00b1 SE)2 -1.5 (\u00b10.3) -1.9 (\u00b10.4)\nMean difference in change from baseline \nversus immediate-release exenatide (95% \nCI)2\n\n+0.40\n(-0.48, 1.28)\n\nMean change from baseline in fasting plasma \nglucose (mmol/L) (\u00b1 SE)2\n\n-1.8 (\u00b10.2) -1.3 (\u00b10.3)\n\nMean difference in change from baseline \nversus immediate-release exenatide (95% \nCI)2\n\n-0.56\n(-1.20, 0.08)\n\nQW = once weekly, BID = twice daily, N = number of patients per treatment group, SE = standard \nerror, CI = confidence interval.\n*p-value < 0.01.\n\n\n\n53\n\n1 All randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication.\n2 Least squares means.\n3 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).\n\nIn a 28-week open-label study (oral medication-blinded), Bydureon BCise was compared to sitagliptin \nand placebo in subjects also using metformin \u2265 1,500 mg daily.

One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 30 weeks (n = 295) \nfollowed by an open labelled extension where all patients were treated with prolonged-release \nexenatide 2 mg once weekly, for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, decreases in HbA1c were \nevident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c measurement (Weeks 4 or \n6).\n\n\n\n54\n\nProlonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to \npatients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 4).\n\nA clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated \nsubjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.\n\nClinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to \nimmediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of \u2264 7% or < 7% in the two studies \n(p < 0.05 and p \u2264 0.0001, respectively). \n\nBoth prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight \ncompared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. \n\nIn the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to \nprolonged-release exenatide at week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% \nat Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.\nFor all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients \nincluded in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from week 52 onwards, but was \nstill reduced compared to baseline after 7 years -1.5%).

A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release exenatide\n2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 inhibitors. \nPatients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median \ntreatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and \n98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. The mean \nage at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients \u2265 75 years). Approximately 62% of the \npatients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. \n\n\n\n59\n\nThe mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate [eGFR] \u2265 60 to \u2264 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR \n\u2265 30 to \u2264 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior CV event, 73.1% had \nat least one prior CV event.\n\nThe primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to \nfirst confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint \nassessed. \nProlonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; \nP < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR \nfor MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77\u20130.97) in patients with baseline eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and \n1.01 (95% CI: 0.86\u20131.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The results of the \nprimary composite and secondary cardiovascular endpoints are shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 1: Time to First Adjudicated MACE (intent to treat patients) \n\nHR=hazard ratio, CI=confidence interval\n\nFigure 2: Forest Plot: Analysis of Primary and Secondary Endpoints (intent to treat patients)\n\nMACE\n\nAll-cause death\n\nCV-related death\n\nMyocardial Infarction\n\nStroke\n\nHospitalisation for ACS\n\nHospitalisation for HF\n\nHazard Ratio    Exenatide Placebo\n\nn (%)                    Event Rate      n (%)                     Event Rate   HR (95% CI)1\n\n       <-Exenatide favored-     -Placebo favored->\n\n)\n\n         Exenatide\n         Placebo\n\nExenatide vs Placebo:\nHR (95% CI)                 0.91 (0.832, 1.004)\n\nNumber at Risk\nMonths from Randomization\n\nP\nat\n\nie\nnt\n\ns \nw\n\nit\nh \n\nan\n E\n\nve\nnt\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nExenatide\n\nPlacebo\n\n\n\n60\n\nACS=acute coronary syndrome; CI=confidence interval; CV=cardiovascular; HF=heart failure; HR=hazard \nratio; MACE=major adverse cardiac event; MI=myocardial infarction; n=number of patients with an event; \nN=number of patients in treatment group.\n\n1 HR (active/placebo) and CI are based on Cox proportional hazards regression model, stratified by prior CV \nevent, with treatment group only as explanatory variable.\n\nThe need for additional antihyperglycaemic medication was reduced by 33% with the prolonged-\nrelease exenatide group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 10.5 per 100 pt-year) compared to the placebo \ngroup (exposure-adjusted incidence of 15.7 per 100 pt-year). A reduction in HbA1c was observed over \nthe course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. \nplacebo).\n\nBody weight\nA reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in studies with prolonged-release \nexenatide formulations. This reduction in body weight was seen irrespective of the occurrence of \nnausea although the reduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -1.9 kg \nto -5.2 kg with nausea versus -1.0 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea). \n\nPlasma/serum glucose\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum \nglucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled \nstudy with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose \nwas -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. \nAdditional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. \nFor both prolonged-release exenatide formulations, the improvement in fasting plasma glucose \nconcentrations was sustained through 52 weeks.\n\nBeta-cell function\nClinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide formulations have indicated improved beta-cell \nfunction, using measures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The effect on \nbeta-cell function was sustained through 52 weeks.\n\nBlood pressure\nA reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the studies with prolonged-release exenatide \nformulations (0.8 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator \nstudy both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood \npressure from baseline (4.7\u00b11.1 mmHg and 3.4\u00b11.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the \ntreatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.\n\nIn the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic \nblood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the \nplacebo group.\n\nTreatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a \nsignificant mean change reduction of -4.3\u00b10.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to \nprolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2\u00b10.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8\u00b10.8\nmmHg (p < 0.05).\n\nFasting lipids\nThe prolonged-release exenatide formulations have shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. \n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nprolonged-release exenatide formulations in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n\n\n61\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release \nexenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated \naccording to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing weekly administration of 2 mg Bydureon BCise, mean exenatide concentrations exceeded \nminimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the average \nplasma exenatide concentration up to Week 8. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of \napproximately 153-208 pg/mL were maintained, indicating that steady state was achieved. \nSteady-state exenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with \nminimal peak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a \nsingle dose of exenatide is 28 L.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nNonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration \nwith subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These \npharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks \nafter discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations \nfell below minimal detectable concentrations.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nNo clinically meaningful differences were observed in steady state exenatide concentrations or \ntolerability in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2) \nreceiving Bydureon BCise, compared to those with normal renal function.\n\nHepatic insufficiency\nNo pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is \ncleared primarily by the kidney; therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood \nconcentrations of exenatide.\n\nGender, race and body weight\nGender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. \n\nElderly\nData in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age \nup to about 75 years old.\n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, \nadministration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 \nelderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to\nreduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in 13 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes and between the ages of 12 and 16 years, administration of exenatide (5 mcg) resulted in \nslightly lower mean AUC (16% lower) and Cmax (25% lower) compared to those observed in adults. \nNo pharmacokinetics study of prolonged-release exenatide has been conducted in the paediatric \npopulation.\n\n\n\n62\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release exenatide or \nprolonged-release exenatide formulations.\n\nThyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a \n2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell \nadenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses \u2265 2-fold the human systemic exposure based \non AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown. \n\nAnimal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of \nexenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Bydureon is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon\n3. How to use Bydureon\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Bydureon\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Bydureon is and what it is used for\n\nBydureon contains the active substance exenatide. It is an injectable medicine used to improve blood \nsugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThis medicine is used in combination with the following diabetes medicines: metformin, \nsulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now \nprescribing this medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to \nfollow your food and exercise plan.\n\nYou have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in \nyour blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to \nincrease the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon\n\nDo not use Bydureon:\n- If you are allergic to exenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Bydureon about the following:\n- If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar \n\n(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Test your blood glucose levels regularly. Ask your doctor, \npharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other medicines contain a \nsulphonylurea.\n\n- If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as this medicine should not be used.\n- How to inject this medicine. It should be injected into the skin and not into a vein or into the \n\nmuscle. \n- If you have severe problems with your stomach emptying (including gastroparesis) or food \n\ndigestion, as the use of this medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine \nslows stomach emptying so food passes more slowly through your stomach.\n\n\n\n99\n\n- If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).\n- If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this \n\nmay cause problems such as gallstones.\n- If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not \n\nrecommended.\n\nBydureon is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents less than 18 years, as there is no experience with \nthis medicine in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Bydureon\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, particularly:\n- other medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as medicines that work like \n\nBydureon (for example: liraglutide or other exenatide containing products), as taking these \nmedicines with Bydureon is not recommended.\n\n- medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. Warfarin, as you will require additional \nmonitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with \nthis medicine.\n\n- a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur when \ncombined with Bydureon. \n\n- if you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will \nrecommend that you monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid \nhyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that \noccurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is not known if this medicine may harm your unborn child, therefore you should not use it during \npregnancy and for at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.\n\nIt is not known if exenatide passes into your milk. You should not use this medicine while \nbreast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this \nmedicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can\noccur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this possible problem in \nmind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachines).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Bydureon\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How to use Bydureon\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse has told you. Check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.\n\nYou should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals.\n\n\n\n100\n\nYou should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area \n(abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. Do not inject into a vein or muscle.\n\nEach week you can use the same area of your body. Be sure to choose a different injection site in that \narea.\n\nNever mix insulin and Bydureon together in the same injection. If you need to give yourself both at the \nsame time, use two separate injections. You may give both injections in the same body area (for \nexample, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other.\nTest your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a \nsulphonylurea.\n\nFollow the \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d provided in the carton to inject Bydureon\n\nYour doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the \nfirst time.\n\nCheck that the liquid in the syringe is clear and free of particles before you begin. After mixing, use \nthe suspension only if the mixture is white to off white and cloudy. If you see clumps of dry powder \non the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is NOT mixed well. Shake vigorously again until well \nmixed.\n\nYou should inject this medicine immediately after mixing the powder and the solvent.\n\nUse a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it safely after each use as instructed by \nyour doctor or diabetes nurse. \n\nIf you use more Bydureon than you should\nIf you use more of this medicine than you should, please consult with your doctor first as you may \nneed medical treatment. Using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or \nsymptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4).\n\nIf you forget to use Bydureon\nYou might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your Bydureon injection. \n\nIf you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose \nas soon as it is possible to do so. For your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day. \nIf you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and \ntake the next one as usual, on the day it is due. You can also change your chosen injection day, as long \nas your last dose was given 3 or more days before. \n\nDo not take two doses of Bydureon within 3 days of each other.\n\nIf you are not sure you have taken the full dose of Bydureon\nIf you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just \ntake it next week as planned.\n\nIf you stop using Bydureon\nIf you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. If you stop using this \nmedicine this can affect your blood sugar levels. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes \nnurse.\n\n\n\n101\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSevere allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have been reported rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 \npeople).\n\nYou should see your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as\n\uf0b7 Swelling of the face, tongue or throat (angioedema)\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity (rashes, itching and rapid swelling of the tissues of the neck, face, mouth or \n\nthroat)\n\uf0b7 Difficulty with swallowing\n\uf0b7 Hives and difficulty with breathing\n\nCases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported uncommonly (may affect \nup to 1 in 100 people ) in patients receiving this medicine. Pancreatitis can be a serious, potentially \nlife-threatening medical condition. \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you have had pancreatitis, gallstones, alcoholism or very high triglycerides. \nThese medical conditions can increase the risk of getting pancreatitis, or getting it again, \nwhether or not you are taking this medicine.\n\n\uf0b7 STOP taking this medicine and contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe and \npersistent stomach pain, with or without vomiting, because you could have an inflamed \npancreas (pancreatitis).\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 nausea (nausea is most common when first starting this medicine, but decreases over time in \n\nmost patients) \n\uf0b7 diarrhoea \n\uf0b7 hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) when taken with a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea.\n\nWhen this medicine is used with a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, episodes of low blood \nsugar (hypoglycaemia, generally mild to moderate) can occur. The dose of your sulphonylurea \nmedicine may need to be reduced while you use this medicine. The signs and symptoms of low blood \nsugar may include headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, confusion, irritability, hunger, fast \nheartbeat, sweating, and feeling jittery.

What Bydureon is and what it is used for\n\nBydureon contains the active substance exenatide. It is an injectable medicine used to improve blood \nsugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThis medicine is used in combination with the following diabetes medicines: metformin, \nsulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now \nprescribing this medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to \nfollow your food and exercise plan\n\nYou have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in \nyour blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to \nincrease the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon\n\nDo not use Bydureon:\n- If you are allergic to exenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Bydureon about the following:\n- If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar \n\n(hypoglycaemia) can occur.

You should not use this medicine while \nbreast-feeding.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this \nmedicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can\noccur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this possible problem in \nmind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachines).\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Bydureon\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n\n\n107\n\n3. How to use Bydureon \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse has told you. Check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.\n\nYou should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals.\n\nYou should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area \n(abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. Do not inject into a vein or muscle.\n\nEach week you can use the same area of your body. Be sure to choose a different injection site in that \narea.\n\nNever mix insulin and Bydureon together in the same injection. If you need to give yourself both at the \nsame time, use two separate injections. You may give both injections in the same body area (for \nexample, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other.\n\nTest your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a \nsulphonylurea.\n\nFollow the \u201cInstructions for the User\u201d provided in the carton to inject Bydureon\n\nYour doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the \nfirst time.\n\nRemove one pen from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.\nCheck that the liquid in the pen is clear and free of particles before you begin.

Using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or \nsymptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4).\n\nIf you forget to use Bydureon \nYou might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your Bydureon injection. \n\nIf you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose \nas soon as it is possible to do so. For your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day.  \nIf you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and \ntake the next one as usual, on the day it is due. You can also change your chosen injection day, as long \nas your last dose was given 3 or more days before. \n\nDo not take two doses of Bydureon within 3 days of each other.\n\nIf you are not sure you have taken the full dose of Bydureon\nIf you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just \ntake it next week as planned.\n\n\n\n108\n\nIf you stop using Bydureon \nIf you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. If you stop using this \nmedicine this can affect your blood sugar levels. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes \nnurse.\n\n4.

Ask your doctor, \npharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other medicines contain a \nsulphonylurea.\n\n- If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as this medicine should not be used.\n- How to inject this medicine. It should be injected into the skin and not into a vein or into the \n\nmuscle. \n- If you have severe problems with your stomach emptying (including gastroparesis) or food \n\ndigestion, as the use of this medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine \nslows stomach emptying so food passes more slowly through your stomach.\n\n\n\n113\n\n- If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).\n- If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this \n\nmay cause problems such as gallstones.\n- If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not \n\nrecommended.\n\nBydureon is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. \n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents less than 18 years, as there is no experience with \nthis medicine in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Bydureon\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, particularly:\n- other medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as medicines that work like \n\nBydureon (for example: liraglutide or other exenatide containing products, as taking these \nmedicines with Bydureon is not recommended.\n\n- medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. Warfarin, as you will require additional \nmonitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with \nthis medicine.\n\n- a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur when \ncombined with Bydureon.\n\n- if you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will \nrecommend that you monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid \nhyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that \noccurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is not known if this medicine may harm your unborn child, therefore you should not use it during \npregnancy and for at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.\n\nIt is not known if exenatide passes into your milk. You should not use this medicine while \nbreast-feeding. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nYou should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this \nmedicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can\noccur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this possible problem in \nmind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachines).\n\n3.

Getting Started\n\n1a Take a single-dose kit from the refrigerator. \n\nPrepare to safely dispose of used needles and syringes. Have what you need ready in order to safely \ndispose of used needles and syringes.\n\n1b Wash your hands.\n\n1c\n\nPeel back the cover to open.\n\nRemove the syringe. The liquid in the syringe should be clear and free of particles. It is okay if there \nare air bubbles.\n\nPlace the needle, vial connector package, vial, and syringe on a clean, flat surface.\n\nSyringe Needles (2)\n\nVial Vial connector\n\n\n\n121\n\nPick up the needle, and twist off the blue cap.\n\nPut the covered needle down. The needle is now prepared. You will need it later.\n\nThere is a spare needle in case you need it.\n\nPick up the vial.\n\nTap the vial several times against a hard surface to loosen the powder.\n\nUse your thumb to remove the green cap.\n\nPut the vial down.\n\n1d\n\nTap!\n\n1e\n\n1f\n\n\n\n122\n\n2. Connecting the parts\n\nPick up the vial connector package and peel off the paper cover. Do not touch the orange \nconnector inside.\n\nHold the vial connector package.\nIn your other hand, hold the vial. \n\n2a\n\n2b\n\n2c\n\n\n\n123\n\nPress the top of the vial firmly into the orange connector.\n\nLift the vial with the orange connector now attached out of its package.\n\nThis is what the vial should now look like.\n\nPut it down for later.\n\nPick up the syringe.\n\n2e\n\n2f\n\n2d\n\n\n\n124\n\nWith your other hand, firmly hold the 2 grey squares on the white cap.\n\nBreak off the cap\n\nBe careful not to push in the plunger.\n\nJust like you might break a stick, you are breaking off the cap.\n\nThis is what the broken-off cap looks like.\n\nYou will not need the cap and can throw it away.\n\n2h\n\n2i\n\n2g Snap!\n\n\n\n125\n\nThis is what the syringe should now look like.\n\nNow, pick up the vial with the orange connector attached.\n\nTwist the orange connector onto the syringe until snug. While twisting, be sure to hold the orange \nconnector. Do not over tighten. Be careful not to push in the plunger.\n\nThis is how the parts should now look when they are connected.\n\n3. Mixing the medicine and filling the syringe\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nDuring these next steps, you will be mixing the medicine and filling the syringe. Once you mix \nthe medicine, you must inject it immediately. You must not save the mixed medicine to inject at \na later time. \n\nWith your thumb, push down the plunger until it stops and hold your thumb in place.\n\n2j\n\n2k\n\n3a\n\n\n\n126\n\nThe plunger may feel like it is springing back a little.\n\nKeep pushing down on the plunger with your thumb and shake vigorously. Keep shaking until \nthe liquid and powder are mixed well. \n\nDo not worry that the vial might come off. The orange connector will keep it attached to the syringe.\n\nShake vigorously like you would shake a bottle of oil-and-vinegar salad dressing.\n\nWhen the medicine is mixed well, it should look cloudy.\n\n3b\n\n3c\n\n\n\n127\n\nIf you see clumps of dry powder on the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is NOT mixed \nwell.\n\nShake vigorously again until well mixed.\n\nKeep pushing on the plunger with your thumb while shaking.\n\nNow, hold the vial so the syringe is pointing up. Keep pushing on the plunger with your thumb \nuntil it stops, and hold it in place.\n\nGently tap the vial with the other hand. Keep pushing on the plunger with your thumb to keep \nthe plunger in place.\n\nThe tapping helps the medicine drip down along the sides of the vial. It is okay if there are air bubbles. \n\nPull the plunger down beyond the black dashed Dose Line.\n\nThis draws the medicine from the vial into the syringe. You may see air bubbles. This is normal.\n\nA little bit of liquid may cling to the sides of the vial. This is also normal.\n\n3e\n\n3f\n\n3g\n\n\n\n128\n\nWith one hand, hold the plunger in place so it does not move.\n\nWith the other hand, twist the orange connector to remove.\n\nAfter removing the connector be careful not to push in the plunger.\n\nThis is what the syringe should now look like.\n\n4. Injecting the medicine\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nRead the next steps carefully and look closely at the pictures.\nThis helps you get the correct dose of medicine.\n\n3h\n\n3i\n\n3j\n\n\n\n129\n\nTwist the needle onto the syringe until snug. Do not remove the needle cover yet.\nBe careful not to push in the plunger.\n\nSlowly push in the plunger so the top of the plunger lines up with the black dashed Dose Line.\nThen, take your thumb off the plunger.\n\nIt is important to stop pushing at this point, or you will waste your medicine and you will not get the \ncorrect dose.\n\nThe top of the plunger must stay lined up with the black dashed Dose Line as you go through the \nnext steps. This will help you get the correct dose of medicine.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nIt is normal to see a few air bubbles in the mixture.\nThe air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose.\n\n4a\n\nSlowly \npush\n\nTop of \nplunger\n\n4b\n\n4c\n\n\n\n130\n\nYou can inject each dose of the medicine in your stomach area (abdomen), your thigh, or the \nback of your upper arm.\n\nEach week you can use the same area of your body. But be sure to choose a different injection site in \nthat area.\n\nHold the syringe near the black dashed Dose Line.\n\nPull the needle cover straight off.\nDo not twist.\n\nBe careful not to push in the plunger.\n\nWhen you remove the cover, you may see 1 or 2 drops of liquid. This is normal.\n\nBack of \n\nupper arm\n\nStomach\n\nThigh\n\nFront Back\n\nAreas on body for injection\n\n4d\n\n4e\n\nPull\n\n4f\n\n\n\n131\n\nBe sure to use the injection technique recommended by your doctor or diabetes nurse.\nRemember: You must take your injection of Bydureon immediately after mixing it.\n\nInsert the needle into your skin (subcutaneously). To inject your full dose, push down on the \nplunger with your thumb until it stops.\n\nWithdraw the needle.\n\nRefer to the package leaflet (section 3) on what to do if you are not sure if you have received a \ncomplete dose.\n\n4h. Dispose of the syringe with the needle still attached as instructed by your doctor or diabetes \nnurse. DO NOT try to recap or reuse the needle.\nYou do not have to save any parts. Each single-dose kit has everything you need for your weekly dose \nof Bydureon.\n\nMedicines should not be disposed of via waste water or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.\n\nWhen it is time for your next weekly dose, start again at step 1.\n\nCommon questions and answers\n\nIf your question is about:                           See question number:\nHow soon to inject after mixing 1\nMixing the medicine 2\nAir bubbles in syringe 3\nAttaching the needle 4\nRemoving the needle cover 5\nPlunger not lining up with black dashed Dose Line 6\nBeing unable to push the plunger down when injecting 7\n\nCommon questions and answers\n\n1. After I mix the medicine, how long can I wait before taking the injection?\n\nYou must take your injection of Bydureon immediately after mixing it. If you do not inject Bydureon \nimmediately, the medicine will start to form small clumps in the syringe. These clumps could clog the \nneedle when you take the injection (see question 7).\n\n2. How do I know that the medicine is mixed well?\n\nWhen the medicine is mixed well, it should look cloudy. There should not be any dry powder on the \nsides or bottom of the vial. If you do see any dry powder, shake vigorously while continuing to push \ndown on the plunger with your thumb. (This question relates to the steps shown in sections 3a to 3d).\n\n4g\n\n\n\n132\n\n3. I\u2019m ready to take the injection. What should I do if I see air bubbles in the syringe?\n\nIt is normal for air bubbles to be in the syringe. The air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose. \nBydureon is injected into your skin (subcutaneously). Air bubbles are not a problem with this type of \ninjection.\n\n4. What should I do if I have trouble attaching the needle?\n\nFirst, be sure you have removed the blue cap. Then, twist the needle onto the syringe until snug. To \nprevent losing medicine, do not push in the plunger while attaching the needle. For more information \non injection techniques talk with your health care professional.\n(This question relates to step 4a.)\n\n5. What should I do if I have trouble removing the needle cover?\n\nWith one hand, hold the syringe near the black dashed Dose Line. With your other hand, hold the \nneedle cover. Pull the needle cover straight off. Do not twist it. (This question relates to step 4f.)\n\n6. I am at step 4c. What should I do if the top of the plunger has been pushed past the black \ndashed Dose Line?\n\nThe black dashed Dose Line shows the correct dose. If the top of the plunger has been pushed past the \nline, you should continue from step 4d and take the injection. Before your next injection in 1 week, \ncarefully review the instructions for steps 3a to 4h. \n\n7. When I inject, what should I do if I cannot push the plunger all the way down?\n\nThis means the needle has become clogged. Remove the needle and replace it with the spare needle \nfrom your kit. Then choose a different injection site and finish taking the injection.\n\nTo review how to:\n\uf0b7 Remove the blue cap of the needle, see step 1d \n\uf0b7 Attach the needle, see step 4a \n\uf0b7 Remove the needle cover and give the injection, see steps 4e to 4g\n\nIf you still cannot push the plunger all the way down, withdraw the needle. Refer to the package leaflet \n(section 3) on what to do if you are not sure if you have received a complete dose.\n\nTo prevent a clogged needle, always mix the medicine very well, and inject immediately after mixing.\n\nBydureon only needs to be taken once a week.\n\nMake a note that you have taken your Bydureon today and mark your calendar for when you are due \nfor your next injection.\n\nWhere to learn more about Bydureon\n\n\uf0b7 Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse\n\uf0b7 Read the Package Leaflet carefully\n\n\n\n133\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USER \nRead these instructions carefully before use\n\nBydureon 2 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled \npen\n\nHow to use Bydureon pre-filled pen \n\nCover\n\nKnob\n\nOrange Label\n\nStriped Label\n\nNeedle Top of pen\n\nMixing window\n\nInspection window\nGreen label\n\nPrior to use of the pen, it is recommended that you should be trained by a doctor or diabetes nurse on \n\nits proper use.\n\nUnless a trained person can help to inject this medicine it is not recommended for people who are \n\nblind or cannot see well.\n\nStep 1: Prepare your pen\n\nA. Let your pen warm up. \n\nRemove one pen from the refrigerator and \n\nlet it stand at room temperature for at least \n\n15 minutes.

Combine the medicine.\n\nWhile holding the pen upright with the \n\nneedle cover uppermost, slowly turn the \n\nknob anticlockwise. STOP when you hear \n\nthe click and the green label disappears.\n\nB. Firmly tap the pen to mix.\n\n\uf0b7 Hold the pen by the end with the orange \n\nlabel and tap the pen firmly against the \n\npalm of your hand.\n\n\uf0b7 WITHOUT twisting the knob, ROTATE\n\nthe pen every few taps. \n\n\uf0b7 Tap the prefilled pen firmly until a \n\nuniformly cloudy suspension with no \n\nclumps is obtained. \n\n\uf0b7 You may need to tap 80 times or more.\n\nC. Check the suspension. \n\nHold the pen up to the light and look through both sides of the mixing window. The \n\nsolution should have NO CLUMPS and be uniformly cloudy.\n\n80 times or more\n\nHold Upright\n\nCLICK!\n\n\n\n135\n\nTo get your full dose the medicine must be mixed well.\n\nIf it\u2019s not mixed well, tap longer and more firmly.\n\nDO NOT proceed unless your medicine is mixed well\n\nTo get your full dose the medicine must be mixed well. If it\u2019s not mixed well, tap longer and more \n\nfirmly. It\u2019s normal if you see air bubbles in the liquid, and they will cause no harm.\n\nD. Compare both sides of the mixing window to the photos below, \n\nby holding the pen against the page. Pay attention to the bottom surface. If you don\u2019t see \n\nclumps you are ready to inject.\n\nStep 3: Inject your dose\n\nIMPORTANT Once the medicine is mixed well, you must inject the dose immediately. You \n\ncannot save it for later use.\n\nA. Choose your injection site,\n\nin either your stomach, thigh, or back of the \n\narm. Each week you can use the same area \n\nof your body but choose a different \n\ninjection site in that area. Gently clean the \n\narea with soap and water or an alcohol \n\nswab. \n\n\n\n136\n\nB. Twist knob to release injection button.\n\nWhile holding the pen upright with the \n\nneedle cover uppermost, twist the knob \n\nanticlockwise until the orange label \n\ndisappears and the injection button is \n\nreleased. DO NOT push the injection \n\nbutton yet.\n\nC. Remove the needle cover,\n\nby pulling straight off. DO NOT twist. You \n\nmay see a few drops of liquid on the needle \n\nor in the cover.\n\nD. Inject the medicine. \n\nInsert the needle into your skin \n\n(subcutaneously). Press the injection button \n\nwith your thumb until you hear a click. \n\nHold for 10 seconds to make sure you get \n\nthe full dose.\n\nE. Properly dispose of your pen, \n\nwith the needle attached, in a \n\npuncture-resistant container. DO NOT try \n\nto recap or reuse the needle.\n\nCommon Questions and Answers\n\n1. How do I know that the medicine is mixed well?\n\nThe medicine is mixed well when the liquid looks cloudy from both sides of the window. You \n\nshould not see any clumps in the liquid. It may help to hold the pen up to the light to see in the \n\nwindow. If you see clumps of any size keep tapping the pen firmly against the palm of your \n\nhand until mixed.\n\n2. I am having trouble mixing my dose. What should I do?\n\nRemember, before preparing your dose, leave the pen out of the refrigerator for at least 15 \n\nminutes. This will let the pen warm up to room temperature. It will be easier to mix the \n\nmedicine if the pen is at room temperature.\n\nBe sure you are holding the pen at the end with the knob and the orange label. This will help \n\nyou grip the pen better and tap it more firmly against your palm.\n\nIt may also help to tap the mixing window on both sides against your palm. If you see any \n\nclumps, keep tapping.\n\nHold \nUpright\n\nInjection \nButton\n\n\n\n137\n\n3. After I mix the medicine, how long can I wait before taking the injection?\n\nYou must inject your dose right after mixing it. If you do not inject your dose right away, \n\nsmall clumps of medicine may form in the pen and you may not get your full dose.\n\n4. I\u2019m ready to inject my dose. What should I do if I see air bubbles in the pen?\n\nIt is normal for air bubbles to be in the pen. The medicine is injected into your skin \n\n(subcutaneously). Air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose with this type of \n\ninjection.\n\n5. What should I do if I cannot push the injection button all the way in when trying to \n\ninject my dose?\n\nCheck that you have fully screwed on the pen needle. Also be sure you twisted the knob until \n\nit stopped, the orange label disappeared, and the injection button appears.\n\nIf you still cannot push the button in, this may mean that the needle is clogged. Remove the \n\nneedle from your skin and replace it with the spare needle from the carton. Review how to \n\nattach the needle. Then choose a different injection site and finish taking the injection.\n\nIf you still cannot push the button all the way in, remove the needle from your skin. Use a \n\npuncture-resistant container to throw away the pen with the needle still attached.\n\n6. How do I know if I injected my full dose?\n\nTo be sure you get your full dose, press the injection button with your thumb until you hear a \n\nclick. After the click, continue to hold the needle in your skin for 10 seconds. This will allow \n\nenough time for all the medicine to go from the pen to under your skin.\n\n7. How do I dispose of my Bydureon pen?\n\nYou will need a puncture-resistant container that is large enough to hold the entire pen with a \n\nused needle attached. Be sure the container has a lid. You may use a biohazard container, \n\nanother hard plastic container, or a metal container. A container is not included in the carton.\n\nAsk your pharmacist how to safely throw away the container with used pens and needles. Do \n\nnot throw the container in your household waste.\n\n\n\n138\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USER \nRead these instructions carefully before use\nRead also the Package Leaflet in your carton\n\nBydureon 2 mg prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen\nexenatide\n\nOnce weekly\nFor subcutaneous use only\nSingle-dose pre-filled pen \nBCise is the name of the pre-filled pen device used to inject your Bydureon medicine.\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nThe Bydureon BCise pen:\n\u2212 Is a single use, fixed dose pen that automatically injects your medicine.\n\u2212 Comes in the locked position before you use it.

How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed?\n\nAfter shaking the pen, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine \nalong the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the pen hard \nuntil the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even \nthroughout (see pictures in Figure G and Figure H, Step 2C).\n\n3. Why do I need to hold the pen upright while removing the orange cap?\n\nHolding the pen with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal \nto see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.\n\n4. Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it?\n\nIf you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will \nnot get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your pen is in the locked position. However, \nafter you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. \nYou cannot save it for later use.\n\n5.

If the \norange rod does not appear, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder \n(see section 6 of the Package Leaflet for a list of contacts by country).\n\n6. Why should I store my pen flat in the refrigerator?\n\nPens stored vertically (with the needle up or down) are more difficult to mix. The medicine can still be \nfully mixed but it will take more shaking and more time.\n\n7. How do I dispose of my Bydureon BCise pen?\n\nDo not throw away the pen in your household waste. You will need a puncture-resistant container that \nis large enough to hold the entire pen. Be sure the container has a lid.

nurse has told you. check with your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure. you should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals. you should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. do not inject into a vein or muscle. each week you can use the same area of your body. be sure to choose a different injection site in that area. never mix insulin and bydureon together in the same injection. if you need to give yourself both at the same time, use two separate injections. you may give both injections in the same body area (for example, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other. test your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a sulphonylurea. follow the \"instructions for the user\" provided in the carton to inject bydureon your doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the first time. check that the liquid in the syringe is clear and free of particles before you begin. after mixing, use the suspension only if the mixture is white to off white and cloudy. if you see clumps of dry powder on the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is not mixed well. shake vigorously again until well mixed. you should inject this medicine immediately after mixing the powder and the solvent. use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it safely after each use as instructed by your doctor or diabetes nurse. if you use more bydureon than you should if you use more of this medicine than you should, please consult with your doctor first as you may need medical treatment. using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or symptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4). if you forget to use bydureon you might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your bydureon injection. if you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose as soon as it is possible to do so. for your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day. if you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and take the next one as usual, on the day it is due. you can also change your chosen injection day, as long as your last dose was given 3 or more days before. do not take two doses of bydureon within 3 days of each other. if you are not sure you have taken the full dose of bydureon if you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just take it next week as planned. if you stop using bydureon if you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. if you stop using this medicine this can affect your blood sugar levels. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "bydureon", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine",
