This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMektovi 15 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 15 mg of binimetinib. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 133.5 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nYellow to dark yellow, unscored biconvex, ovaloid film-coated tablets approximately 12 mm in length \nand 5 mm in width, with the \u201cA\u201d logo debossed on one side of the tablet and \u201c15\u201d on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBinimetinib in combination with encorafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nBinimetinib treatment in combination with encorafenib should be initiated and supervised under the \nresponsibility of a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of binimetinib is 45 mg (three 15 mg tablets) twice daily, corresponding to a \ntotal daily dose of 90 mg approximately 12 hours apart. \n \nDose modification \nThe management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment \ndiscontinuation (see below, Table 1 and Table 2).  \n \nFor patients receiving 45 mg binimetinib twice daily, the recommended reduced dose of binimetinib is \n30 mg twice daily. Dose reduction below 30 mg twice daily is not recommended. Therapy should be \ndiscontinued if the patient is not able to tolerate 30 mg orally twice daily. \n \nIf the adverse reaction that resulted in a dose reduction is under effective management, dose \nre-escalation to 45 mg twice daily may be considered. Dose re-escalation to 45 mg twice daily is not \nrecommended if the dose reduction is due to left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) or any Grade 4 toxicity. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose modifications recommendations in case of adverse reactions are presented below and in \nTables 1 and 2.  \n \nIf treatment-related toxicities occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib, then \nboth treatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where \ndose reductions are necessary for encorafenib only (adverse reactions primarily related to encorafenib) \nare: palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), uveitis including iritis and iridocyclitis and \nQTc prolongation. \n \nIf one of these toxicities occurs, see section 4.2. of encorafenib Summary of Product Characteristics \n(SmPC) for dose modification instructions for encorafenib. \n \nIf binimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be reduced to 300 mg once daily during \nthe time of binimetinib dose interruption (see Tables 1 and 2) as encorafenib is not well-tolerated at \nthe dose of 450 mg as a single agent. If binimetinib is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should \nbe discontinued.  \n \nIf encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC), binimetinib should be \ninterrupted. If encorafenib is permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  \nFor information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of encorafenib, see section 4.2 \nof encorafenib SmPC. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications for binimetinib (used in combination with \n\nencorafenib) for selected adverse reaction \n\nSeverity of adverse reactiona Binimetinib \n\nCutaneous reactions \n\n\u2022 Grade2 Binimetinib should be maintained.  \nIf rash worsens or does not improve within 2 weeks with \ntreatment, binimetinib should be withheld until improved to \nGrade 0 or 1 and then resumed at the same dose if first \noccurrence or resumed at a reduced dose if recurrent Grade2. \n\n\u2022 Grade 3 \n \n\nBinimetinib should be withheld until improved to Grade 0 or 1 \nand resumed at the same dose if first occurrence or resumed at \na reduced dose if recurrent Grade 3. \n\n\u2022 Grade 4 Binimetinib should be permanently discontinued. \n\nOcular events \n\n\u2022 Symptomatic retinal pigment \nepithelial detachments (RPED) \n(Grade 2 or 3) \n\nBinimetinib should be withheld for up to 2 weeks and \nophthalmic monitoring should be repeated including visual \nacuity assessment. \n\u2022 If improved to Grade 0 or 1, binimetinib should be \n\nresumed at same dose. \n\u2022 If improved to Grade 2, binimetinib should be resumed at \n\na lower dose. \n\u2022 If not improved to Grade 2, binimetinib should be \n\npermanently discontinued. \n\n\u2022 Symptomatic RPED (Grade 4) \nassociated with reduced visual \nacuity (Grade 4) \n\nBinimetinib should be permanently discontinued. \n\n\u2022 Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) Binimetinib should be permanently discontinued. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSeverity of adverse reactiona Binimetinib \n\nCardiac events \n\n\u2022 Grade 2 Left ventricular \nejection fraction (LVEF) \ndecrease or asymptomatic, \nabsolute decrease in LVEF of \ngreater than 10 % from baseline \nthat is below lower limit of \nnormal (LLN) \n\nLVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks.  \n\u2022 If asymptomatic: \n\nBinimetinib should be withheld for up to 4 weeks. \nBinimetinib should be resumed at a reduced dose if all of \nthe following are present within 4 weeks: \no LVEF is at or above the LLN  \no Absolute decrease from baseline is 10 % or less. \n\n\u2022 If the LVEF does not recover within 4 weeks, binimetinib \nshould be permanently discontinued. \n\n\u2022 Grade 3 or 4 LVEF decrease or \nsymptomatic left ventricular \ndysfunction (LVD) \n\nBinimetinib should be permanently discontinued. \nLVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks until recovery. \n\nRhabdomyolysis/Creatine phosphokinase (CK) elevation \n\n\u2022 Grade 3 (CK > 5 \u2013 10x upper \nlimit of normal (ULN)) \nasymptomatic \n\nBinimetinib dose should be maintained and it should be \nensured that patient is adequately hydrated. \n\n\u2022 Grade 4 (CK > 10x ULN) \nasymptomatic \n\nBinimetinib should be withheld until improved to \nGrade 0 or 1.

(see \nsection 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC).  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of binimetinib in children and adolescents have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nMektovi is for oral use. \nThe tablets are to be swallowed whole with water. They may be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBinimetinib is to be given in combination with encorafenib. For additional information on warnings \nand precautions associated with encorafenib treatment, see section 4.4 of encorafenib SmPC. \n \nBRAF mutation testing \n \nBefore taking binimetinib in combination with encorafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation \nconfirmed by validated test. The efficacy and safety of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib \nhave been established only in patients with tumours expressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations. \nBinimetinib in combination with encorafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF \nmalignant melanoma. \n \nBinimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor \n \nThere are limited data for use of the combination of binimetinib with encorafenib in patients who have \nprogressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma \nwith BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be lower in \nthese patients. \n \nBinimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients with brain metastases \n \nThere are limited efficacy data with the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib in patients with a \nBRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction (LVD) \n \nLVD defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction can occur when \nbinimetinib is administered.  \nIt is recommended that LVEF is assessed by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan \nbefore initiation of binimetinib, 1 month after initiation, and then at approximately 3-month intervals \nor more frequently as clinically indicated, while on treatment. The occurrence of LVEF decrease can \nbe managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nThe safety of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib has not been established in patients with a \nbaseline LVEF that is either below 50 % or below the institutional LLN. Therefore, in these patients, \nbinimetinib should be used with caution and for any symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, \nGrade 3-4 LVEF, or absolute decrease of LVEF from baseline of \u2265 10 %, binimetinib should be \ndiscontinued and LVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks until recovery. \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nHaemorrhages, including major haemorrhagic events, can occur when binimetinib is administered (see \nsection 4.8). The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of anticoagulant and \nantiplatelet therapy. The occurrence of Grade \u2265 3 haemorrhagic events should be managed with dose \n\n. \n\n\n\n8 \n\ninterruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see Table 2 in section 4.2) and as clinically \nindicated. \n \nOcular toxicities \n \nOcular toxicities including RPED and RVO can occur when binimetinib is administered. Uveitis \nincluding iridocyclitis and iritis have been reported in patients treated with binimetinib in combination \nwith encorafenib (see section 4.8). \n \nBinimetinib is not recommended in patients with a history of RVO. The safety of binimetinib has not \nbeen established in patients with predisposing factors for RVO including uncontrolled glaucoma, \nocular hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or a history of hyperviscosity or \nhypercoagulability syndromes. Therefore, binimetinib should be used with caution in these patients.  \n \nPatients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances. If \nsymptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances including diminished central vision, blurred vision \nor loss of vision are identified, a prompt ophthalmologic examination is recommended.  \nThe occurrence of symptomatic RPED can be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or \nwith treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \nBinimetinib should be permanently discontinued with the occurrence of RVO (see Table 1 in \nsection 4.2). \n \nIf during treatment patient develops uveitis, see section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC for guidance.  \n \nCK elevation and rhabdomyolysis \n \nAsymptomatic CK elevations are seen in patients treated with binimetinib (see section 4.8), and, \nrhabdomyolysis was uncommonly reported. Special attention should be paid to patients with \nneuromuscular conditions associated with CK elevation and rhabdomyolysis. \n \nCK and creatinine levels should be monitored monthly during the first 6 months of treatment and as \nclinically indicated. The patient should be advised to maintain an adequate fluid intake during \ntreatment. Depending on the severity of symptoms, degree of CK elevation or creatinine elevation, \ndose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of binimetinib may be required (see \nTable 1 in section 4.2). \n \nHypertension \n \nHypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, can occur with the use of binimetinib. Blood \npressure should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment, with control of hypertension \nby standard therapy as appropriate. In case of severe hypertension, temporary interruption of \nbinimetinib is recommended until hypertension is controlled (see Table 2 in section 4.2). \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \n \nVTE can occur when binimetinib is administered (see section 4.8). Binimetinib should be used with \ncaution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of VTE.  \nIf during treatment patient develops VTE or pulmonary embolism, it should be managed with dose \ninterruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \n \nPneumonitis/Interstitial lung disease \n \nPneumonitis/ILD can occur with binimetinib. Treatment with binimetinib should be withheld in \npatients with suspected pneumonitis or ILD, including patients presenting new or progressive \npulmonary symptoms or findings such as cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, reticular opacities or pulmonary \n\n\n\n9 \n\ninfiltrates (see Table 1 in section 4.2). Binimetinib should be permanently discontinued in patients \ndiagnosed with treatment related pneumonitis or ILD.  \n \nNew primary malignancies \n \nNew primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with \nBRAF inhibitors and can occur when binimetinib is administered in combination with encorafenib \n(see section 4.8). \n \nCutaneous malignancies \nCutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including \nkerathoacanthoma has been observed in patients treated with binimetinib when used in combination \nwith encorafenib. \nDermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with binimetinib in \ncombination with encorafenib, every 2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following \ndiscontinuation of the combination. Suspicious skin lesions should be managed with dermatological \nexcision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their \nphysicians if new skin lesions develop. Binimetinib and encorafenib should be continued without any \ndose modifications.  \n \nNon-cutaneous malignancies \nBased on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation \nof RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving binimetinib in combination with \nencorafenib should undergo a head and neck examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography \n(CT) scan, anal and pelvic examinations (for women) and complete blood cell counts prior to \ninitiation, during and at the end of treatment as clinically appropriate. \nPermanent discontinuation of binimetinib and encorafenib should be considered in patients who \ndevelops RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should be carefully \nconsidered before administering binimetinib in combination with encorafenib to patients with a prior \nor concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation. \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT elevations can occur with binimetinib (see \nsection 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of binimetinib and \nencorafenib and at least monthly during the 6 first months of treatment, and then as clinically \nindicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nLiver metabolism mainly via glucuronidation is the primary route of elimination of binimetinib (see \nsection 5.2). As encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these \npatients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nLactose intolerance \n \nMektovi contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on binimetinib \n \nBinimetinib is primarily metabolised through UGT1A1 mediated glucuronidation. The extent of drug \ninteractions mediated by UGT1A1 is unlikely to be clinically relevant (see section 5.2); however, as \n\n\n\n10 \n\nthis has not been evaluated in a formal clinical study, UGT1A1 inducers (such as rifampicin and \nphenobarbital) and inhibitors (such as indinavir, atazanavir, sorafenib) should be co-administered with \ncaution. \n \nWhile encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, no differences in binimetinib \nexposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib is co-administered with encorafenib (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nInducers of CYP1A2 enzymes (such as carbamazepine and rifampicin) and inducers of Pgp transport \n(such as Saint John's wort or phenytoin) may decrease binimetinib exposure, which could result in a \ndecrease of efficacy. \n \nEffects of binimetinib on other medicinal products \n \nBinimetinib is a potential inducer of CYP1A2, and caution should be taken when it is used with \nsensitive substrates (such as duloxetine or theophylline). \n \nBinimetinib is a weak inhibitor of OAT3, and caution should be taken when it is used with sensitive \nsubstrates (such as pravastatin or ciprofloxacin). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with binimetinib \nand for at least 1 month following the last dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of binimetinb in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Binimetinib is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception. If binimetinib is used during pregnancy, or if \nthe patient becomes pregnant while taking binimetinib, the patient should be informed of the potential \nhazard to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether binimetinib or its metabolite are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue Mektovi therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and \nthe benefit of therapy for the mother.   \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effect on fertility in humans for binimetinib. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBinimetinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have been \nreported in patients treated with binimetinib during clinical studies. Patients should be advised not to \ndrive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse reaction that may \naffect their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe safety of binimetinib (45 mg orally twice daily) in combination with encorafenib (450 mg orally \nonce daily) (hereafter referred to as Combo 450) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 \nmutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, based on two Phase II studies (CMEK162X2110 and \nCLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1) (hereafter referred to as the \npooled Combo 450 population). At the recommended dose (n = 274) in patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic melanoma, the most common adverse reactions (> 25 %) occurring in patients treated with \nbinimetinib administered with encorafenib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, retinal \ndetachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, blood CK increased and myalgia. \n \nThe safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally \ntwice daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic \nmelanoma (hereafter referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study \n(CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated \nwith encorafenib 300 mg administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and the following frequency \nconvention: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n  \n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions occurring in patients receiving binimetinib in combination with \nencorafenib at the recommended dose (n = 274) \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction  Frequency (All grades) \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and unspecified \n\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinomaa Common \nBasal cell carcinoma* Common \nSkin papilloma*  Common \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nAnaemia Very common \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivityb Common \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nNeuropathy peripheral*  Very common \nDizziness* Very common \nHeadache*  Very common \nDysgeusia  Common \nFacial paresisc Uncommon \n\nEye disorders \nVisual impairment* Very common \nRPED* Very common \nUveitis* Common \n\nCardiac disorders Left ventricular dysfunctiond Common \n\nVascular disorders \nHaemorrhagee  Very common \nHypertension* Very common \nVenous thromboembolismf  Common \n\n\n\n12 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nAbdominal pain* Very common \nDiarrhoea* Very common \nVomiting*  Very common \nNausea Very common \nConstipation Very common \nColitisg  Common \nPancreatitis*   Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nHyperkeratosis * Very common \nRash * Very common \nDry skin*  Very common \nPruritus*  Very common \nAlopecia*  Very common \nPhotosensitivity* Common \nDermatitis acneiform* Common \nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia \nsyndrome (PPES) \n\nCommon \n\nErythema* Common \nPanniculitis* Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia*  Very common \nMuscular disorders/Myalgiah Very common \nBack pain  Very common \nPain in extremity Very common \nRhabdomyolysis Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nRenal failure* Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia*   Very common \nPeripheral oedema i Very common \nFatigue*  Very common \n\nInvestigations \n\nBlood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased \n\nVery Common \n\nTransaminase increased* Very Common \nGamma-glutamyl transferase \nincreased* \n\nVery Common \n\nBlood creatinine increased* Common \nBlood alkaline phosphatase increased Common \nAmylase increased Common \nLipase increased Common \n\n*composite terms which included more than one preferred term \na includes keratoacanthoma, squamous cell carcinoma, lip squamous cell carcinoma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma of skin  \nb includes angioedema, drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity vasculitis and urticaria \nc includes facial nerve disorder, facial paralysis, facial paresis \nd includes left ventricular dysfunction, ejection fraction decreased, cardiac failure and ejection fraction \nabnormal \ne includes haemorrhage at various sites including cerebral haemorrhage \nf includes pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, embolism, thrombophlebitis, thrombophlebitis \nsuperficial and thrombosis \ng includes colitis, colitis ulcerative, enterocolitis and proctitis \nh includes myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle spasm, muscle injury, myopathy, myositis \ni includes fluid retention, peripheral oedema, localised oedema \n \nWhen encorafenib was used at a dose of 300 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg \ntwice daily (Combo 300) in study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, the frequency category was lower \ncompared to the pooled Combo 450 population for the following adverse reactions: anemia, peripheral \n\n\n\n13 \n\nneuropathy, haemorrhage, hypertension, pruritus (common) and colitis, increased amylase and \nincreased lipase (uncommon). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCutaneous malignancies \nCuSCC was reported when binimetinib was used in combination with encorafenib (see section 4.8 of \nencorafenib SmPC). \n \nOcular events \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, RPED was reported in 29.6 % (81/274) of patients. RPED was \nGrade 1 (asymptomatic) in 21.2 % (58/274) of patients, Grade 2 in 6.6 % (18/274) of patients and \nGrade 3 in 1.8 % (5/274) of patients. Most events were reported as retinopathy, retinal detachment, \nsubretinal fluid, macular oedema, and chorioretinopathy and led to dose interruptions or dose \nmodifications in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients. The median time to onset of the first event of RPED (all \ngrades) was 1.5 month (range 0.03 to 17.5 months).  \nVisual impairment, including vision blurred and reduced visual acuity, occurred in 21.5 % (59/274) of \npatients. Visual impairment was generally reversible. \nUveitis was also reported when binimetinib was used in combination with encorafenib (see section 4.8 \nof encorafenib SmPC). \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, RPED was observed in 12.5% (32/257) of \npatients with 0.4% (1/257) Grade 4 event.  \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, LVD was reported in 8.4 % (23/274) of patients. Grade 3 events \noccurred in 1.1 % (3/274) of patients. LVD led to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% (1/274) of \npatients and led to dose interruptions or dose reductions in 6.6 % (18/274) of patients.  \nThe median time to first occurrence of LVD (any grade) was 4.4 months (range 0.03 to 21.3 months) \nin patients who developed an LVEF below 50 %. The mean LVEF value dropped by 5.9 % in the \npooled Combo 450 population, from a mean of 63.9 % at baseline to 58.1 %. LVD was generally \nreversible following dose reduction or dose interruption. \n \nHaemorrhage \nHaemorrhagic events were observed in 17.9 % (49/274) of patients in the pooled Combo 450 \npopulation. Most of these cases were Grade 1 or 2 (14.6 %) and 3.3 % were Grade 3 or 4 events. Few \npatients requiring dose interruptions or dose reductions (0.7 % or 2/274). Haemorrhagic events led to \ndiscontinuation of treatment in 1.1 % (3/274) of patients. The most frequent haemorrhagic events were \nhaematuria in 3.3 % (9/274) of patients, rectal haemorrhage in 2.9 % (8/274) and haematochezia in \n2.9 % (8/274) of patients. Fatal gastric ulcer haemorrhage with multiple organ failure as a concurrent \ncause of death, occurred in one patient. Cerebral haemorrhage occurred in 1.5 % (4/274) of patients \nwith fatal outcome in 3 patients. All events occurred in the setting of new or progressive brain \nmetastases.  \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, haemorrhagic events were observed in 6.6% \n(17/257) of patients and were Grade 3-4 in 1.6% (4/257) of patients.  \n \nHypertension  \nNew onset elevated blood pressure or worsening of pre-existing hypertension were reported in 11.7 % \n(32/274) of patients treated with the Combo 450. Hypertension events were reported as Grade 3 in \n5.5 % (15/274) of patients, including hypertensive crisis (0.4 % (1/274)). Hypertension led to dose \ninterruption or adjustment in 2.9 % of patients. Hypertensive adverse reactions required additional \ntherapy in 8.0 % (22/274) of patients.  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nVenous thromboembolism \nIn patients treated with Combo 450, VTE occurred in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients, including 2.2 % \n(6/274) of patients who developed pulmonary embolism. In the pooled Combo 450 population, VTE \nwas reported as Grade 1 or 2 in 3.6 % (10/274) of patients and Grade 3 or 4 in 1.1 % (3/274) of \npatients. VTE led to dose interruptions or dose modifications in 1.1 % (3/274) patients and to \nadditional therapy in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients. \n \nPancreatitis \nPancreatitis was reported when binimetinib was used in combination with encorafenib (see section 4.8 \nof encorafenib SmPC). \n \nDermatologic reactions \nDermatologic reactions may occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib. \n \nRash \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, rash occurred in 19.7 % (54/274) of patients. Most events were \nmild, with Grade 3 or 4 events reported in 0.7 % (2/274) of patients. Rash led to treatment \ndiscontinuation in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients and to dose interruption or dose modification in 1.1 % \n(3/274) of patients. \n \nDermatitis acneiform \nIn patients treated with Combo 450, dermatitis acneiform occurred in 4.4 % (12/274) of patients, was \nGrade 1 and 2 and no event led to treatment discontinuation. Dose modification was reported in 0.7 % \n(2/274) of patients.  \n \nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome \nPPES can occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib (see section 4.8 of \nencorafenib SmPC). \n \nPhotosensitivity \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, photosensitivity was observed in 4.0 % (11/274) of patients. \nMost events were Grade 1-2, with Grade 3 reported in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients and no event led to \ndiscontinuation.

The \nmedian time to onset of the first event was 2.7 months (range: 0.5 to 17.5 months). \n \nRhabdomyolysis was reported in 0.4 % (1/274) of patients treated with encorafenib in combination \nwith binimetinib. In this patient, rhabdomyolysis was observed with concomitant symptomatic \nGrade 4 CK elevation. \n \nRenal dysfunction \nBlood creatinine elevation and renal failure occurred when binimetinib was used in combination with \nencorafenib (see section 4.8 of encorafenib SmPC). \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \nThe incidences of liver laboratory abnormalities reported in the pooled Combo 450 population are \nlisted below:  \n\n\u2022 Increased transaminases: 15.7% (43/274) overall \u2013 Grade 3-4: 5.5% (15/274) \n\u2022 Increased GGT: 14.6% (40/274) overall \u2013 Grade 3-4: 8.4% (23/274) \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, the incidences of liver laboratory \nabnormalities are listed below:  \n\n\u2022 Increased transaminases: 13.2% (34/257) overall \u2013 Grade 3-4: 5.4% (14/257) \n\u2022 Increased GGT: 14.0% (36/257) overall \u2013 Grade 3-4: 4.7% (12/257) \n\n \nGastrointestinal disorders   \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, diarrhoea was observed in 38 % (104/274) of patients and was \nGrade 3 or 4 in 3.3 % (9/274) of patients. Diarrhoea led to dose discontinuation in 0.4 % of patients \nand to dose interruption or dose modification in 4.4 % of patients. Constipation occurred in 24.1 % \n(66/274) of patients and was Grade 1 or 2. Abdominal pain was reported in 27.4 % (75/274) of \npatients and was Grade 3 in 2.6 % (7/274) patients. Nausea occurred in 41.6 % (114/274) with \nGrade 3 or 4 observed in 2.6 % (7/274) of patients. Vomiting occurred in 28.1 % (77/274) of patients \nwith Grade 3 or 4 reported in 2.2 % (6/274) of patients. \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, nausea was observed in 27.2% (70/257) of \npatients and was Grade 3 in 1.6% (4/257) of patients. Vomiting occurred in 15.2% (39/257) of patients \nwith Grade 3 reported in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. Diarrhoea occurred in 28.4% (73/257) of patients \nwith Grade 3 reported in 1.6% (4/257) of patients.  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders were typically managed with standard therapy. \n \nAnaemia \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, anaemia was reported in 19.7 % (54/274) of patients; 4.7 % \n(13/274) of patients had Grade 3 or 4. No patients discontinued treatment due to anaemia, 1.5 % \n(4/274) required dose interruption or dose modification. \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, anaemia was observed in 9.7% (25/257) of \npatients with Grade 3-4 reported in 2.7% (7/257) patients.  \n \nHeadache \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, headache occurred in 21.5% (59/274) of patients including \nGrade 3 in 1.5% (4/274) of patients.  \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, headache was reported in 12.1% (31/257) of \npatients and was Grade 3 in 0.4% (1/257) of patients. \n \nFatigue \nIn the pooled Combo 450 population, fatigue occurred in 43.8% (120/274) of patients including Grade \n3 in 2.9% (8/274) of patients.  \n \nIn Study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, in the Combo 300 arm, fatigue was observed in 33.5% (86/257) of \npatients with 1.6% (4/257) Grade 3-4 events. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nIn patients treated with Combo 450 (n = 274), 194 patients (70.8 %) were < 65 years old, 65 patients \n(23.7 %) were 65 -74 years old and 15 patients (5.5 %) were aged > 75. No overall differences in \nsafety or efficacy were observed between elderly patients (\u2265 65) and younger patients. The proportion \nof patients experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in patients aged <65 \nyears and those aged > 65 years. The most common adverse events reported with a higher incidence in \npatients aged \u2265 65 years compared to patients aged < 65 years included diarrhoea, pruritus, GGT and \nblood phosphatase alkaline elevation. In the small group of patients aged \u2265 75 years (n=15), patients \nwere more likely to experience serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of \ntreatment.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest dose of binimetinib evaluated as single agent in clinical studies was 80 mg administered \norally twice daily and was associated with ocular (chorioretinopathy) and skin toxicities (dermatitis \nacneiform).  \n \nThere is no specific treatment of overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated \nsupportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  \nSince binimetinib is highly bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the \ntreatment of overdose with binimetinib.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE41 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBinimetinib is an ATP-uncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of mitogen-activated \nextracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In cell free system, binimetinib inhibits \nMEK1 and MEK2 with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)\u2019s in the 12-46 nM. MEK \nproteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which \npromotes cellular proliferation. In melanoma and other cancers, this pathway is often activated by \nmutated forms of BRAF which activates MEK. Binimetinib inhibits activation of MEK by BRAF and \ninhibits MEK kinase activity. Binimetinib inhibits growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines \nand demonstrates anti-tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma animal models.  \n \nCombination with encorafenib \n \nBinimetinib and encorafenib (a BRAF inhibitor, see section 5.1 of encorafenib SmPC) both inhibit the \nMAPK pathway resulting in higher anti-tumour activity.   \nAdditionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib prevented the emergence of treatment \nresistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma \nThe safety and efficacy of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib were evaluated in a 2-part \nPhase III, randomised (1:1:1) active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study in patients with \nunresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 E or K mutant melanoma (Study CMEK162B2301), as \ndetected using a BRAF assay. Patients had histologically confirmed cutaneous or unknown primary \nmelanoma but those with uveal or mucosal melanoma were excluded. Patients were permitted to \nreceive prior adjuvant therapy and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced \nor metastatic disease. Prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors was not allowed.  \n \nStudy CMEK162B2301, Part 1 \nIn part 1, patients in the study were randomised to receive binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily plus \nencorafenib 450 mg orally daily (Combo 450, n = 192), encorafenib 300 mg orally daily (hereafter \nreferred to as Enco 300, n = 194), or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily (hereafter referred to as \nVem, n = 191). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation \nwas stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, \nvs IVM1c) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1) and prior \nimmunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes vs no).   \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) of Combo 450 compared \nwith vemurafenib as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). PFS as assessed by \ninvestigators (investigator assessment) was a supportive analysis. An additional secondary endpoint \nincluded PFS of Combo 450 compared with Enco 300. Other secondary efficacy comparisons between \nCombo 450 and either vemurafenib or Enco 300 included overall survival (OS), objective response \nrate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by BIRC and by \ninvestigator assessment. \n \nThe median age of patients was 56 years (range 20-89), 58 % were male, 90 % were Caucasian, and \n72 % of patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients had metastatic disease \n(95 %) and were Stage IVM1c (64 %); 27 % of patients had elevated baseline serum lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH), and 45% of patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline \nand 3.5 % had brain metastases. 27 patients (5 %) had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (anti-\nPD1/PDL1 or ipilimumab) (8 patients in Combo 450 arm (4 %); 7 patients in vemurafenib arm (4 %); \n12 patients in Enco 300 arm (6 %) including 22 patients in the metastatic setting (6 patients in Combo \n450 arm; 5 patients in vemurafenib arm; 11 patients in Enco 300 arm) and 5 patients in the adjuvant \nsetting (2 patients in Combo 450 arm; 2 patients in vemurafenib arm; 1 patient in Enco 300 arm. \n \nThe median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in \npatients treated with encorafenib 300 mg and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. The \nmedian relative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 99.6 % for binimetinib and 100 % for \nencorafenib the median RDI was 86.2 % for Enco 300 and 94.5 % for vemurafenib. \n \nPart 1 of study CMEK162B2301 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npatients treated with Combo 450 compared with patients treated with vemurafenib.

A definitive 10% deterioration in FACT-M and in EORTC \nQLQ-C30 was significantly delayed in patients treated with Combo 450 relative to other treatments. \nThe median time to definitive 10 % deterioration in the FACT-M score was not reached in the \nCombo 450 arm and was 22.1 months (95 % CI: 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm with a HR for the \ndifference of 0.46 (95 % CI: 0.29, 0.72). An analysis of time to definitive 10 % deterioration in \nEORTC QLQ-C30 score provided with similar results. \nPatients receiving Combo 450 reported no change or a slight improvement in the mean change from \nbaseline EQ-5D-5L index score at all visits, whilst patients receiving vemurafenib or encorafenib \nreported decreases at all visits (with statistical significant differences). An evaluation of change over \ntime in score yielded the same trend for EORTC QLQ-C30 and at all visit for FACT-M.     \n \nStudy CMEK162B2301, Part 2 \nPart 2 of study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the \nencorafenib and binimetinib combination. \nThe PFS for encorafenib 300 mg orally daily used in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice \ndaily (Combo 300, n = 258) was compared to the PFS for Enco 300 (n = 280, including 194 patients \nfrom Part 1 and 86 patients from Part 2). Enrolment in Part 2 started after all Part 1 patients were \nrandomised.  \n \nPreliminary Part 2 data at a cut-off date of 9 November 2016 demonstrated the contribution of \nbinimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 months (95 % CI: 10.1, 14.0) for \nCombo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95 % CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent \ncentral review (BIRC). Similar results were observed per Investigator assessment.  \nThe confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9 % (95 % CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300, and 50.4 % (95 % \nCI 44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC was \n12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 and 12.9 months [95 % CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. \nThe median duration of treatment was longer for Combo 300 vs. Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nIn the safety analysis of pooled studies of encorafenib 450 mg once daily in combination with 45 mg \nbinimetinib twice daily (Combo 450), the incidence of new QTc prolongation > 500 ms was 0.7 % \n(2/268) in the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib group, and 2.5 % (5/203) in the encorafenib single \nagent group. QTc prolongation of > 60 ms compared to pre-treatment values was observed in 4.9 % \n(13/268) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and in 3.4 % (7/204) in the encorafenib \nsingle agent group (see section 5.1 of encorafenib SmPC). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nbinimetinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of binimetinib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours \nand advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma. After repeat twice-daily dosing \nconcomitantly with encorafenib, steady-state conditions for binimetinib were reached within 15 days \nwith no major accumulation. The mean (CV %) Cmax,ss was 654 ng/mL (34.7 %) and mean AUCss was \n2.35 ug.h/mL (28.0 %) in combination with encorafenib as estimated by population PK modelling. \nBinimetinib pharmacokinetics have been shown to be approximately dose-linear. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, binimetinib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 hours. Following a \nsingle oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, at least 50 % of the binimetinib dose \nwas absorbed. Administration of a single 45 mg dose of binimetinib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal \ndecreased the maximum binimetinib concentration (Cmax) by 17 %, while the area under the \nconcentration-time curve (AUC) was unchanged. A drug interaction study in healthy subjects \nindicated that the extent of binimetinib exposure is not altered in the presence of a gastric pH-altering \nagent (rabeprazole). \n \nDistribution \n \nBinimetinib is 97.2 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Binimetinib is more distributed in \nplasma than blood. In humans, the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.718. Following a single oral dose of \n45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of binimetinib \nis 374 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, the primary \nbiotransformation pathways of binimetinib observed in humans include glucuronidation, N-\ndealkylation, amide hydrolysis, and loss of ethane-diol from the side chain. The maximum \ncontribution of direct glucuronidation to the clearance of binimetinib was estimated to have been \n61.2 %. Following a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, approximately \n60 % of the circulating radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib. In vitro, CYP1A2 \nand CYP2C19 catalyse the formation of the active metabolite, which represents less than 20 % of the \nbinimetinib exposure clinically. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, a mean of 62.3 % of the \nradioactivity was eliminated in the feces while 31.4 % was eliminated in the urine. In urine, 6.5 % of \nthe radioactivity was excreted as binimetinib. The mean (CV %) apparent clearance (CL/F) of \nbinimetinib was 28.2 L/h (17.5 %). The median (range) binimetinib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 8.66 h \n(8.10 to 13.6 h). \n \nMedicinal product interactions \n \nEffect of UGT1A1 inducers or inhibitors on binimetinib \nBinimetinib is primarily metabolised through UGT1A1 mediated glucuronidation. In clinical study \nsub-analysis, however, there was no apparent relationship observed between binimetinib exposure and \nUGT1A1 mutation status. In addition, simulations to investigate the effect of 400 mg atazanavir \n(UGT1A1 inhibitor) on the exposure of 45 mg binimetinib predicted similar binimetinib Cmax in the \npresence or absence of atazanavir. Therefore, the extent of drug interactions mediated by UGT1A1 is \nminimal, and unlikely clinically relevant; however, as this has not been evaluated in a formal clinical \nstudy, UGT1A1 inducers or inhibitors should be administered with caution.  \n \nEffect of CYP enzymes on binimetinib \nIn vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 catalyse the formation of the active metabolite, AR00426032 (M3) \nby oxidative N-desmethylation.  \n \nEffect of binimetinib on CYP substrates \nBinimetinib is a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nEffect of transporters on binimetinib \nIn vitro experiments indicate that binimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). Inhibition of P-gp or BCRP is unlikely to result in a clinically important \nincrease in binimetinib concentrations as binimetinib exhibits moderate to high passive permeability.  \n \nEffect of binimetinib on transporters \nBinimetinib is a weak inhibitor of OAT3. No clinicallly significant drug-drug interactions caused by \nbinimetinib on other transporters is expected. \n \nBinimetinib is metabolised by UGTs and CYP1A2 and is a substrate for Pgp. Specific inducers of \nthese enzymes have not been studied and may result in a loss of efficacy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge, body weight \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age or body weight do not have a clinically important \neffect on the systemic exposure of binimetinib. \n \nGender \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, the PK of binimetinib were similar in males as \ncompared with females. \n \nRace \nThere are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of binimetinib by race or \nethnicity. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs binimetinib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, patients with moderate to severe \nhepatic impairment may have increased exposure. Results from a dedicated clinical study with \nbinimetinib only indicate similar exposures in patients with mild impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) \nand subjects with normal liver function. A two-fold increase in total binimetinib exposure (AUC) was \nobserved in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.2). This increase expends to three fold in both moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment when considering unbound binimetinib exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nGilbert\u2019s syndrome \nBinimetinib has not been evaluated in patients with Gilbert\u2019s disease. The main route of hepatic \ntransformation of binimetinib being glucoronidation, the decision for treatement should be made by \nthe treating physician taking into account the individual benefit-risk. \n \nRenal impairment \nBinimetinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. Results from a dedicated clinical study showed that \npatients with severe renal impairment (eGFR \u2264 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), had a 29 % increase in exposure \n(AUCinf), a 21 % increase in Cmax, and a 22 % decrease in CL/F compared to matching healthy \nsubjects. These differences were within the variability observed for these parameters in both cohorts of \nthis study (25 % - 49 %) and the variability previously observed in patient clinical studies, hence these \ndifferences are unlikely to be clinically relevant. \n \nThe effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib in combination with \nencorafenib have not been evaluated clinically.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated oral administration of binimetinib in rats for up to 6 months was associated with soft tissue \nmineralisation, gastric mucosal lesions and reversible minimal to mild clinical pathology changes at 7 \nto 12.5 times human therapeutic exposures. In a gastric irritation study in rats, an increased incidence \nof superficial mucosal lesions and of hemorrhagic ulcers were observed. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral \n\n\n\n24 \n\nadministration of binimetinib was associated with gastro-intestinal intolerance, moderate clinical \npathology changes, bone marrow hypercellularity and microscopic findings of gastrointestinal \ninflammation, reversible at the lowest doses which were below human therapeutic exposures. \n \nCarcinogenic potential of binimetinib was not evaluated. Standard genotixicity studies with \nbinimetinib were negative. \n \nThe potential embryo-foetal effects of binimetinib were evaluated in rats and rabbits. In rats, lower \ngestational body weight gain and fetal body weights and a decreased number of ossified fetal \nsternebrae were noted. No effects were noted at 14-times the human therapeutic exposure .  \nIn rabbits, mortality, maternal physical signs of toxicity, lower gestational body weight and abortion \nwere noted. The number of viable foetuses and foetal body weights were reduced and \npost-implantation loss and resorptions were increased. An increased litter incidence of foetal \nventricular septal defects and pulmonary trunk alterations was noted at the highest doses. No effects \nwere observed at 3times the human therapeutic exposure.   \n \nFertility studies were not conducted with binimetinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies, no concern in \nterms of fertility was raised from pathological examination of reproductive organs in rats and \nmonkeys. \n \nBinimetinib has phototoxic potential in vitro.  \nA minimal risk for photosensitisation was shown in vivo at an oral dose providing 3.8-fold higher \nexposure than that achieved with the recommended dose in humans. These data indicate that there is \nminimal risk for phototoxicity with binimetinib at therapeutic doses in patients. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What Mektovi is and what it is used for \n \nMektovi is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance binimetinib. It is used in adults \nin combination with another medicine containing encorafenib to treat a type of skin cancer called \nmelanoma when it has \n\n\u2022 a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and \n\u2022 spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. \n\n \nMutations in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the melanoma to grow. Mektovi targets \nanother protein called \u201cMEK\u201d that stimulates cancer cell growth. When Mektovi is used in \ncombination with encorafenib (which targets the changed \u201cBRAF\u201d protein), the combination slows \ndown or stops the growth of your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Mektovi  \n \nBefore starting treatment your doctor will check for BRAF mutation.  \n \nAs Mektovi is to be used in combination with encorafenib, read the encorafenib leaflet carefully as \nwell as this leaflet.   \n \nDo not take Mektovi  \n-  if you are allergic to binimetinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Mektovi about all of your medical conditions, \nparticularly if you have any of the following:   \n\n\u2022 heart problems \n\u2022 bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding  \n\u2022 eye problems including glaucoma or increased pressure in your eyes \n\u2022 muscle problems \n\u2022 high blood pressure \n\u2022 blood clots \n\u2022 lung or breathing problems \n\u2022 liver problems  \n\n \nTell your doctor if you have ever had blockage in the vein carrying blood away from the eye (retinal \nvein occlusion), as Mektovi is not recommended in such cases. \n \nTell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as binimetinib when taken \nwith encorafenib may worsen certain other types of cancers. \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this \nmedicine: \n \n\n\u2022 Heart problems: Mektovi can make your heart work less well, or make existing heart problems \nworse.
