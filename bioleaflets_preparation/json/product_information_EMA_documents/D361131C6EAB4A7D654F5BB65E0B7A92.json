NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTwinrix Paediatric, suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nHepatitis A (inactivated) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HAB) vaccine (adsorbed). \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nHepatitis A virus (inactivated)1,2 360 ELISA Units \nHepatitis B surface antigen3,4 10 micrograms \n \n1Produced on human diploid (MRC-5) cells \n2Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.025 milligrams Al3+ \n3Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n4Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.2 milligrams Al3+ \n \nThe vaccine may contain traces of neomycin which is used during the manufacturing process (see \nsection 4.3). \n  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTwinrix Paediatric is indicated for use in non immune infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up \nto and including 15 years who are at risk of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n- Dosage \n \nThe dose of 0.5 ml (360 ELISA Units HA/10 µg HBsAg) is recommended for infants, children and \nadolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age. \n \n- Primary vaccination schedule \n \nThe standard primary course of vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric consists of three doses, the first \nadministered at the elected date, the second one month later and the third six months after the first \ndose. The recommended schedule should be adhered to. Once initiated, the primary course of \nvaccination should be completed with the same vaccine. \n \n- Booster dose \n \nIn situations where a booster dose of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B is desired, a monovalent or \n\n\n\n3 \n\ncombined vaccine can be given. The safety and immunogenicity of Twinrix Paediatric administered as \na booster dose following a three-dose primary course have not been evaluated. \n \nLong-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric are available up to \n15 years after vaccination (see section 5.1).  \nThe anti-HBs and anti-HAV antibody titres observed following a primary vaccination course with the \ncombined vaccine are in the range of what is seen following vaccination with the monovalent \nvaccines. General guidelines for booster vaccination can therefore be drawn from experience with the \nmonovalent vaccines, as follows.   \n \nHepatitis B \n \nThe need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full \nprimary vaccination course has not been established; however some official vaccination programmes \ncurrently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be \nrespected. \n \nFor some categories of subjects or patients exposed to HBV (e.g. haemodialysis or \nimmunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure a protective \nantibody level ≥ 10IU/l. \n \nHepatitis A \n \nIt is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis \nA vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be \nensured by immunological memory. Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that \nantibodies are required for protection. \n \nIn situations where a booster dose of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are desired, Twinrix Paediatric \ncan be given. Alternatively, subjects primed with Twinrix Paediatric may be administered a booster \ndose of either of the monovalent vaccines. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTwinrix Paediatric is for intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid region in adolescents and \nchildren or in the anterolateral thigh in infants. \n \nExceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or \nbleeding disorders. However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response \nto the vaccine (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or neomycin. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Twinrix Paediatric should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe \nfebrile illness. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a \npsychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs \nsuch as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It \nis important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIt is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a HA or HB infection at the time of \nvaccination. It is not known whether Twinrix Paediatric will prevent HA and HB in such cases. \n \nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and \nother pathogens known to infect the liver. \n \nTwinrix Paediatric is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e.g. needle stick injury). \n \nThe vaccine has not been tested in patients with impaired immunity.  In haemodialysis patients, \npatients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with an impaired immune system, the \nanticipated immune response may not be achieved after the primary immunisation course. Such \npatients may require additional doses of vaccine; nevertheless immunocompromised patients may fail \nto demonstrate an adequate response. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nSince intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a \nsuboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided. However, exceptionally Twinrix \nPaediatric can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding \ndisorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nTwinrix Paediatric should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo data on concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric with specific hepatitis A \nimmunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated.  However, when the monovalent \nhepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins, \nno influence on seroconversion was observed although it may result in lower antibody titres. \n \nTwinrix Paediatric can be given concomitantly with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. \nAdministration of Twinrix Paediatric at the same time as Cervarix (HPV vaccine) has shown no \nclinically relevant interference in the antibody response to the HPV and hepatitis A antigens. Anti-\nHBs geometric mean antibody concentrations were lower on co-administration, but the clinical \nsignificance of this observation is not known since the seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The \nproportion of subjects reaching anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/ml was 98.3% for concomitant vaccination and \n100% for Twinrix alone. \n \nOnly the concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric with Cervarix has been specifically \nstudied. It is advised that vaccines other than Cervarix should not be administered at the same time as \nTwinrix Paediatric. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe effect of Twinrix Paediatrict on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development \nhas been assessed in rats. This study did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nfertility, pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development. \n \nThe effect of Twinrix Paediatric on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development \n\n\n\n5 \n\nhas not been prospectively evaluated in clinical trials. \n \nData on outcomes of a limited number of pregnancies in vaccinated women do not indicate any \nadverse effects of Twinrix Paediatric on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. While \nit is not expected that recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen would have adverse effects on \npregnancies or the fetus it is recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after delivery \nunless there is an urgent need to protect the mother against hepatitis B infection. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Twinrix Paediatric is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Twinrix \nPaediatric in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Twinrix Paediatric should be made taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Twinrix Paediatric therapy to the \nwoman. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTwinrix Paediatric has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile presented below is based on data from approximately 800 subjects. The most \ncommonly reported adverse reactions following Twinrix Paediatric administration are pain and \nredness occurring in a per dose frequency of 28.5% and 11.5% respectively. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common: ≥ 1/10 \nCommon: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \nVery rare: < 1/10,000 \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nClinical trials \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Upper respiratory tract infection* \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Rare Lymphadenopathy \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Appetite lost \nPsychiatric disorders Common Irritability \nNervous system disorders Common Drowsiness, headache \n\nRare Hypoaesthesia*, paraesthesia*, \ndizziness \n\nVascular disorders Rare Hypotension* \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea \n\nUncommon Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon Rash \n\nRare Urticaria, pruritus* \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Myalgia* \nRare Arthralgia* \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Pain and redness at the injection site \nCommon Swelling at the injection site, injection \n\nsite reaction (such as bruising), fatigue, \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmalaise, fever (≥ 37.5°C) \nRare Influenza like illness*, chills* \n\nPost-marketing surveillance \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with either Twinrix or with GlaxoSmithKline \nmonovalent hepatitis A or B vaccines: \nInfections and infestations Meningitis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura \nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis, allergic reactions including anaphylactoid \n\nreactions and mimicking serum sickness \nNervous system disorders Encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuritis, neuropathy, \n\nparalysis, convulsions \nVascular disorders Vasculitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Angioneurotic oedema, lichen planus, erythema \n\nmultiforme \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nArthritis, muscular weakness \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nImmediate injection site pain \n\nFollowing widespread use of the monovalent hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines, the following  \nundesirable events have additionally been reported in temporal association with vaccination: \nNervous system disorders Multiple sclerosis, myelitis, facial palsy, polyneuritis such \n\nas Guillain-Barré syndrome (with ascending paralysis), \noptic neuritis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nStinging and burning sensation \n\nInvestigations Abnormal liver function tests \n* refers to adverse reactions observed in clinical trials performed with the adult formulation \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdose have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Adverse events reported \nfollowing overdosage were similar to those reported with normal vaccine administration. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code: J07BC20. \n \nTwinrix Paediatric is a combined vaccine formulated by pooling bulk preparations of the purified, \ninactivated hepatitis A (HA) virus and purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), separately \nadsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. \nThe HA virus is propagated in MRC5 human diploid cells. HBsAg is produced by culture, in a \nselective medium, of genetically engineered yeast cells. \nTwinrix Paediatric confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HA \nand anti-HBs antibodies. \n \nProtection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B develops within 2-4 weeks.  In the clinical studies, \nspecific humoral antibodies against hepatitis A were observed in approximately 89% of the subjects \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\none month after the first dose and in 100% one month after the third dose (i.e. month 7).  Specific \nhumoral antibodies against hepatitis B were observed in approximately 67% of the subjects after the \nfirst dose and 100% after the third dose. \n \nIn two long-term clinical trials, persistence of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies has been \ndemonstrated up to 5 years in children aged 1-11 years and up to 15 years in children aged 12-15 \nyears.  \nAt 5 years following initiation of a 0, 1, 6 month schedule of Twinrix Paediatric in children aged 1-11 \nyears all subjects followed up retained ≥15 mIU/ml anti-HAV antibody and 97% had anti-HBs \nantibody ≥10 mIU/ml. \n \nAt 15 years following the initiation of a 0, 1, 6 month schedule of Twinrix Paediatric in children aged \n12-15 years, all subjects followed up retained ≥15 mIU/ml anti-HAV antibody and 81.8% had anti-\nHBs antibody ≥10 mIU/ml. A challenge dose of a HBV vaccine was given to a limited number of \nsubjects (n=11) whose anti-HBs antibody concentrations had decreased to <10 mIU/ml and 10 of the \n11 subjects (90.9%) mounted an anamnestic response. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEvaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on general safety studies. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you/ your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get / your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nThis leaflet has been written assuming the person receiving the vaccine is reading it, but it can be \ngiven to adolescents and children so you may be reading it for your child. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Twinrix Paediatric is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Twinrix Paediatric \n3. How Twinrix Paediatric is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Twinrix Paediatric \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Twinrix Paediatric is and what it is used for \n \nTwinrix Paediatric is a vaccine used in infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and \nincluding 15 years to prevent two diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing \nthe body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. \n \n• Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver. This disease is \n\ncaused by the hepatitis A virus. The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in \nfood and drink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage. Symptoms of hepatitis A \nbegin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus. These consist of nausea (feeling \nsick), fever and aches and pains.  After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become \nyellowish (jaundice). The severity and type of symptoms can vary. Young children may not \ndevelop jaundice. Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to \nkeep people off work for about a month. \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become \n\nswollen (inflamed).  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, \nor saliva (spit) of infected people. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine \nare infectious.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Twinrix Paediatric  \n \nTwinrix Paediatric should not be given if \n• you are allergic to: \n\n- the active substances, or any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- neomycin.   \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n• you have previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B \ndiseases. \n\n• you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  A minor infection such as a \ncold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to you doctor or pharmacist before you receive Twinrix Paediatric if:  \n• you have experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. \n• you have a poor immune system due to illness or drug treatment. \n• you have a bleeding problem or bruise/ bruises easily. \n \nFainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore \ntell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nOther medicines and Twinrix Paediatric  \nTwinrix Paediatric can be given with a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at a separate injection \nsite (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm) during the same visit. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby,  \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. \nIt is not known if Twinrix Paediatric passes into breast milk, however the vaccine is not expected to \ncause problems in breast-fed babies. \n \nTwinrix Paediatric contains neomycin \nPlease tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic). \n \n \n3. How Twinrix Paediatric is given  \n \nYou will receive a total of three injections over 6 months. Each injection is given on a separate visit. \nThe first dose will be given on an elected date. The remaining two doses will be given one month, and \nsix months after the first dose.  \n \n• First dose: at an elected date \n• Second dose: 1 month later \n• Third dose: 6 months after the first dose \n \nYour doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses, and future booster dosing. \n \nIf you miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit. \n \nMake sure you finish the complete vaccination course of three injections. If not, you may not be fully \nprotected against the diseases. \n \nThe doctor will give Twinrix Paediatric as an injection into your upper arm muscle or into the thigh \nmuscle of your child.   \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n4.  Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects that may occur are the following: \n \nSide effects occured during clinical studies or routine use of the vaccine or with individual hepatitis A \nand hepatitis B vaccines or with the adult formulation of Twinrix. \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• Pain and redness at the injection site \n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) \n• Drowsiness, headache \n• Nausea \n• Loss of appetite \n• Swelling or bruising at the injection site \n• Generally feeling unwell, tiredness \n• Fever equal to or greater than 37.5°C \n• Irritability \n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine) \n• Diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain \n• Rash \n• Aching muscles \n• Upper respiratory tract infection \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• Swollen glands in the neck armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy) \n• Dizziness \n• Loss of skin sensitivity to pain or touch (hypoaesthesia) \n• Feeling of pins and needles (paraesthesia) \n• Hives, itching \n• Joint pain \n• Low blood pressure \n• Flu-like symptoms such as high temperature, sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills \n \nVery rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine) \n• Reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia) \n• Purple or red brown spots visible through the skin (thrombocytopenic purpura) \n• Swelling or infection of the brain (encephalitis) \n• Degenerative disease of the brain (encephalopathy) \n• Inflammation of nerves (neuritis) \n• Numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), paralysis \n• Fits or seizures \n• Swelling of the face, mouth or throat (angioneurotic oedema) \n• Purple or reddish-purple bumps on the skin (lichen planus), serious skin rashes (erythema \n\nmultiforme) \n• Joint swelling, muscular weakness \n• Infection around the brain which may give severe headache with stiff neck and sensitivity to light \n\n(meningitis) \n• Inflammation of some blood vessels (vasculitis) \n• Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions and mimicking serum sickness). \n\nSigns of serious allergic reactions may be rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the \neyes and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of \n\n\n\n21 \n\nconsciousness.

By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.   \n \n \n5.  How to store Twinrix Paediatric  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.  The expiry date refers to \nthe last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.   \nDo not freeze.
