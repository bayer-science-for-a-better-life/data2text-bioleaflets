QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\n25 mg prolonged release suspension for injection\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 39 mg paliperidone palmitate equivalent to 25 mg paliperidone.\n\n50 mg prolonged release suspension for injection\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 78 mg paliperidone palmitate equivalent to 50 mg paliperidone.\n\n75 mg prolonged release suspension for injection\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 117 mg paliperidone palmitate equivalent to 75 mg paliperidone.\n\n100 mg prolonged release suspension for injection\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 156 mg paliperidone palmitate equivalent to 100 mg paliperidone.\n\n150 mg prolonged release suspension for injection\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 234 mg paliperidone palmitate equivalent to 150 mg paliperidone.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged release suspension for injection.\nThe suspension is white to off-white. The suspension is pH neutral (approximately 7.0).\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nXeplion is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised with \npaliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIn selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or \nrisperidone, Xeplion may be used without prior stabilisation with oral treatment if psychotic symptoms \nare mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is needed.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRecommended initiation of Xeplion is with a dose of 150 mg on treatment day 1 and 100 mg\none week later (day 8), both administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain therapeutic \n\n\n\n3\n\nconcentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). The third dose should be administered one month after the \nsecond initiation dose. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 75 mg; some patients may \nbenefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended range of 25 to 150 mg based on \nindividual patient tolerability and/or efficacy. Patients who are overweight or obese may require doses \nin the upper range (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance doses \ncan be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n\nAdjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the \nprolonged release characteristics of Xeplion should be considered (see section 5.2), as the full effect of \nmaintenance doses may not be evident for several months.\n\nSwitching from oral prolonged release paliperidone or oral risperidone to Xeplion\nXeplion should be initiated as described at the beginning of section 4.2 above. During monthly \nmaintenance treatment with Xeplion, patients previously stabilised on different doses of paliperidone \nprolonged release tablets can attain similar paliperdone steady-state exposure by injection. The \nXeplion maintenance doses needed to attain similar steady-state exposure are shown as follows:\n\nDoses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets and Xeplion needed to attain similar steady-\nstate paliperidone exposure during maintenance treatment\n\nPrevious paliperidone\nprolonged release tablet dose\n\nXeplion injection\n\n3 mg daily 25-50 mg monthly\n6 mg daily 75 mg monthly\n9 mg daily 100 mg monthly\n12 mg daily 150 mg monthly\n\nPrevious oral paliperidone or oral risperidone can be discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment \nwith Xeplion. Some patients may benefit from gradual withdrawal. Some patients switching from \nhigher paliperidone oral doses (e.g., 9-12 mg daily) to gluteal injections with Xeplion may have lower \nplasma exposure during the first 6 months after the switch. Therefore, alternatively, it could be \nconsidered to give deltoid injections for the first 6 months.\n\nSwitching from risperidone long acting injection to Xeplion\nWhen switching patients from risperidone long acting injection, initiate Xeplion therapy in place of \nthe next scheduled injection. Xeplion should then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week \ninitiation dosing regimen including the intramuscular injections (day 1 and 8, respectively) as \ndescribed in section 4.2 above is not required. Patients previously stabilised on different doses of \nrisperidone long acting injection can attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure during \nmaintenance treatment with Xeplion monthly doses according to the following:\n\nDoses of risperidone long acting injection and Xeplion needed to attain similar paliperidone \nexposure at steady-state\nPrevious risperidone long acting injection dose Xeplion injection\n\n25 mg every 2 weeks 50 mg monthly\n37.5 mg every 2 weeks 75 mg monthly\n50 mg every 2 weeks 100 mg monthly\n\nDiscontinuation of antipsychotic medicinal products should be made in accordance with appropriate \nprescribing information. If Xeplion is discontinued, its prolonged release characteristics must be \nconsidered. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) medicine should be \nre-evaluated periodically.\n\nMissed doses\n\nAvoiding missed doses\nIt is recommended that the second initiation dose of Xeplion be given one week after the first dose. To \navoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days before or after the one-week\n\n\n\n4\n\n(day 8) time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the initiation regimen are \nrecommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the \ninjection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point.\n\nIf the target date for the second Xeplion injection (day 8 ± 4 days) is missed, the recommended \nreinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's first injection.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (< 4 weeks from first injection)\nIf less than 4 weeks have elapsed since the first injection, then the patient should be administered the \nsecond injection of 100 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. A third Xeplion injection of \n75 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles should be administered 5 weeks after the first injection \n(regardless of the timing of the second injection). The normal monthly cycle of injections in either the \ndeltoid or gluteal muscle of 25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy \nshould be followed thereafter.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (4-7 weeks from first injection)\nIf 4 to 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Xeplion, resume dosing with two injections of \n100 mg in the following manner:\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible\n2. another deltoid injection one week later\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (> 7 weeks from first injection)\nIf more than 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Xeplion, initiate dosing as described for \nthe initial recommended initiation of Xeplion above.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (1 month to 6 weeks)\nAfter initiation, the recommended injection cycle of Xeplion is monthly. If less than 6 weeks have \nelapsed since the last injection, then the previously stabilised dose should be administered as soon as \npossible, followed by injections at monthly intervals.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 weeks to 6 months)\nIf more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection of Xeplion, the recommendation is as \nfollows:\n\nFor patients stabilised with doses of 25 to 100 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the same dose the patient was previously stabilised on\n2. another deltoid injection (same dose) one week later (day 8)\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nFor patients stabilised with 150 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the 100 mg dose\n2. another deltoid injection one week later (day 8) at the 100 mg dose\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 months)\nIf more than 6 months have elapsed since the last injection of Xeplion, initiate dosing as described for \nthe initial recommended initiation of Xeplion above.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nEfficacy and safety in elderly > 65 years have not been established.\n\n\n\n5\n\nIn general, recommended dosing of Xeplion for elderly patients with normal renal function is the same \nas for younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have \ndiminished renal function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see Renal impairment below for dosing \nrecommendations in patients with renal impairment).\n\nRenal impairment\nXeplion has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). For \npatients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 to < 80 mL/min), recommended \ninitiation of Xeplion is with a dose of 100 mg on treatment day 1 and 75 mg one week later, both \nadministered in the deltoid muscle. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 50 mg with a\nrange of 25 to 100 mg based on patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nXeplion is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nBased on experience with oral paliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. As paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, caution is recommended in such patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Xeplion in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nXeplion is intended for intramuscular use only. It must not be administered by any other route. It \nshould be injected slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Each injection should be \nadministered by a health care professional. Administration should be in a single injection. The dose \nshould not be given in divided injections.\n\nThe day 1 and day 8 initiation doses must each be administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain \ntherapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly \nmaintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. A switch from gluteal \nto deltoid (and vice versa) should be considered in the event of injection site pain if the injection site \ndiscomfort is not well tolerated (see section 4.8). It is also recommended to alternate between left and \nright sides (see below).\n\nFor instructions for use and handling of Xeplion, see package leaflet (information intended for medical \nor healthcare professionals).\n\nDeltoid muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for initial and maintenance administration of Xeplion into the deltoid \nmuscle is determined by the patient’s weight. For those ≥ 90 kg, the 1½ inch, 22 gauge needle \n(38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) is recommended. For those < 90 kg, the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle (25.4 mm x \n0.64 mm) is recommended. Deltoid injections should be alternated between the two deltoid muscles.\n\nGluteal muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for maintenance administration of Xeplion into the gluteal muscle is the \n1½-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm). Administration should be made into the upper-outer \nquadrant of the gluteal area. Gluteal injections should be alternated between the two gluteal muscles.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to risperidone or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state\n\nXeplion should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely psychotic states when immediate \nsymptom control is warranted.\n\nQT interval\n\nCaution should be exercised when paliperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products\nthought to prolong the QT interval.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and \nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, paliperidone should be \ndiscontinued.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of \nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including paliperidone, should be considered.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both \nmedications. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\n\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with Xeplion. \nAgranulocytosis has been reported very rarely (< 1/10,000 patients) during post-marketing \nsurveillance. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or a \ndrug-induced leucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few months of therapy and \ndiscontinuation of Xeplion should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in \nWBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should \nbe carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such \nsymptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 109/L) \nshould discontinue Xeplion and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reactions in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone \nhave been rarely reported during post-marketing experience (see sections 4.1 and 4.8).\n\nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of Xeplion; initiate general supportive measures as \nclinically appropriate and monitor the patient until signs and symptoms resolve (see sections 4.3 and \n4.8).\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\n\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes including diabetic coma \nand ketoacidosis, have been reported during treatment with paliperidone. Appropriate clinical \n\n\n\n7\n\nmonitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with \nXeplion should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, \npolyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for \nworsening of glucose control.\n\nWeight gain\n\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with Xeplion use. Weight should be monitored regularly.\n\nUse in patients with prolactin-dependent tumours\n\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with a pre-existing tumour that \nmay be prolactin-dependent.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-blocking activity.\nBased on pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials with oral \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets (3, 6, 9, and 12 mg), orthostatic hypotension was reported by \n2.5% of subjects treated with oral paliperidone compared with 0.8% of subjects treated with placebo. \nXeplion should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions \nthat predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g. dehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\n\nXeplion should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \npotentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment and \ntherefore, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Xeplion is not \nrecommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 50 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\nElderly patients with dementia\n\nXeplion has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. Xeplion should be used with caution in \nelderly patients with dementia with risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe experience from risperidone cited below is considered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\n\n\n8\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known.\n\nParkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\n\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Xeplion to patients with \nParkinson’s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with \nfrequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPriapism\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including risperidone) with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have \nbeen reported to induce priapism. During post-marketing surveillance, priapism has also been reported \nwith oral paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Patients should be informed to \nseek urgent medical care in case that priapism has not been resolved within 4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\n\nDisruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Xeplion to patients who will be \nexperiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g.,\nexercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medicinal products with \nanticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with Xeplion and preventative \nmeasures undertaken.\n\nAntiemetic effect\n\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in\nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicinal products or of \nconditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye’s syndrome and brain tumour.\n\nAdministration\n\nCare must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Xeplion into a blood vessel.\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\n\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as Xeplion (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the \nophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy \nprior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\n\n\n9\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing Xeplion with medicinal products known to prolong the QT \ninterval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics\n(e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials \n(e.g. mefloquine). This list is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\nPotential for Xeplion to affect other medicines\n\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 isozymes.\n\nGiven the primary central nervous system (CNS) effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), Xeplion\nshould be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., \nanxiolytics, most antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson’s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when Xeplion is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential, e.g., \nother antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the \nseizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, mefloquine, \netc.).\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets at steady-state (12 mg once daily) \nwith divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the \nsteady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate.\n\nNo interaction study between Xeplion and lithium has been performed, however, a pharmacokinetic \ninteraction is not likely to occur.\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect Xeplion\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role \nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of oral paliperidone with paroxetine, a \npotent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npaliperidone.\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice \ndaily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. \nThis decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone \nlikely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of \nactive substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP \nmetabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. \nOn initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of Xeplion should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. \n\n\n\n10\n\nConversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of Xeplion should be re-evaluated and \ndecreased if necessary.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of an oral paliperidone prolonged release tablet 12 mg with \ndivalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of \napproximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone, likely as a result of increased oral \nabsorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction \nwould not be expected between divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets and Xeplion\nintramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with Xeplion.\n\nConcomitant use of Xeplion with risperidone or with oral paliperidone\n\nSince paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when \nXeplion is co-administered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone for extended periods of time. \nSafety data involving concomitant use of Xeplion with other antipsychotics is limited.\n\nConcomitant use of Xeplion with psychostimulants\n\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to \nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy. Intramuscularly injected \npaliperidone palmitate and orally administered paliperidone were not teratogenic in animal studies, but \nother types of reproductive toxicity were seen (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to paliperidone \nduring the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. Xeplion should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. Xeplion should not be used \nwhile breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines until their \nindividual susceptibility to Xeplion is known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) most frequently reported in clinical trials were insomnia, \nheadache, anxiety, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, parkinsonism, weight \n\n\n\n11\n\nincreased, akathisia, agitation, sedation/somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, musculoskeletal \npain, tachycardia, tremor, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, and dystonia. Of these, \nakathisia and sedation/somnolence appeared to be dose-related.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following are all ADRs that were reported with paliperidone by frequency category estimated \nfrom paliperidone palmitate clinical trials. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not

reactions is qualified as “not known” because they were not observed in paliperidone \npalmitate clinical trials. They were either derived from spontaneous post-marketing reports and frequency cannot be \ndetermined, or they were derived from risperidone (any formulation) or oral paliperidone clinical trials data and/or \npost-marketing reports.\n\nb\nRefer to ‘Hyperprolactinaemia’ below.\n\nc\nRefer to ‘Extrapyramidal symptoms’ below.\n\nd\nIn placebo-controlled trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.32% in Xeplion-treated subjects compared to a rate of 0.39% \nin placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.65% in all paliperidone palmitate -treated subjects\n\ne\nInsomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema includes:\ngeneralised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema. Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation delayed, menstruation \nirregular, oligomenorrhoea\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\nRarely, cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with Xeplion have been reported during \npost-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral \npaliperidone (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions\nThe most commonly reported injection site related adverse reaction was pain. The majority of these \nreactions were reported to be of mild to moderate severity. Subject evaluations of injection site pain \nbased on a visual analogue scale tended to lessen in frequency and intensity over time in all Phase 2 \nand 3 studies with Xeplion. Injections into the deltoid were perceived as slightly more painful than \ncorresponding gluteal injections. Other injection site reactions were mostly mild in intensity and \nincluded induration (common), pruritus (uncommon) and nodules (rare).\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nEPS included a pooled analysis of the following terms: parkinsonism (includes salivary \nhypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, \nhypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian \ngait, glabellar reflex abnormal, and parkinsonian rest tremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, \nrestlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, \nchoreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle \ncontractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial \nspasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, \nand trismus), and tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included that do \nnot necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin.\n\nWeight gain\nIn the 13-week study involving the 150 mg initiation dosing, the proportion of subjects with an \nabnormal weight increase ≥ 7% showed a dose-related trend, with a 5% incidence rate in the placebo \n\n\n\n14\n\ngroup compared with rates of 6%, 8% and 13% in the Xeplion 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg groups, \nrespectively.\n\nDuring the 33-week open-label transition/maintenance period of the long-term recurrence prevention \ntrial, 12% of Xeplion-treated subjects met this criterion (weight gain of ≥ 7% from double-blind phase \nto endpoint); the mean (SD) weight change from open-label baseline was + 0.7 (4.79) kg.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIn clinical trials, median increases in serum prolactin were observed in subjects of both genders who \nreceived Xeplion. Adverse reactions that may suggest increase in prolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, \ngalactorrhoea, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia) were reported overall in < 1% of subjects.\n\nClass effects\n\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest, and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics.\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis, have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products (frequency unknown).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone’s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. In the case of acute overdose, \nthe possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.\n\nManagement\n\nConsideration should be given to the prolonged release nature of the medicinal product and the long \nelimination half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery. There is no specific \nantidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should be employed. Establish and maintain a \nclear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous\nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. In \ncase of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13\n\nXeplion contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly \nless, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and \n(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less \ncatalepsy and decreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central \nserotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nAcute treatment of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Xeplion in the acute treatment of schizophrenia was established in four short-term \n(one 9-week and three 13-week) double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of \nacutely relapsed adult inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The fixed doses of \nXeplion in these studies were given on days 1, 8, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on \nday 64 of the 13-week studies. No additional oral antipsychotic supplementation was needed during \nthe acute treatment of schizophrenia with Xeplion. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a \ndecrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores as shown in the table below. \nThe PANSS is a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive \nsymptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and \nanxiety/depression. Functioning was evaluated using the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. \nThe PSP is a validated clinician rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in four \ndomains: socially useful activities (work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care and \ndisturbing and aggressive behaviours.\n\nIn a 13-week study (n = 636) comparing three fixed doses of Xeplion (initial deltoid injection of \n150 mg followed by 3 gluteal or deltoid doses of either 25 mg/4 weeks, 100 mg/4 weeks or \n150 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of Xeplion were superior to placebo in improving the \nPANSS total score. In this study, both the 100 mg/4 weeks and 150 mg /4 weeks, but not the \n25 mg/4 weeks, treatment groups demonstrated statistical superiority to placebo for the PSP score. \nThese results support efficacy across the entire duration of treatment and improvement in PANSS and \nwas observed as early as day 4 with significant separation from placebo in the 25 mg and 150 mg\nXeplion groups by day 8.\n\nThe results of the other studies yielded statistically significant results in favour of Xeplion, except for \nthe 50 mg dose in one study (see table below).\n\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change From Baseline to \nEnd Point- LOCF for Studies R092670-SCH-201, R092670-PSY-3003, R092670-PSY-3004 and \n\nR092670-PSY-3007: Primary Efficacy Analysis Set\nPlacebo 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 150 mg\n\nR092670-PSY-3007*\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 160\n86.8 (10.31)\n-2.9 (19.26)\n\n--\n\nn = 155\n86.9 (11.99)\n-8.0 (19.90)\n\n0.034\n--\n\nn = 161\n86.2 (10.77)\n-11.6 (17.63)\n\n< 0.001\n\nn = 160\n88.4 (11.70)\n-13.2 (18.48)\n\n< 0.001\n\nR092670-PSY-3003\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 132\n92.4 (12.55)\n-4.1 (21.01)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 93\n89.9 (10.78)\n-7.9 (18.71)\n\n0.193\n\nn = 94\n90.1 (11.66)\n-11.0 (19.06)\n\n0.019\n\nn = 30\n92.2 (11.72)\n-5.5 (19.78)\n\n--\n\n\n\n16\n\nR092670-PSY-3004\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 125\n90.7 (12.22)\n-7.0 (20.07)\n\n--\n\nn = 129\n90.7 (12.25)\n-13.6 (21.45)\n\n0.015\n\nn = 128\n91.2 (12.02)\n-13.2 (20.14)\n\n0.017\n\nn = 131\n90.8 (11.70)\n-16.1 (20.36)\n\n< 0.001\n--\n\nR092670-SCH-201\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 66\n87.8 (13.90)\n6.2 (18.25)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 63\n88.0 (12.39)\n-5.2 (21.52)\n\n0.001\n\nn = 68\n85.2 (11.09)\n-7.8 (19.40)\n\n< 0.0001\n--\n\n* For Study R092670-PSY-3007 an initiation dose of 150 mg was given to all subjects in the Xeplion treatment groups \non day 1 followed by the assigned dose afterwards.\n\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.\n\nMaintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Xeplion in maintaining symptomatic control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia \nwas established in a longer-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study involving 849 \nnon-elderly adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. This study included a 33-week \nopen-label acute treatment and stabilisation phase, a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled \nphase to observe for relapse, and a 52-week open-label extension period. In this study, doses of \nXeplion included 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg administered monthly; the 75 mg dose was allowed only in \nthe 52-week open-label extension. Subjects initially received flexible doses (25-100 mg) of Xeplion\nduring a 9-week transition period, followed by a 24-week maintenance period, where subjects were \nrequired to have a PANSS score of ≤ 75. Dosing adjustments were only allowed in the first 12 weeks \nof the maintenance period. A total of 410 stabilised patients were randomised to either Xeplion\n(median duration 171 days [range 1 day to 407 days]) or to placebo (median duration 105 days [range \n8 days to 441 days]) until they experienced a relapse of schizophrenia symptoms in the variable length \ndouble-blind phase. The trial was stopped early for efficacy reasons as a significantly longer time to \nrelapse (p < 0.0001, Figure 1) was seen in patients treated with Xeplion compared to placebo (hazard \nratio = 4.32; 95% CI: 2.4-7.7).\n\n\n\n17\n\nDays since Randomisation\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300\n\nE\nst\n\nim\na\n\nte\nd\n\n P\ne\n\nrc\ne\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nS\nu\n\nb\nje\n\nct\ns \n\nW\nit\nh\n\no\nu\n\nt \nR\n\ne\nla\n\np\nse\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPlacebo N=156\n\nXEPLION N=156\nLog-rank test, P-value<0.0001\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Relapse – Interim Analysis (Intent-to-Treat Interim \nAnalysis Set)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXeplion in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia. See section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nPaliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester prodrug of paliperidone. Due to its extremely low water \nsolubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being \nhydrolysed to paliperidone and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Following a single \nintramuscular dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach maximum \nplasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 13 days. The release of the active substance starts as early \nas day 1 and lasts for at least 4 months.\n\nFollowing intramuscular injection of single doses (25-150 mg) in the deltoid muscle, on average, a \n28% higher Cmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The two initial deltoid \nintramuscular injections of 150 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on day 8 help attain therapeutic \nconcentrations rapidly. The release profile and dosing regimen of Xeplion results in sustained \ntherapeutic concentrations. The total exposure of paliperidone following Xeplion administration was \ndose-proportional over a 25-150 mg dose range, and less than dose-proportional for Cmax for doses \nexceeding 50 mg. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for a Xeplion dose of 100 mg was 1.8 \nfollowing gluteal administration and 2.2 following deltoid administration. The median apparent \n\n\n\n18\n\nhalf-life of paliperidone following Xeplion administration over the dose range of 25-150 mg ranged \nfrom 25-49 days.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of paliperidone palmitate following Xeplion administration is 100%.\n\nFollowing administration of paliperidone palmitate the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone \ninterconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6-1.8.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nOne week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, \n59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively \nmetabolised in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine \nand 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted \nfor more than 6.5% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole \nscission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of \npaliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism \nof paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the \napparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive \nmetabolisers and poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes \nshowed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of medicinal products\nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nLong acting paliperidone palmitate injection versus oral prolonged release paliperidone\n\nXeplion is designed to deliver paliperidone over a monthly period while prolonged release oral \npaliperidone is administered on a daily basis. The initiation regimen for Xeplion (150 mg/100 mg in \nthe deltoid muscle on day 1/day 8) was designed to rapidly attain steady-state paliperidone \nconcentrations when initiating therapy without the use of oral supplementation.\n\nIn general, overall initiation plasma levels with Xeplion were within the exposure range observed with \n6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone. The use of the Xeplion initiation regimen allowed \npatients to stay in this exposure window of 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone even on \ntrough pre-dose days (day 8 and day 36). Because of the difference in median pharmacokinetic \nprofiles between the two medicinal products, caution should be exercised when making a direct \ncomparison of their pharmacokinetic properties.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Although Xeplion was not studied on patients \nwith hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment. In a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were similar to those of healthy \nsubjects. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe disposition of a single oral dose paliperidone 3 mg prolonged release tablet was studied in \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing \nestimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired \nrenal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to \n\n\n\n19\n\n< 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an \naverage increase in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5, 2.6, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy \nsubjects. Based on a limited number of observations with Xeplion in subjects with mild renal \nimpairment and pharmacokinetic simulations, a reduced dose is recommended (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of age related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nBody mass index (BMI)/body weight\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with paliperidone palmitate have shown somewhat lower (10-20%) plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone in patients who are overweight or obese in comparison with normal \nweight patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRace\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis of data from studies with oral paliperidone revealed no evidence \nof race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following Xeplion administration.\n\nGender\n\nNo clinically significant differences were observed between men and women.\n\nSmoking status\n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. Effect of \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was not studied with Xeplion. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis based on data with oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets showed a \nslightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with non-smokers. The difference is \nunlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate (the 1-month \nformulation) and orally administered paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological \neffects, such as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. In animals \ntreated with paliperidone palmitate an inflammatory reaction was seen at the intramuscular injection \nsite. Occasionally abscess formation occurred.\n\nIn rat reproduction studies with oral risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats \nand humans, adverse effects were seen on the birth weight and survival of the offspring. No \nembryotoxicity or malformations were observed following intramuscular administration of \npaliperidone palmitate to pregnant rats up to the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) corresponding to \n4.1 times the exposure level in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 150 mg. Other \ndopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have caused negative effects on \nlearning and motor development in the offspring.\n\nPaliperidone palmitate and paliperidone were not genotoxic. In oral carcinogenicity studies of \nrisperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas \nadenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were seen. The carcinogenic potential \nof intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/month. \nMale rats showed a statistically significant increase in mammary gland adenomas and carcinomas at \n30 and 60 mg/kg/month which is 1.2 and 2.2 times the exposure level at the maximum recommended \n\n\n\n20\n\nhuman 150 mg dose. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2 antagonism and \nhyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of human risk is \nunknown.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged release suspension for injection.\nThe suspension is white to off-white. The suspension is pH neutral (approximately 7.0).\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nXeplion is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised with \npaliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIn selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or \nrisperidone, Xeplion may be used without prior stabilisation with oral treatment if psychotic symptoms \nare mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is needed.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRecommended initiation of Xeplion is with a dose of 150 mg on treatment day 1 and 100 mg\none week later (day 8), both administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain therapeutic \nconcentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). The third dose should be administered one month after the \nsecond initiation dose. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 75 mg; some patients may \nbenefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended range of 25 to 150 mg based on \nindividual patient tolerability and/or efficacy. Patients who are overweight or obese may require doses \nin the upper range (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance doses \ncan be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n\nAdjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the \nprolonged release characteristics of Xeplion should be considered (see section 5.2), as the full effect of \nmaintenance doses may not be evident for several months.\n\nSwitching from oral prolonged release paliperidone or oral risperidone to Xeplion\nXeplion should be initiated as described at the beginning of section 4.2 above. During monthly \nmaintenance treatment with Xeplion, patients previously stabilised on different doses of paliperidone \nprolonged release tablets can attain similar paliperdone steady-state exposure by injection. The \nXeplion maintenance doses needed to attain similar steady-state exposure are shown as follows:\n\n\n\n23\n\nDoses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets and Xeplion needed to attain similar steady-\nstate paliperidone exposure during maintenance treatment\n\nPrevious paliperidone\nprolonged release tablet dose\n\nXeplion injection\n\n3 mg daily 25-50 mg monthly\n6 mg daily 75 mg monthly\n9 mg daily 100 mg monthly\n12 mg daily 150 mg monthly\n\nPrevious oral paliperidone or oral risperidone can be discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment \nwith Xeplion. Some patients may benefit from gradual withdrawal. Some patients switching from \nhigher paliperidone oral doses (e.g., 9-12 mg daily) to gluteal injections with Xeplion may have lower \nplasma exposure during the first 6 months after the switch. Therefore, alternatively, it could be \nconsidered to give deltoid injections for the first 6 months.\n\nSwitching from risperidone long acting injection to Xeplion\nWhen switching patients from risperidone long acting injection, initiate Xeplion therapy in place of \nthe next scheduled injection. Xeplion should then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week \ninitiation dosing regimen including the intramuscular injections (day 1 and 8, respectively) as \ndescribed in section 4.2 above is not required. Patients previously stabilised on different doses of \nrisperidone long acting injection can attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure during \nmaintenance treatment with Xeplion monthly doses according to the following:\n\nDoses of risperidone long acting injection and Xeplion needed to attain similar paliperidone \nexposure at steady-state\nPrevious risperidone long acting injection dose Xeplion injection\n\n25 mg every 2 weeks 50 mg monthly\n37.5 mg every 2 weeks 75 mg monthly\n50 mg every 2 weeks 100 mg monthly\n\nDiscontinuation of antipsychotic medicinal products should be made in accordance with appropriate \nprescribing information. If Xeplion is discontinued, its prolonged release characteristics must be \nconsidered. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) medicine should be \nre-evaluated periodically.\n\nMissed doses\n\nAvoiding missed doses\nIt is recommended that the second initiation dose of Xeplion be given one week after the first dose. To \navoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days before or after the one-week \n(day 8) time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the initiation regimen are \nrecommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the \ninjection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point.\n\nIf the target date for the second Xeplion injection (day 8 ± 4 days) is missed, the recommended \nreinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's first injection.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (< 4 weeks from first injection)\nIf less than 4 weeks have elapsed since the first injection, then the patient should be administered the \nsecond injection of 100 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. A third Xeplion injection of \n75 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles should be administered 5 weeks after the first injection \n(regardless of the timing of the second injection). The normal monthly cycle of injections in either the \ndeltoid or gluteal muscle of 25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy \nshould be followed thereafter.\n\n\n\n24\n\nMissed second initiation dose (4-7 weeks from first injection)\nIf 4 to 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Xeplion, resume dosing with two injections of \n100 mg in the following manner:\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible\n2. another deltoid injection one week later\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (> 7 weeks from first injection)\nIf more than 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Xeplion, initiate dosing as described for \nthe initial recommended initiation of Xeplion above.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (1 month to 6 weeks)\nAfter initiation, the recommended injection cycle of Xeplion is monthly. If less than 6 weeks have \nelapsed since the last injection, then the previously stabilised dose should be administered as soon as \npossible, followed by injections at monthly intervals.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 weeks to 6 months)\nIf more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection of Xeplion, the recommendation is as \nfollows:\n\nFor patients stabilised with doses of 25 to 100 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the same dose the patient was previously stabilised on\n2. another deltoid injection (same dose) one week later (day 8)\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nFor patients stabilised with 150 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the 100 mg dose\n2. another deltoid injection one week later (day 8) at the 100 mg dose\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 months)\nIf more than 6 months have elapsed since the last injection of Xeplion, initiate dosing as described for \nthe initial recommended initiation of Xeplion above.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nEfficacy and safety in elderly > 65 years have not been established.\n\nIn general, recommended dosing of Xeplion for elderly patients with normal renal function is the same \nas for younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have \ndiminished renal function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see Renal impairment below for dosing \nrecommendations in patients with renal impairment).\n\nRenal impairment\nXeplion has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). For \npatients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 to < 80 mL/min), recommended \ninitiation of Xeplion is with a dose of 100 mg on treatment day 1 and 75 mg one week later, both \nadministered in the deltoid muscle. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 50 mg with a \nrange of 25 to 100 mg based on patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nXeplion is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n25\n\nHepatic impairment\nBased on experience with oral paliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. As paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, caution is recommended in such patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Xeplion in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nXeplion is intended for intramuscular use only. It must not be administered by any other route. It \nshould be injected slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Each injection should be \nadministered by a health care professional. Administration should be in a single injection. The dose \nshould not be given in divided injections.\n\nThe day 1 and day 8 initiation doses must each be administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain \ntherapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly \nmaintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. A switch from gluteal \nto deltoid (and vice versa) should be considered in the event of injection site pain if the injection site \ndiscomfort is not well tolerated (see section 4.8). It is also recommended to alternate between left and \nright sides (see below).\n\nFor instructions for use and handling of Xeplion, see package leaflet (information intended for medical \nor healthcare professionals).\n\nDeltoid muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for initial and maintenance administration of Xeplion into the deltoid \nmuscle is determined by the patient’s weight. For those ≥ 90 kg, the 1½ inch, 22 gauge needle \n(38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) is recommended. For those < 90 kg, the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle (25.4 mm x \n0.64 mm) is recommended. Deltoid injections should be alternated between the two deltoid muscles.\n\nGluteal muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for maintenance administration of Xeplion into the gluteal muscle is the \n1½-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm). Administration should be made into the upper-outer \nquadrant of the gluteal area. Gluteal injections should be alternated between the two gluteal muscles.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to risperidone or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state\n\nXeplion should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely psychotic states when immediate \nsymptom control is warranted.\n\nQT interval\n\nCaution should be exercised when paliperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products \nthought to prolong the QT interval.\n\n\n\n26\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and \nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, paliperidone should be \ndiscontinued.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of \nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including paliperidone, should be considered.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both \nmedications. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\n\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with Xeplion. \nAgranulocytosis has been reported very rarely (< 1/10,000 patients) during post-marketing \nsurveillance. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or a \ndrug-induced leucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few months of therapy and \ndiscontinuation of Xeplion should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in \nWBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should \nbe carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such \nsymptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 109/L) \nshould discontinue Xeplion and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reactions in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone \nhave been rarely reported during post-marketing experience (see sections 4.1 and 4.8).\n\nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of Xeplion; initiate general supportive measures as \nclinically appropriate and monitor the patient until signs and symptoms resolve (see sections 4.3 and \n4.8).\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\n\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes including diabetic coma \nand ketoacidosis, have been reported during treatment with paliperidone. Appropriate clinical \nmonitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with \nXeplion should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, \npolyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for \nworsening of glucose control.\n\nWeight gain\n\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with Xeplion use. Weight should be monitored regularly.\n\nUse in patients with prolactin-dependent tumours\n\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \n\n\n\n27\n\ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with a pre-existing tumour that \nmay be prolactin-dependent.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-blocking activity.\nBased on pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials with oral \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets (3, 6, 9, and 12 mg), orthostatic hypotension was reported by \n2.5% of subjects treated with oral paliperidone compared with 0.8% of subjects treated with placebo. \nXeplion should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions \nthat predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\n\nXeplion should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \npotentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment and \ntherefore, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Xeplion is not \nrecommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 50 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\nElderly patients with dementia\n\nXeplion has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. Xeplion should be used with caution in \nelderly patients with dementia with risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe experience from risperidone cited below is considered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known.\n\nParkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\n\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Xeplion to patients with \nParkinson’s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with \nfrequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n\n\n28\n\nPriapism\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including risperidone) with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have \nbeen reported to induce priapism. During post-marketing surveillance, priapism has also been reported \nwith oral paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Patients should be informed to \nseek urgent medical care in case that priapism has not been resolved within 4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\n\nDisruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Xeplion to patients who will be \nexperiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g.,\nexercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medicinal products with \nanticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with Xeplion and preventative \nmeasures undertaken.\n\nAntiemetic effect\n\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in\nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicinal products or of \nconditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye’s syndrome and brain tumour.\n\nAdministration\n\nCare must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Xeplion into a blood vessel.\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\n\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as Xeplion (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the \nophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy \nprior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing Xeplion with medicinal products known to prolong the QT \ninterval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics\n(e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials \n(e.g. mefloquine). This list is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\n\n\n29\n\nPotential for Xeplion to affect other medicines\n\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 isozymes.\n\nGiven the primary central nervous system (CNS) effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), Xeplion\nshould be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., \nanxiolytics, most antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson’s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when Xeplion is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential, e.g., \nother antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the \nseizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, mefloquine, \netc.).\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets at steady-state (12 mg once daily) \nwith divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the \nsteady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate.\n\nNo interaction study between Xeplion and lithium has been performed, however, a pharmacokinetic \ninteraction is not likely to occur.\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect Xeplion\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role\nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of oral paliperidone with paroxetine, a \npotent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npaliperidone.\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice \ndaily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. \nThis decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone\nlikely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of \nactive substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP \nmetabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. \nOn initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of Xeplion should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. \nConversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of Xeplion should be re-evaluated and \ndecreased if necessary.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of an oral paliperidone prolonged release tablet 12 mg with \ndivalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of \napproximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone, likely as a result of increased oral \nabsorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction \nwould not be expected between divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets and Xeplion\nintramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with Xeplion.\n\n\n\n30\n\nConcomitant use of Xeplion with risperidone or with oral paliperidone\n\nSince paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when \nXeplion is co-administered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone for extended periods of time. \nSafety data involving concomitant use of Xeplion with other antipsychotics is limited.\n\nConcomitant use of Xeplion with psychostimulants\n\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to \nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy. Intramuscularly injected \npaliperidone palmitate and orally administered paliperidone were not teratogenic in animal studies, but \nother types of reproductive toxicity were seen (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to paliperidone \nduring the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. Xeplion should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. Xeplion should not be used \nwhile breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines until their \nindividual susceptibility to Xeplion is known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) most frequently reported in clinical trials were insomnia, \nheadache, anxiety, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, parkinsonism, weight \nincreased, akathisia, agitation, sedation/somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, musculoskeletal \npain, tachycardia, tremor, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, and dystonia. Of these, \nakathisia and sedation/somnolence appeared to be dose-related.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following are all ADRs that were reported with paliperidone by frequency category estimated \nfrom paliperidone palmitate clinical trials. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not

observed in paliperidone \npalmitate clinical trials. They were either derived from spontaneous post-marketing reports and frequency cannot be \ndetermined, or they were derived from risperidone (any formulation) or oral paliperidone clinical trials data and/or \npost-marketing reports.\n\nb\nRefer to ‘Hyperprolactinaemia’ below.\n\nc\nRefer to ‘Extrapyramidal symptoms’ below.\n\nd\nIn placebo-controlled trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.32% in Xeplion-treated subjects compared to a rate of 0.39% \nin placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.65% in all paliperidone palmitate -treated subjects\n\ne\nInsomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema includes:\ngeneralised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema. Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation delayed, menstruation \nirregular, oligomenorrhoea\n\n\n\n33\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\nRarely, cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with Xeplion have been reported during \npost-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral \npaliperidone (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions\nThe most commonly reported injection site related adverse reaction was pain. The majority of these \nreactions were reported to be of mild to moderate severity. Subject evaluations of injection site pain \nbased on a visual analogue scale tended to lessen in frequency and intensity over time in all Phase 2 \nand 3 studies with Xeplion. Injections into the deltoid were perceived as slightly more painful than \ncorresponding gluteal injections. Other injection site reactions were mostly mild in intensity and \nincluded induration (common), pruritus (uncommon) and nodules (rare).\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nEPS included a pooled analysis of the following terms: parkinsonism (includes salivary \nhypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, \nhypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian \ngait, glabellar reflex abnormal, and parkinsonian rest tremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, \nrestlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, \nchoreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle \ncontractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial \nspasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, \nand trismus), and tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included that do \nnot necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin.\n\nWeight gain\nIn the 13-week study involving the 150 mg initiation dosing, the proportion of subjects with an \nabnormal weight increase ≥ 7% showed a dose-related trend, with a 5% incidence rate in the placebo \ngroup compared with rates of 6%, 8% and 13% in the Xeplion 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg groups, \nrespectively.\n\nDuring the 33-week open-label transition/maintenance period of the long-term recurrence prevention \ntrial, 12% of Xeplion-treated subjects met this criterion (weight gain of ≥ 7% from double-blind phase \nto endpoint); the mean (SD) weight change from open-label baseline was + 0.7 (4.79) kg.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIn clinical trials, median increases in serum prolactin were observed in subjects of both genders who \nreceived Xeplion. Adverse reactions that may suggest increase in prolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, \ngalactorrhoea, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia) were reported overall in < 1% of subjects.\n\nClass effects\n\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest, and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics.\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis, have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products (frequency unknown).\n\n\n\n34\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone’s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. In the case of acute overdose, \nthe possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.\n\nManagement\n\nConsideration should be given to the prolonged release nature of the medicinal product and the long \nelimination half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery. There is no specific \nantidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should be employed. Establish and maintain a \nclear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous \nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. In \ncase of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13\n\nXeplion contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly \nless, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and \n(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less \ncatalepsy and decreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central \nserotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nAcute treatment of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Xeplion in the acute treatment of schizophrenia was established in four short-term \n(one 9-week and three 13-week) double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of \nacutely relapsed adult inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The fixed doses of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n35\n\nXeplion in these studies were given on days 1, 8, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on \nday 64 of the 13-week studies. No additional oral antipsychotic supplementation was needed during \nthe acute treatment of schizophrenia with Xeplion. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a \ndecrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores as shown in the table below. \nThe PANSS is a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive \nsymptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and \nanxiety/depression. Functioning was evaluated using the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. \nThe PSP is a validated clinician rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in four \ndomains: socially useful activities (work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care and \ndisturbing and aggressive behaviours.\n\nIn a 13-week study (n = 636) comparing three fixed doses of Xeplion (initial deltoid injection of \n150 mg followed by 3 gluteal or deltoid doses of either 25 mg/4 weeks, 100 mg/4 weeks or \n150 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of Xeplion were superior to placebo in improving the \nPANSS total score. In this study, both the 100 mg/4 weeks and 150 mg /4 weeks, but not the \n25 mg/4 weeks, treatment groups demonstrated statistical superiority to placebo for the PSP score. \nThese results support efficacy across the entire duration of treatment and improvement in PANSS and \nwas observed as early as day 4 with significant separation from placebo in the 25 mg and 150 mg\nXeplion groups by day 8.\n\nThe results of the other studies yielded statistically significant results in favour of Xeplion, except for \nthe 50 mg dose in one study (see table below).\n\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change From Baseline to \nEnd Point- LOCF for Studies R092670-SCH-201, R092670-PSY-3003, R092670-PSY-3004 and \n\nR092670-PSY-3007: Primary Efficacy Analysis Set\nPlacebo 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 150 mg\n\nR092670-PSY-3007*\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 160\n86.8 (10.31)\n-2.9 (19.26)\n\n--\n\nn = 155\n86.9 (11.99)\n-8.0 (19.90)\n\n0.034\n--\n\nn = 161\n86.2 (10.77)\n-11.6 (17.63)\n\n< 0.001\n\nn = 160\n88.4 (11.70)\n-13.2 (18.48)\n\n< 0.001\n\nR092670-PSY-3003\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 132\n92.4 (12.55)\n-4.1 (21.01)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 93\n89.9 (10.78)\n-7.9 (18.71)\n\n0.193\n\nn = 94\n90.1 (11.66)\n-11.0 (19.06)\n\n0.019\n\nn = 30\n92.2 (11.72)\n-5.5 (19.78)\n\n--\n\nR092670-PSY-3004\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 125\n90.7 (12.22)\n-7.0 (20.07)\n\n--\n\nn = 129\n90.7 (12.25)\n-13.6 (21.45)\n\n0.015\n\nn = 128\n91.2 (12.02)\n-13.2 (20.14)\n\n0.017\n\nn = 131\n90.8 (11.70)\n-16.1 (20.36)\n\n< 0.001\n--\n\nR092670-SCH-201\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 66\n87.8 (13.90)\n6.2 (18.25)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 63\n88.0 (12.39)\n-5.2 (21.52)\n\n0.001\n\nn = 68\n85.2 (11.09)\n-7.8 (19.40)\n\n< 0.0001\n--\n\n* For Study R092670-PSY-3007 an initiation dose of 150 mg was given to all subjects in the Xeplion treatment groups \non day 1 followed by the assigned dose afterwards.\n\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.\n\nMaintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Xeplion in maintaining symptomatic control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia \nwas established in a longer-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study involving 849 \nnon-elderly adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. This study included a 33-week \nopen-label acute treatment and stabilisation phase, a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled \nphase to observe for relapse, and a 52-week open-label extension period. In this study, doses of \nXeplion included 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg administered monthly; the 75 mg dose was allowed only in \nthe 52-week open-label extension. Subjects initially received flexible doses (25-100 mg) of Xeplion\nduring a 9-week transition period, followed by a 24-week maintenance period, where subjects were \n\n\n\n36\n\nrequired to have a PANSS score of ≤ 75. Dosing adjustments were only allowed in the first 12 weeks \nof the maintenance period. A total of 410 stabilised patients were randomised to either Xeplion\n(median duration 171 days [range 1 day to 407 days]) or to placebo (median duration 105 days [range \n8 days to 441 days]) until they experienced a relapse of schizophrenia symptoms in the variable length \ndouble-blind phase. The trial was stopped early for efficacy reasons as a significantly longer time to \nrelapse (p < 0.0001, Figure 1) was seen in patients treated with Xeplion compared to placebo (hazard \nratio = 4.32; 95% CI: 2.4-7.7).\n\nDays since Randomisation\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300\n\nE\nst\n\nim\na\n\nte\nd\n\n P\ne\n\nrc\ne\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nS\nu\n\nb\nje\n\nct\ns\n W\n\nit\nh\n\no\nu\n\nt \nR\n\ne\nla\n\np\ns\ne\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPlacebo N=156\n\nXEPLION N=156\nLog-rank test, P-value<0.0001\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Relapse – Interim Analysis (Intent-to-Treat Interim \nAnalysis Set)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXeplion in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia. See section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nPaliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester prodrug of paliperidone. Due to its extremely low water \nsolubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being \nhydrolysed to paliperidone and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Following a single \nintramuscular dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach maximum \nplasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 13 days. The release of the active substance starts as early \nas day 1 and lasts for at least 4 months.\n\nFollowing intramuscular injection of single doses (25-150 mg) in the deltoid muscle, on average, a \n28% higher Cmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The two initial deltoid \n\n\n\n37\n\nintramuscular injections of 150 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on day 8 help attain therapeutic \nconcentrations rapidly. The release profile and dosing regimen of Xeplion results in sustained \ntherapeutic concentrations. The total exposure of paliperidone following Xeplion administration was \ndose-proportional over a 25-150 mg dose range, and less than dose-proportional for Cmax for doses \nexceeding 50 mg. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for a Xeplion dose of 100 mg was 1.8 \nfollowing gluteal administration and 2.2 following deltoid administration. The median apparent \nhalf-life of paliperidone following Xeplion administration over the dose range of 25-150 mg ranged \nfrom 25-49 days.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of paliperidone palmitate following Xeplion administration is 100%.\n\nFollowing administration of paliperidone palmitate the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone \ninterconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6-1.8.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nOne week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, \n59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively \nmetabolised in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine \nand 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted \nfor more than 6.5% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole \nscission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of \npaliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism \nof paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the \napparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive \nmetabolisers and poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes \nshowed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of medicinal products \nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nLong acting paliperidone palmitate injection versus oral prolonged release paliperidone\n\nXeplion is designed to deliver paliperidone over a monthly period while prolonged release oral \npaliperidone is administered on a daily basis. The initiation regimen for Xeplion (150 mg/100 mg in \nthe deltoid muscle on day 1/day 8) was designed to rapidly attain steady-state paliperidone \nconcentrations when initiating therapy without the use of oral supplementation.\n\nIn general, overall initiation plasma levels with Xeplion were within the exposure range observed with \n6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone. The use of the Xeplion initiation regimen allowed \npatients to stay in this exposure window of 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone even on \ntrough pre-dose days (day 8 and day 36). Because of the difference in median pharmacokinetic \nprofiles between the two medicinal products, caution should be exercised when making a direct \ncomparison of their pharmacokinetic properties.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Although Xeplion was not studied on patients \nwith hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment. In a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were similar to those of healthy \nsubjects. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n\n\n38\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe disposition of a single oral dose paliperidone 3 mg prolonged release tablet was studied in \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing \nestimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired \nrenal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to \n< 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an \naverage increase in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5, 2.6, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy \nsubjects. Based on a limited number of observations with Xeplion in subjects with mild renal \nimpairment and pharmacokinetic simulations, a reduced dose is recommended (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of age related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nBody mass index (BMI)/body weight\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with paliperidone palmitate have shown somewhat lower (10-20%) plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone in patients who are overweight or obese in comparison with normal \nweight patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRace\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis of data from studies with oral paliperidone revealed no evidence \nof race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following Xeplion administration.\n\nGender\n\nNo clinically significant differences were observed between men and women.\n\nSmoking status\n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. Effect of \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was not studied with Xeplion. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis based on data with oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets showed a \nslightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with non-smokers. The difference is \nunlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate (the 1-month \nformulation) and orally administered paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological \neffects, such as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. In animals \ntreated with paliperidone palmitate an inflammatory reaction was seen at the intramuscular injection \nsite. Occasionally abscess formation occurred.\n\nIn rat reproduction studies with oral risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats \nand humans, adverse effects were seen on the birth weight and survival of the offspring. No \nembryotoxicity or malformations were observed following intramuscular administration of \npaliperidone palmitate to pregnant rats up to the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) corresponding to \n4.1 times the exposure level in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 150 mg. Other \ndopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have caused negative effects on \nlearning and motor development in the offspring.\n\n\n\n39\n\nPaliperidone palmitate and paliperidone were not genotoxic. In oral carcinogenicity studies of \nrisperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas \nadenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were seen. The carcinogenic potential \nof intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/month. \nMale rats showed a statistically significant increase in mammary gland adenomas and carcinomas at \n30 and 60 mg/kg/month which is 1.2 and 2.2 times the exposure level at the maximum recommended \nhuman 150 mg dose. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2 antagonism and \nhyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of human risk is \nunknown.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Xeplion is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Xeplion\n3. How to use Xeplion\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Xeplion\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Xeplion is and what it is used for\n\nXeplion contains the active substance paliperidone which belongs to the class of antipsychotic \nmedicines and is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia in adult patients \nstabilised on paliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIf you have shown responsiveness to paliperidone or risperidone in the past and have mild to moderate \nsymptoms your doctor may start treatment with Xeplion without prior stabilisation with paliperidone \nor risperidone.\n\nSchizophrenia is a disease with “positive” and “negative” symptoms. Positive means an excess of \nsymptoms that are not normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or \nsee things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), \nor feel unusually suspicious of others. Negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are \nnormally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not \nrespond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. People with this \ndisease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense.\n\nXeplion can help alleviate the symptoms of your disease and stop your symptoms from coming back.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Xeplion\n\nDo not use Xeplion\n- if you are allergic to paliperidone or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you are allergic to another antipsychotic medicine including the substance risperidone.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Xeplion.\n\n\n\n69\n\nThis medicine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with \ndementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke \nor death (see section 4, possible side effects).\n\nAll medicines have side effects and some of the side effects of this medicine can worsen the symptoms \nof other medical conditions. For that reason, it is important to discuss with your doctor any of the \nfollowing conditions which can potentially worsen during treatment with this medicine:\n\n- if you have Parkinson’s disease\n- if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature \n\nand muscle stiffness (also known as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)\n- if you have ever experienced abnormal movements of the tongue or face (Tardive Dyskinesia)\n- if you know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or may not \n\nhave been caused by other medicines)\n- if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes\n- if you have had breast cancer or a tumour in the pituitary gland in your brain\n- if you have a heart disease or heart disease treatment that makes you prone to low blood \n\npressure\n- if you have low blood pressure when you stand up or sit up suddenly\n- if you have epilepsy\n- if you have kidney problems\n- if you have liver problems\n- if you have prolonged and/or painful erection\n- if you have problems with controlling core body temperature or overheating\n- if you have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you have a \n\npossible prolactin-dependent tumour\n- if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been \n\nassociated with formation of blood clots.\n\nIf you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose \nor monitor you for a while.\n\nAs dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your \nblood has been seen very rarely with patients taking this medicine, your doctor may check your white \nblood cell counts.\n\nEven if you have previously tolerated oral paliperidone or risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur \nafter receiving injections of Xeplion. Seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, \nswelling of your throat, itching, or problems breathing as these may be signs of a serious allergic \nreaction.\n\nThis medicine may cause you to gain weight. Significant weight gain may adversely affect your \nhealth. Your doctor should regularly measure your body weight.\n\nAs diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with patients taking \nthis medicine, your doctor should check for signs of high blood sugar. In patients with pre-existing \ndiabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored regularly.\n\nSince this medicine may reduce your urge to vomit, there is a chance that it may mask the body’s \nnormal response to ingestion of toxic substances or other medical conditions.\nDuring an operation on the eye for cloudiness of the lens (cataract), the pupil (the black circle in the \nmiddle of your eye) may not increase in size as needed. Also, the iris (the coloured part of the eye) \nmay become floppy during surgery and that may lead to eye damage. If you are planning to have an \noperation on your eye, make sure you tell your eye doctor that you are taking this medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not for people who are under 18 years old.\n\n\n\n70\n\nOther medicines and Xeplion\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nTaking this medicine with carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic and mood stabiliser) may require a change \nto your dose of this medicine.\n\nSince this medicine works primarily in the brain, interference from other medicines that work in the \nbrain can cause an exaggeration of side effects such as sleepiness or other effects on the brain such as \nother psychiatric medications, opioids, antihistamines and sleep medication.\n\nSince this medicine can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when this medicine is used with \nother medicines that lower blood pressure.\n\nThis medicine can reduce the effect of medicines against Parkinson’s disease and restless legs \nsyndrome (e.g., levodopa).\n\nThis medicine may cause an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality demonstrating a long time for an \nelectrical impulse to travel through a certain part of the heart (known as “QT prolongation”). Other \nmedicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat the rhythm of the heart or to treat \ninfection, and other antipsychotics.\n\nIf you are prone to develop convulsions, this medicine may increase your chance of experiencing \nthem. Other medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat depression or to treat \ninfection, and other antipsychotics.\n\nXeplion should be used with caution with medicines that increase the activity of the central nervous \nsystem (psychostimulants such as methylphenidate).\n\nXeplion with alcohol\nAlcohol should be avoided.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

The following symptoms may occur \nin newborn babies of mothers that have used paliperidone in the last trimester (last three months of \ntheir pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, \nand difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms you may need to contact your \ndoctor.\n\nThis medicine can pass from mother to baby through breast milk and may harm the baby. Therefore, \nyou should not breastfeed when using this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDizziness, extreme tiredness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see \nsection 4). This should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g., when driving a car \nor handling machines.\n\nXeplion contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n\n\n71\n\n3.

Thereafter, you will receive an injection (ranging from\n25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or buttocks once a month.\n\nIf your doctor is switching you from risperidone long acting injection to this medicine, you will \nreceive the first injection of this medicine (ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or \nbuttocks on the date that your next injection was scheduled. Thereafter, you will receive an injection \n(ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or buttocks once a month.\n\nDepending on your symptoms, your doctor may increase or decrease the amount of medicine you \nreceive by one dose level at the time of your scheduled monthly injection.\n\nPatients with kidney problems\nYour doctor may adjust your dose of this medicine based on your kidney function. If you have mild \nkidney problems your doctor may give you a lower dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney \nproblems this medicine should not be used.\n\nElderly\nYour doctor may reduce your dose of this medicine if your kidney function is reduced.\n\nIf you are given more Xeplion than needed\nThis medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is, therefore, unlikely that you will be \ngiven too much.\n\nPatients who have been given too much paliperidone may experience the following symptoms:\ndrowsiness or sedation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, an abnormal electrocardiogram (electrical \ntracing of the heart), or slow or abnormal movements of the face, body, arms or legs.\n\nIf you stop using Xeplion\nIf you stop receiving your injections, you will lose the effects of the medicine.

It should be inspected visually for foreign matter \nbefore administration. Do not use if the syringe is not visually free of foreign matter.\n\nThe pack contains a pre-filled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1½-inch 22 gauge needle [38.1 mm x \n0.72 mm] and a 1-inch 23 gauge needle [25.4 mm x 0.64 mm]) for intramuscular injection. Xeplion is \nalso available in a Treatment initiation pack which contains two pre-filled syringes (150 mg + 100 mg)\nand 2 additional safety needles.\n\n1. Shake the syringe vigorously for a minimum of 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous \nsuspension.\n\n2. Select the appropriate needle.\n\nThe first initiation dose of Xeplion (150 mg) is to be administered on Day 1 in the DELTOID \nmuscle using the needle for DELTOID injection. The second initiation dose of Xeplion\n(100 mg) is to also be administered in the DELTOID muscle one week later (Day 8) using the \nneedle for DELTOID injection.\n\n\n\n79\n\nIf the patient is being switched from risperidone long acting injection to Xeplion, the first \ninjection of Xeplion (ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) can be administered in either the \nDELTOID or GLUTEAL muscle using the appropriate needle for the injection site at the time \nof the next scheduled injection.\n\nThereafter, the monthly maintenance injections can be administered in either the DELTOID or \nGLUTEAL muscle using the appropriate needle for the injection site.\n\nFor DELTOID injection, if the patient weighs < 90 kg, use the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle \n(25.4 mm x 0.64 mm) (needle with blue coloured hub); if the patient weighs ≥ 90 kg, use the \n1½-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with grey coloured hub).\n\nFor GLUTEAL injection, use the 1½-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with \ngrey coloured hub).\n\n3. While holding the syringe upright, remove the rubber tip cap with a twisting motion.\n\n4. Peel the safety needle blister pouch half way open. Grasp the needle sheath using the plastic \npeel pouch. Attach the safety needle to the luer connection of the syringe with an easy \nclockwise twisting motion.\n\n5. Pull the needle sheath away from the needle with a straight pull. Do not twist the sheath as the \nneedle may be loosened from the syringe.\n\n\n\n80\n\n6. Bring the syringe with the attached needle in upright position to de-aerate. De-aerate the syringe \nby moving the plunger rod carefully forward.\n\n7. Inject the entire contents intramuscularly slowly, deep into the selected deltoid or gluteal muscle \nof the patient. Do not administer intravascularly or subcutaneously.\n\n8. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (8a, 8b) or a flat surface \n(8c) to activate the needle protection system. The system is fully activated when a ‘click’ is \nheard. Discard the syringe with needle appropriately.\n\n\n\n81\n\n8a\n\n8b\n\n8c\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
