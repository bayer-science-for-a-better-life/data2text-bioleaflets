PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection.\nBefore reconstitution, the powder is a light yellow compact crystalline cake and the solvent is a clear \ncolourless fluid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in \nindividuals from 12 months of age (see section 4.2).\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nFor use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated \nindividuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons \nlikely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 12 months of age or older:\nIndividuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date. A second dose may be \nadministered at least 4 weeks after the first dose in accordance with official recommendation. The \nsecond dose is intended for individuals who did not respond to the first dose for any reason.\n\nInfants between 9 and 12 months of age:\nImmunogenicity and safety data show that M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants between 9 \nand 12 months of age, in accordance with official recommendations or when an early protection is \nconsidered necessary (e.g., day-care, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high prevalence of \nmeasles). Such infants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age. An additional dose with a \nmeasles-containing vaccine should be considered according to official recommendations (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1).\n\nInfants below 9 months of age:\nNo data on the efficacy and safety of M-M-RVAXPRO for use in children below 9 months of age are \ncurrently available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).\n\nThe preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid \narea in older children, adolescents, and adults. \nThe vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder. \n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, and for \ninstructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nDO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHistory of hypersensitivity to any measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients, \nincluding neomycin (see sections 2, 4.4, and 6.1).\n\nPregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see section \n4.6).\n\nVaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5\u00b0C.\n\nActive untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced \nexacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been \nreported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis.\n\nBlood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the \nhaematopoietic and lymphatic systems.\n\nCurrent immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). M-M-RVAXPRO is not \ncontraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. for \nasthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nSevere humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined \nimmunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific \nCD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ <25% %; children between 12-\n35 months: CD4+ < 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4). \n\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence \nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.\n\nFamily history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the \npotential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in \ncase of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).\n\nAdults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis \nor anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early \nsigns of such reactions.\n\nSince live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons \nwith a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the \nmouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at \nan enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-to-benefit ratio \nshould be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.\n\nDue caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RVAXPRO to persons with individual or \nfamily history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the \ntemperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).\n\nInfants from 9 to 12 months of age vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during measles \noutbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of circulating \nantibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nThis vaccine contains 14.5 mg of sorbitol as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.\n\nThrombocytopenia\nThis vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. \nIndividuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following \nvaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of \nM-M-RVAXPRO (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses. \nSerologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed. \nThe potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such \ncases (see section 4.8).\n\nOther\nVaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits \noutweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, \nchronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).\n\nImmunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may \nnot respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire \nmeasles, mumps, or rubella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. These \npatients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, and rubella.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nVaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO may not result in protection in all vaccinees.\n\nTransmission\nExcretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in \nthe majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence \nto indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated \nindividuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical \npossibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to \ninfants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).\n\nThere are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders\u2019 Edmonston strain of measles virus \nor the Jeryl Lynn\u2122 strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.\n\nInterference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nImmune globulin\nImmune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nAdministration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO may interfere with the \nexpected immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or \nplasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.\n\nAdministration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune \nglobulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RVAXPRO unless \nconsidered to be essential.\n\nLaboratory tests\nIt has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines given individually \nmay result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to \nbe done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after \nvaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nUse with other vaccines\nCurrently no specific studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of M-M-RVAXPRO and \nother vaccines. However, since M-M-RVAXPRO has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity \nprofiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered.\n\nPublished clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations, \nincluding DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV \n(Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella). M-M-RVAXPRO \nshould be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration \nof other live virus vaccines.\n\nBased on clinical studies with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and with \nthe previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc., M-M-RVAXPRO can be given simultaneously (but at separate injection sites) with \nPrevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune \nresponses were unaffected and that the overall safety profiles of the administered vaccines were \nsimilar.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nPregnant women should not be vaccinated with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nStudies have not been conducted with M-M-RVAXPRO in pregnant women. It is not known whether \nM-M-RVAXPRO can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect \nreproduction capacity. \n\nHowever, foetal damage has not been documented when measles or mumps vaccines have been given \nto pregnant women. Although a theoretical risk cannot be excluded, no cases of congenital rubella \nsyndrome have been reported in more than 3500 susceptible women who were unknowingly in early \nstages of pregnancy when vaccinated with a rubella-containing vaccine. Therefore, inadvertent \nvaccination of unknowingly pregnant women with measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines \nshould not be a reason for termination of pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become \npregnant should be advised to delay.\n\nBreast-feeding\nStudies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella \nvaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with \nserological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. It is not known whether \nmeasles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised \nwhen M-M-RVAXPRO is administered to a breast-feeding woman.\n\nFertility\nM-M-RVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nM-M-RVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials, M-M-RVAXPRO was administered to 1965 children (see section 5.1), and the \ngeneral safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella \nvaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nIn a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RVAXPRO, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. \nThe general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable, although injection-site \nreactions were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%). \n\nAll adverse reactions were evaluated in 1940 children. Among these children, the vaccine-related \nadverse reactions, summarised in section b, were observed in individuals following vaccination with \nM-M-RVAXPRO (excluding isolated reports with frequency <0.2%).\n\nIn comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RVAXPRO is not associated with an increase \nin the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity \nreaction.\n\nAdditionally, other adverse reactions reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RVAXPRO and/or in \nclinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality \nor frequency are available and are summarised in section b. The frequency of these adverse events is \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nqualified as \"not known\" when it cannot be estimated based on the available data. These data were \nreported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of M-M-RVAXPRO were: fever (38.5\u00b0C or \nhigher); injection site reactions including pain, swelling and erythema.\n\nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\n[Very common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \u22641/100); Not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data)] \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency\nInfections and infestations\nNasopharyngitis, Upper respiratory tract infection or \nViral infection\n\nUncommon\n\nAseptic meningitis\u2020, Atypical measles, Epididymitis, \nOrchitis, Otitis media, Parotitis, Rhinitis, Subacute \nsclerosing panencephalitis\u2020\n\nNot known\n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders\nRegional lymphadenopathy, Thrombocytopenia Not known\nImmune system disorders\nAnaphylactoid reaction, Anaphylaxis and related \nphenomenon such as Angioneurotic oedema, Facial \noedema, and Peripheral oedema\n\nNot known\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCrying Uncommon\nIrritability Not known\nNervous system disorders\nAfebrile convulsions or seizures, Ataxia, Dizziness, \nEncephalitis\u2020, Encephalopathy\u2020, Febrile convulsion (in \nchildren), Guillain-Barre syndrome, Headache, \nMeasles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) (see \nsection 4.3), Ocular palsies, Optic neuritis, \nParaesthesia, Polyneuritis, Polyneuropathy, \nRetrobulbar neuritis, Syncope\n\nNot known\n\nEye disorders\nConjunctivitis, Retinitis Not known\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nNerve deafness Not known\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders\nRhinorrhoea Uncommon\nBronchial spasm, Cough, Pneumonia, Pneumonitis \n(see section 4.3), Sore throat\n\nNot known\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nDiarrhoea or Vomiting Uncommon\nNausea Not known\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash morbilliform or other Rash Common\nUrticaria Uncommon\nPanniculitis, Pruritus, Purpura, Skin induration, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome\n\nNot known\n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders\nArthritis\u2020 and/or Arthralgia\u2020 (usually transient and \nrarely chronic), Myalgia\n\nNot known\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nFever (38.5\u00b0C or higher), Injection site erythema, Very common\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nInjection site pain, and Injection site swelling\nInjection site bruising Common\nInjection site rash Uncommon\nBurning and/or Stinging of short duration at the \ninjection site, Malaise, Papillitis, Peripheral oedema, \nSwelling, Tenderness, Vesicles at the injection site, \nWheal and Flare at the injection site\n\nNot known\n\nVascular disorders\nVasculitis Not known\n\n\u2020 see section c\n\nc. Description of selected adverse reactions\nAseptic meningitis\nCases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. \nAlthough a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has \nbeen shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn\u2122 mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.\n\nEncephalitis and Encephalopathy\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence \nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated \nmumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.\n\nSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis\nThere is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in \nchildren who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles \nvaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or \npossibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted \nby the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles \nvaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.\n\nArthralgia and/or arthritis\nArthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of \ninfection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in \nadult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints \nare generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and \narthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more \nmarked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for \nyears. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in \nchildren and adult women. Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well \ntolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.\n\nChronic arthritis\nChronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent \nvirus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed \nchronic joint symptoms.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAdministration of a higher than recommended dose of M-M-RVAXPRO was reported rarely and the \nadverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of \nM-M-RVAXPRO.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52\n\nEvaluation of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy\nA comparative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO or the previous formulation \n(manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured \nby Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.\n\nClinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the \nprevious formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. \nis highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine \ninduced measles hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies \nin 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.\n\nEvaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose\nA clinical study was conducted with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being given 3 \nmonths apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. The safety \nprofile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.\n\nIn the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high \nseroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps and rubella post-dose 2, regardless of the age of \nthe vaccinee at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 98.1% when \nthe first dose was given at 11 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months \n(non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were \n94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at \n12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met). \n\nThe seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, and rubella for the Full Analysis Set are given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Seroprotection Rates to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 6 Weeks Post-Dose 1 and 6 Weeks \nPost-Dose 2 of the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine manufactured by \n\nMerck & Co., Inc. \u2013 Full Analysis Set \n\nValence \n(seropro\ntection \nlevel)\n\nTime \npoint\n\nDose 1 at 9 months / \nDose 2 at 12 months\n\nN = 527\n\nDose 1 at 11 months / \nDose 2 at 14 months\n\nN = 480\n\nDose 1 at 12 months / \nDose 2 at 15 months\n\nN = 466\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates \n\n[95% CI]\n\nMeasles \n(titre \u2265255 \nmIU/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n72.3% \n[68.2; 76.1]\n\n87.6% \n[84.2; 90.4]\n\n90.6% \n[87.6; 93.1]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n94.6% \n[92.3; 96.4]\n\n98.1% \n[96.4; 99.1]\n\n98.9% \n[97.5; 99.6]\n\nMumps \n(titre \u226510 \n\nELISA Ab \nunits/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n96.4% \n[94.4; 97.8]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n98.5% \n[96.9; 99.4]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n99.2% \n[98.0; 99.8]\n\n99.6% \n[98.5; 99.9]\n\n99.3% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nRubella\n(titre \u226510 \nIU/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n97.3% \n[95.5; 98.5]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n97.8% \n[96.0; 98.9]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n99.4% \n[98.3; 99.9]\n\n99.4% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\n99.6% \n[98.4; 99.9]\n\nThe post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps and rubella were comparable across all \nage categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the first dose at 9 \nmonths of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 12 months of age.\n\nA comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO either by intramuscular route or \nsubcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration \nroutes. \n\nThe efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella \nvaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double-blind controlled field \ntrials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine \ncomponents. These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.\n\nPost-exposure vaccination\nVaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine \ncan be administered within 72 hours after exposure. If, however, the vaccine is given a few days \nbefore exposure, substantial protection may be afforded. There is no conclusive evidence that \nvaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide \nprotection.\n\nEffectiveness\nMore than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003). Widespread use \nof a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has \nled to a >99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.\n\nNon-pregnant adolescent and adult females\nVaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live \nattenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and \n4.6). Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently \nacquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents infection of the foetus and \nconsequent congenital rubella injury.\n\nPreviously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant \nwomen should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RVAXPRO or a \nmonovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.\n\nIndividuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella\nM-M-RVAXPRO is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and \nrubella. Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RVAXPRO regardless \nof their immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical studies have not been conducted. \n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in \nindividuals from 12 months of age (see section 4.2).\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nFor use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated \nindividuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women and persons \nlikely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 12 months of age or older:\nIndividuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date. A second dose may be \nadministered at least 4 weeks after the first dose in accordance with official recommendation. The \nsecond dose is intended for individuals who did not respond to the first dose for any reason.\n\nInfants between 9 and 12 months of age:\nImmunogenicity and safety data show that M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants between 9 \nand 12 months of age, in accordance with official recommendations or when an early protection is \nconsidered necessary (e.g., day-care, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high prevalence of \nmeasles). Such infants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age. An additional dose with a \nmeasles-containing vaccine should be considered according to official recommendations (see sections \n4.4 and 5.1).\n\nInfants below 9 months of age:\nNo data on the efficacy and safety of M-M-RVAXPRO for use in children below 9 months of age are \ncurrently available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).\n\nThe preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid \narea in older children, adolescents, and adults. \nThe vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder. \n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, and for \ninstructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nDO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHistory of hypersensitivity to any measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients, \nincluding neomycin (see sections 2, 4.4, and 6.1).\n\nPregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see section \n4.6).\n\nVaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5\u00b0C.\n\nActive untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not\nexperienced exacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies\nhave been reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated\ntuberculosis.\n\nBlood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the \nhaematopoietic and lymphatic systems.\n\nCurrent immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids). M-M-RVAXPRO is not \ncontraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. for \nasthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nSevere humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined \nimmunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific \nCD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ <25% ; children between 12-35 \nmonths: CD4+ < 20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ < 15% (see section 4.4).\n\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence \nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.\n\nFamily history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the \npotential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in \ncase of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8). \n\nAdults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis \nor anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early \nsigns of such reactions.\n\nSince live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons \nwith a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the \nmouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at \nan enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-to-benefit ratio \nshould be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.\n\nDue caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RVAXPRO to persons with individual or \nfamily history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the \ntemperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).\n\nInfants from 9 to 12 months of age vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during measles \noutbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of circulating \nantibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nThis vaccine contains 14.5 mg of sorbitol as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.\n\nThrombocytopenia\nThis vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. \nIndividuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following \nvaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of \nM-M-RVAXPRO (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses. \nSerologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed. \nThe potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such \ncases (see section 4.8).\n\nOther\nVaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits \noutweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia, \nchronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).\n\nImmunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may \nnot respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire \nmeasles, mumps, or rubella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration. These \npatients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, and rubella.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nVaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO may not result in protection in all vaccinees.\n\nTransmission\nExcretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in \nthe majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence \nto indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated \nindividuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical \npossibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to \ninfants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).\n\nThere are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders\u2019 Edmonston strain of measles virus \nor the Jeryl Lynn\u2122 strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.\n\nInterference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nImmune globulin\nImmune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nAdministration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO may interfere with the \nexpected immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or \nplasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.\n\nAdministration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune \nglobulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RVAXPRO unless \nconsidered to be essential.\n\nLaboratory tests\nIt has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines given individually \nmay result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to \nbe done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after\nvaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nUse with other vaccines\nCurrently no specific studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of M-M-RVAXPRO and \nother vaccines. However, since M-M-RVAXPRO has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity \nprofiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered.\n\nPublished clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, \nmumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations, \nincluding DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV \n(Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella). M-M-RVAXPRO \nshould be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration \nof other live virus vaccines.\n\nBased on clinical studies with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and with \nthe previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by \nMerck & Co., Inc., M-M-RVAXPRO can be given simultaneously (but at separate injection sites) with \nPrevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune \nresponses were unaffected and that the overall safety profiles of the administered vaccines were \nsimilar.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nPregnant women should not be vaccinated with M-M-RVAXPRO.\nStudies have not been conducted with M-M-RVAXPRO in pregnant women. It is not known whether \nM-M-RVAXPRO can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect \nreproduction capacity. \n\nHowever, foetal damage has not been documented when measles or mumps vaccines have been given \nto pregnant women. Although a theoretical risk cannot be excluded, no cases of congenital rubella \nsyndrome have been reported in more than 3500 susceptible women who were unknowingly in early \nstages of pregnancy when vaccinated with a rubella-containing vaccine. Therefore, inadvertent \nvaccination of unknowingly pregnant women with measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines \nshould not be a reason for termination of pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become \npregnant should be advised to delay.\n\nBreast-feeding\nStudies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella \nvaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with \nserological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. It is not known whether \nmeasles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised \nwhen M-M-RVAXPRO is administered to a breast-feeding woman.\n\nFertility\nM-M-RVAXPRO has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nM-M-RVAXPRO is expected to have no or negligible influence on ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials, M-M-RVAXPRO was administered to 1965 children (see section 5.1), and the \ngeneral safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella \nvaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nIn a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RVAXPRO, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. \nThe general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable, although injection-site \nreactions were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%). \n\nAll adverse reactions were evaluated in 1940 children. Among these children, the vaccine-related \nadverse reactions, summarised in section b, were observed in individuals following vaccination with \nM-M-RVAXPRO (excluding isolated reports with frequency <0.2%).\n\nIn comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RVAXPRO is not associated with an increase \nin the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity \nreaction.\n\nAdditionally, other adverse reactions reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RVAXPRO and/or in \nclinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality \nor frequency are available and are summarised in section b. The frequency of these adverse events is \n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nqualified as \"not known\" when it cannot be estimated based on the available data. These data were \nreported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of M-M-RVAXPRO were: fever (38.5\u00b0C or \nhigher); injection site reactions including pain, swelling and erythema.\n\nb.

Description of selected adverse reactions\nAseptic meningitis\nCases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. \nAlthough a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has \nbeen shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn\u2122 mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.\n\nEncephalitis and Encephalopathy\nIn severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing \nvaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence\nof disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated \nmumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.\n\nSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis\nThere is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in \nchildren who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles \nvaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or \npossibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted \nby the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles \nvaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.\n\nArthralgia and/or arthritis\nArthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of \ninfection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in \nadult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints \nare generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and \narthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more \nmarked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for \nyears. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in \nchildren and adult women. Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well \ntolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.\n\nChronic arthritis\nChronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent \nvirus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed \nchronic joint symptoms.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAdministration of a higher than recommended dose of M-M-RVAXPRO was reported rarely and the \nadverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of \nM-M-RVAXPRO.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52\n\nEvaluation of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy\nA comparative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO or the previous formulation \n(manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured \nby Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.\n\nClinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the \nprevious formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. \nis highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine \ninduced measles hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies \nin 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.\n\nEvaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose\nA clinical study was conducted with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being given 3 \nmonths apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose. The safety \nprofile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.\n\nIn the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high\nseroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps and rubella post-dose 2, regardless of the age of \nthe vaccinee at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were 98.1% when \nthe first dose was given at 11 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months \n(non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were \n94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at \n12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met). \n\nThe seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, and rubella for the Full Analysis Set are given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Seroprotection Rates to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 6 Weeks Post-Dose 1 and 6 Weeks \nPost-Dose 2 of the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine manufactured by \n\nMerck & Co., Inc. \u2013 Full Analysis Set \n\nValence \n(seropro\ntection \nlevel)\n\nTime \npoint\n\nDose 1 at 9 months / \nDose 2 at 12 months\n\nN = 527\n\nDose 1 at 11 months / \nDose 2 at 14 months\n\nN = 480\n\nDose 1 at 12 months / \nDose 2 at 15 months\n\nN = 466\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\nSeroprotection rates\n\n[95% CI]\n\nMeasles \n(titre \u2265255 \nmIU/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n72.3% \n[68.2; 76.1]\n\n87.6% \n[84.2; 90.4]\n\n90.6% \n[87.6; 93.1]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n94.6% \n[92.3; 96.4]\n\n98.1% \n[96.4; 99.1]\n\n98.9% \n[97.5; 99.6]\n\nMumps \n(titre \u226510 \n\nELISA Ab \nunits/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n96.4% \n[94.4; 97.8]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n98.5% \n[96.9; 99.4]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n99.2% \n[98.0; 99.8]\n\n99.6% \n[98.5; 99.9]\n\n99.3% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nRubella\n(titre \u226510 \nIU/mL)\n\nPost-\nDose 1\n\n97.3% \n[95.5; 98.5]\n\n98.7% \n[97.3; 99.5]\n\n97.8% \n[96.0; 98.9]\n\nPost-\nDose 2\n\n99.4% \n[98.3; 99.9]\n\n99.4% \n[98.1; 99.9]\n\n99.6% \n[98.4; 99.9]\n\nThe post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps and rubella were comparable across all \nage categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the first dose at 9 \nmonths of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 12 months of age.\n\nA comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO either by intramuscular route or \nsubcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration \nroutes. \n\nThe efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella \nvaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double-blind controlled field \ntrials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine \ncomponents. These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.\n\nPost-exposure vaccination\nVaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine \ncan be administered within 72 hours after exposure. If, however, the vaccine is given a few days \nbefore exposure, substantial protection may be afforded. There is no conclusive evidence that \nvaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide \nprotection.\n\nEffectiveness\nMore than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nmanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003). Widespread use \nof a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has \nled to a >99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.\n\nNon-pregnant adolescent and adult females\nVaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live \nattenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and \n4.6). Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently \nacquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents infection of the foetus and \nconsequent congenital rubella injury.\n\nPreviously unvaccinated individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant \nwomen should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RVAXPRO or a \nmonovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.\n\nIndividuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella\nM-M-RVAXPRO is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and \nrubella. Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RVAXPRO regardless \nof their immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical studies have not been conducted. \n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nPowder\nSorbitol\nSodium phosphate\nPotassium phosphate\nSucrose\nHydrolysed gelatin\nMedium 199 with Hanks\u2019 salts\nMinimum Essential Medium, Eagle (MEM)\nMonosodium L-glutamate\nNeomycin\nPhenol red\nSodium bicarbonate\nHydrochloric acid (to adjust pH)\nSodium hydroxide (to adjust pH)\n\nSolvent\nWater for injections\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, the vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n2 years.\n\nAfter reconstitution, the vaccine should be used immediately; however, in-use stability has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when refrigerated at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore and transport refrigerated (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial of powder in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6. 3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\nPowder in a vial (glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) and solvent in a pre-filled syringe (glass) with \nattached needle with plunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and needle-shield (natural rubber) in a pack \nsize of 1 and 10.\n\nPowder in a vial (glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) and solvent in a pre-filled syringe (glass) with \nplunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and tip cap (styrene-butadiene rubber), without needle, in pack \nsize 1, 10, and 20.\n\nPowder in a vial (glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber) and solvent in a pre-filled syringe (glass) with \nplunger stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and tip cap (styrene-butadiene rubber), with one or two \nunattached needles, in pack size 1, 10 and 20.\n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nTo reconstitute, use the solvent supplied. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. Before mixing with \nthe solvent, the powder is a light yellow compact crystalline cake. When completely reconstituted, the \nvaccine is a clear yellow liquid.\n\nIt is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of \ninfectious agents from one individual to another.\n\nReconstitution instructions\nInject the entire content of the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to mix \nthoroughly. \nThe reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of the \nsolvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.\n\nWithdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine vial into the same syringe and inject the entire \nvolume.\n\nIf two needles are provided: use one needle to reconstitute the vaccine and the other for its \nadministration to the person to be vaccinated.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n7.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist.\n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor of pharmacist. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What M-M-RVAXPRO is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RVAXPRO\n3. How to use M-M-RVAXPRO\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store M-M-RVAXPRO\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What M-M-RVAXPRO is and what it is used for\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, and rubella viruses that have been \nweakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will \nmake antibodies against the measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against \ninfections caused by these viruses.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps, and rubella. The \nvaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.\nM-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special \ncircumstances. \n\nM-M-RVAXPRO can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use\nin previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant \nwomen, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.\n\nAlthough M-M-RVAXPRO contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or \nrubella in healthy people.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive M-M-RVAXPRO\n\nDo not use M-M-RVAXPRO:\n- If you or your child are allergic to any of the components of this vaccine (including neomycin or \n\nany of the other ingredients listed in section 6)\n- If you or your child are pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after \n\nvaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding)\n- If you or your child have any illness with fever higher than 38.5\u00b0C; however, low-grade fever \n\nitself is not a reason to delay vaccination\n- If you or your child have active untreated tuberculosis\n- If you or your child have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune system\n- If you or your child are receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the immune \n\nsystem (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)\n- If you or your child have a weakened immune system because of a disease (including AIDS)\n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\n- If you or your child have a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless \nthe immune competence of you or your child is demonstrated.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to the doctor or pharmacist before you or your child receive M-M-RVAXPRO if you have \nexperienced any of the following:\n- If you or your child have an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg\n- If you or your child have a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)\n- If you or your child have a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine \n\n(in a single component vaccine or a combined vaccine, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella \nvaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or M-M-RVAXPRO) that involved easy bruising \nor bleeding for longer than usual\n\n- If you or your child have infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show \nsymptoms of HIV disease. You or your child should be monitored closely for measles, mumps, \nand rubella because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section \nDo not use M-M-RVAXPRO).\n\nAs with other vaccines, M-M-RVAXPRO may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. \nAlso, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella \nvirus but is not yet ill, M-M-RVAXPRO may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case \nof measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RVAXPRO may not always be able to \nprevent measles developing in these cases.\n\nOther medicines and M-M-RVAXPRO\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have recently taken any other \nmedicines (or other vaccines).\n\nThe doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or \nimmune globulin (known as IG). After vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO, IG should not be given for \n1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.\n\nIf a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or \n4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO may be given with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at a \nseparate injection site (e.g. the other arm or leg).\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at \nthe same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RVAXPRO should be given \n1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nM-M-RVAXPRO should not be given to pregnant females. Females of child-bearing age should take \nthe necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor\u2019s recommendation, \nafter they have been given the vaccine.\n\nPersons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if \nM-M-RVAXPRO should be given.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nDriving and using machines\nThere is no information to suggest that M-M-RVAXPRO affects the ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO contains sorbitol.\n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you or your child have an intolerance to some sugars, inform \nyour doctor before you or your child receive this vaccine.\n\n3. How to use M-M-RVAXPRO\n\nM-M-RVAXPRO should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer \nthigh or of the upper arm. Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young \nchildren whereas for older individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site. M-M-\nRVAXPRO is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. \n\nM-M-RVAXPRO is given as follows:\nOne dose is given at an elected date usually from 12 months of age.  Under special circumstances, it \ncan be given from 9 months of age. Further doses should be administered according to your doctor\u2019s \nrecommendation. The interval between 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks.\n\nReconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at the end of \nthe package leaflet.\n\n4.

previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella. although m-m-rvaxpro contains live

neomycin or any of the other ingredients listed in section 6) - if you or your child are pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination, see pregnancy and breast-feeding) - if you or your child have any illness with fever higher than 38.5; however, low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination - if you or your child have active untreated tuberculosis - if you or your child have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune system - if you or your child are receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy) - if you or your child have a weakened immune system because of a disease (including aids) 50 - if you or your child have a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of you or your child is demonstrated. warnings and precautions talk to the doctor or pharmacist before you or your child receive m-m-rvaxpro if you have experienced any of the following: - if you or your child have an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg - if you or your child have a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits) - if you or your child have a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine (in a single component vaccine or a combined vaccine, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by merck & co., inc., or m-m-rvaxpro) that involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual - if you or your child have infection with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) but do not show symptoms of hiv disease. you or your child should be monitored closely for measles, mumps, and rubella because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section do not use m-m-rvaxpro). as with other vaccines, m-m-rvaxpro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella virus but is not yet ill, m-m-rvaxpro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing. m-m-rvaxpro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of measles and may be incubating the disease. however, m-m-rvaxpro may not always be able to prevent measles developing in these cases. other medicines and m-m-rvaxpro tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have recently taken any other medicines (or other vaccines). the doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or immune globulin (known as ig). after vaccination with m-m-rvaxpro, ig should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. if a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with m-m-rvaxpro. m-m-rvaxpro may be given with prevenar and/or hepatitis a vaccine at the same visit at a separate injection site (e.g. the other arm or leg). m-m-rvaxpro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the same time. for vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, m-m-rvaxpro should be given 1 month before or after administration of those vaccines. pregnancy and breast-feeding m-m-rvaxpro should not be given to pregnant females. females of child-bearing age should take the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor's recommendation, after they have been given the vaccine. persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. the doctor will decide if m-m-rvaxpro should be given.
