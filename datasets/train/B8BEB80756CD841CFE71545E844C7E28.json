QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial delivers 2 mg of somatropin* (corresponding to 6 IU). \n \nAfter reconstitution, 0.2 mL of suspension contains 2 mg somatropin (10 mg/mL). \n \n*produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection. \n \nWhite or almost white powder. The solvent is a clear, oily liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is indicated for the replacement therapy of endogenous growth hormone in \nadults with childhood- or adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (GHD). \n \nAdult-onset: Patients with GHD in adulthood are defined as patients with known \nhypothalamic-pituitary pathology and at least one additional known deficiency of a pituitary hormone \nexcluding prolactin. These patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or \nexclude a GHD. \nChildhood-onset: In patients with childhood-onset isolated GHD (no evidence of \nhypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests should be performed after \ncompletion of growth, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations \n(< -2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test. The cut-off point of the \ndynamic test should be strict. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDiagnosis and therapy with this medicinal product should be initiated and monitored by physicians \nadequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with GHD. \n \nPosology \n \nSomatropin Biopartners should be administered subcutaneously at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nStarting dose \nGenerally, 2 mg once a week for all patients apart from female patients receiving oral oestrogen \ntherapy who should receive 3 mg once a week. In older or overweight patients, lower doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nGender Starting dose \nMale 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (not on oral oestrogen) 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (on oral oestrogen) 3 mg (9 IU) \n\n \nDose adjustment \nInitially, patients should have their IGF-I levels assessed at 3- to 4-weekly intervals until IGF-I SDS is \nin the target range of -0.5 to +1.5. Samples should be drawn 4 days after the previous dose (Day 4). \nRepeated adjustments in dose may be required, dependent on patients\u2019 IGF-I response. IGF-I levels \nshould be acted upon, as indicated below. \n \n\nIGF-I SDS Action on previous dose Dose change at a time \n\nIGF-I SDS lower than -1  Increase +1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)+1.0 mg (all other patients) \nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nless than 1SDS increase from Baseline  Increase \n\n+1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)\n+1.0 mg (all other patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nmore than 1 SDS increase from Baseline Maintain None \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of +1 to +2 \n\nMaintain or \ndecrease \ndepending on \nclinical status \n\nNone or -0.5 mg (all patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS greater than +2 Decrease -0.5 mg (all patients) \n \nIGF-I = insulin-like growth factor-I, SDS = standard deviation score. \n \nConversion from required dose to injection volume and vial strength \n \n\nSomatropin dose \n(mg) \n\nvials and solvent required for preparation of \none dose* \n\nInjection volume \n(mL) \n\n1 one 2-mg vial reconstituted \n with 0.4 mL solvent \n\n0.1 \n1.5 0.15 \n2 0.2 \n\n* Each vial contains an overfill of somatropin powder to allow the withdrawal of the required amount \nof somatropin when reconstituted (see section 6.6). \n \nFor other doses vials with 4 or 7 mg somatropin are available. \n \nThe minimum effective dose should be used. The treatment goal should be IGF-I concentrations \nwithin -0.5 and +1.5 SDS of the age corrected mean. \n \nIn order to reach the defined treatment goal, men may need lower growth hormone doses than women. \nOral oestrogen administration increases the dose requirements in women. An increasing sensitivity to \ngrowth hormone (expressed as change in IGF-I per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, \nparticularly in men. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every \n6 months. \n \nThe dosage of somatropin should be decreased in cases of persistent oedema or severe paraesthesia, in \norder to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe dose may be reduced in steps of 0.5 mg at a time. If the symptoms leading to the dose reduction \ndisappear, at the judgment of the physician, the dose may be maintained at the decreased level or \nincreased according to the dose adjustment scheme described above. If the symptom reappears after \nthe dose increase, then the dose should be maintained at the previous lower dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder people \nExperience with somatropin treatment in patients above 60 years of age is limited. Dose requirements \nmay decline with increasing age. \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nNo information in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is available and particular dose \nrecommendations cannot be given. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Somatropin Biopartners 2 mg in the paediatric population in the indication \nof long-term treatment of growth failure due to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone. \nFor the treatment of children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years the 10 mg and 20 mg vials of this \nmedicinal product should be used. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe patient or carer should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration procedure \nbefore being allowed to (self-) inject. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is administered subcutaneously once a week. After reconstitution the injection \nshould be administered immediately. \n \nThe subcutaneous injection should always be administered at the same time of the day to increase \ncompliance and the site of injection must be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity. Intracranial \n\ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to the initiation of \ngrowth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour \n(re)growth. \n\n\uf0b7 Somatropin treatment must not be started in patients with acute critical illness due to \ncomplications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or to \npatients having acute respiratory failure or similar conditions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies \n \nPatients with prior malignancies should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence. \n \nBenign intracranial hypertension \n \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision-making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \n \nBecause human growth hormone (hGH) may induce a state of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, \npatients treated with this medicinal product should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \nIn patients with an already manifest diabetes mellitus, the anti-diabetic therapy might require \nadjustment when somatropin treatment is initiated. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or \nadditional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. \n \nThyroid function \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Hypothyroidism may develop in patients \nwith central subclinical hypothyroidism after initiating therapy with growth hormone. Inadequate \ntreatment of hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to somatropin. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism receiving thyroxin replacement therapy, hyperpituitarism may \ndevelop. Thyroid function should therefore be closely monitored in all patients. \n \nAdrenal function \n \nTreatment with growth hormone may facilitate the development of adrenal insufficiency and \npotentially fatal adrenal crises in patients with organic GHD or idiopathic panhypopituitarism. It is \ntherefore crucial to assess baseline and stress doses of glucocorticoids which may need to be adjusted \nwhen growth hormone therapy is initiated. \n \nAdults with childhood-onset of GHD \n \nYoung adult patients with closed epiphyses who have previously been treated as children for GHD \nshould be re-evaluated for GHD using the criteria for adult patients (see section 4.1) before \nreplacement therapy is commenced at the doses recommended for adults. \n \nOther precautions \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to \nPrader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports of sleep \napnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may occur. \n \nAntibodies \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to this medicinal product. Somatropin Biopartners has given \nrise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these \nantibodies has been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy can inhibit the actions of hGH. Patients receiving concomitant \nglucocorticoid therapy should have their dose carefully adjusted. \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and \nmay unmask central hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may therefore need to be \ninitiated or adjusted. \n \nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective. \nIn women taking oral oestrogens, a higher dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the \ntreatment goal, see section 4.2. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. Because hGH may induce a state of insulin resistance, an adjustment of the insulin dose \nmay be required. \n \nSomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. Very limited data on \nexposure to other somatropin preparations during early pregnancy did not indicate an adverse \npregnancy outcome. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \n5.3). \nDuring normal pregnancy, levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 weeks of \ngestation, being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks. In view of this, it \nis unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth \nhormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Somatropin Biopartners is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted with Somatropin Biopartners in breast-feeding women. It is \nunknown whether somatropin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk; however, \nabsorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely. Caution should be \nexercised when this medicinal product is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with other somatropin formulations have shown adverse effects but the available \nnonclinical data are considered insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the use in humans (see section \n5.3). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials included approximately 530 patients treated with Somatropin Biopartners. When \nadverse reactions occurred, they tended to be transient and severity was generally mild to moderate. \nThe safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners is generally consistent with the well known safety profile \nof daily growth hormone treatments. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were injection \nsite related reactions, peripheral oedema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypothyroidism \nand decreased free thyroxine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed under treatment with Somatropin Biopartners in a \n6-month controlled clinical study with 151 adult patients with GHD of adult- or childhood-onset and \nin a 6-month extension study. Additional reports based on published information for daily growth \nhormone treatments are listed with asterisks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \nInfections and infestations \nCommon: Herpes simplex \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm progression (1 case of neoplasm progression in a female patient with a history of \nneurofibromatosis and radiation treatment), acrochordon, craniopharyngioma \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: Decreased or increased white blood cell count, increased glycosylated haemoglobin, \ndecreased haemoglobin \n \nImmune system disorders \nCommon: Formation of antibodies against growth hormone \n \nEndocrine disorders \nCommon: Adrenal insufficiency, decreased free thyroxine, decreased free tri-iodothyronine, increased \nblood TSH, hypothyroidism* \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Mild hyperglycaemia* \nCommon: Impaired fasting glucose, hyperlipidaemia, increased blood insulin, increased blood \ncholesterol, decreased blood sodium, increased blood triglycerides, increased blood glucose, increased \nor decreased HDL, increased LDL \nNot known: Insulin resistance* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, carpal tunnel syndrome, dizziness, somnolence \nRare: Benign intracranial hypertension* \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, visual acuity reduced \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \n \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, heart rate abnormal/irregular \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Hypertension,increased blood pressure \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Epistaxis \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hyperbilirubinaemia, cholecystitis, liver test abnormal \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Swelling face, acne, allergic dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, urticaria, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Back pain, pain in extremities, arthralgia, shoulder pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, bone \npain, muscular weakness, sensation of heaviness, tendonitis, joint swelling, arthritis, musculosceletal \npain, myalgia* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Haematuria, increased blood uric acid, increased blood creatinine \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Nipple pain \nUncommon: Gynaecomastia* \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Oedema peripheral, oedema (local and generalised)* \nCommon: Fatigue, pain, asthenia, face oedema, local swelling, oedema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, \nincreased weight, injection site pain \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: Increased blood phosphorus, increased or decreased IGF \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmunogenicity \nSome patients may develop antibodies to rhGH. Somatropin Biopartners has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these antibodies \nhas been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n \nWith regard to antibodies against host cell proteins, low anti-S. cerevisiae protein antibody titres \nsimilar to levels in the normal untreated population were found in some patients treated with this \nmedicinal product. The generation of such antibodies with low binding activity is unlikely to be \nclinically relevant. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nMalignancies/tumours \nCases of malignant and benign tumour recurrences, de-novo and secondary tumours have been \nreported in temporal relationship with somatropin therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nWith the exception of injection site related reactions and the formation of antibodies to rhGH which \nwere reported more frequently in children than in adults the safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners \nis similar for children and adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Due to the \nprolonged-release characteristics of this medicinal product peak levels of growth hormone can be \nexpected approximately 15 hours after injection, see section 5.2. Long term over-dosing could result in \nsigns and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of hGH excess. \n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nagonists, ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nThe somatropin in this medicinal product is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has \n191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons. The amino acid sequence of the \nactive substance is identical to that of hGH of pituitary origin. The somatropin in this medicinal \nproduct is synthesised in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of hGH of pituitary origin. \n \nSomatropin promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. The most prominent effect of \nsomatropin in children is the stimulation of the growth plates of long bones. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in patients with -GHD, in that body \nfat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSafety and efficacy in adults with GHD was assessed in a phase III, double-blind, randomized, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study. This pivotal phase III study comprised 151 adult \npatients with GHD of adult- or childhood-onset and lasted 6 months. After 6 months of weekly \ntreatment with Somatropin Biopartners, there was a statistically significant reduction of 1.6 kg in fat \nmass in the Somatropin Biopartners group compared to the placebo group. A similar improvement was \nobserved for the secondary efficacy endpoints namely increase in lean body mass, serum IGF-I and \nIGF-I SDS. Effects were maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing repeated weekly subcutaneous administration of a mean dose of 4.4 mg prolonged release \nsomatropin to adults with GHD the Cmax and tmax of plasma hGH were about 4.5 ng/mL and 15 h \nrespectively. The apparent terminal half-life was about 16.8 h in adults, presumably reflecting slow \nabsorption from the site of injection. \nThe tmax was later and the half-life longer following the administration of Somatropin Biopartners than \nwhen immediate release products had been previously administered once daily to the same subjects \nreflecting the slower and more prolonged release of hGH from the site of injection of Somatropin \nBiopartners. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo accumulation of hGH following multiple dosing of this medicinal product has been observed. \n \nBiotransformation / Elimination \n \nThe metabolic fate of hGH involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidney. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in dogs and juvenile monkeys showed \nthat Somatropin Biopartners released recombinant hGH in a prolonged manner and increased serum \nIGF-I for an extended period up to 5-6 days. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nAnimal studies with this medicinal product are not sufficient to fully assess the reproductive toxicity \npotential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin products there is no \nevidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions to the embryo or foetus. Doses in excess of human \ntherapeutic doses have shown adverse effects on reproductive function in male and female rats and \nmale dogs, possibly through disruption of hormonal regulation. In rabbits and monkeys no adverse \neffects were observed. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies with Somatropin Biopartners have not been conducted. There are no \nspecific studies which address local tolerance in animals after subcutaneous injection, but data \navailable from the repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed swelling and inflammatory infiltrate at the \ninjection sites. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.

The solvent vial should be warmed to room temperature and the powder vial \nshould be tapped and shaken to ensure the powder is moving freely. After removal of the protective \ncaps from the top of both vials the rubber stoppers should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 1 mL \ngraduated syringe with 19 Gauge or wider needle should be used for withdrawing the solvent from its \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nvial. The syringe should be filled with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the solvent for \ninjection and the air injected into the solvent vial to make it easier to withdraw the solvent. The vial \nshould be turned upside down, with the syringe in and the tip of the needle should be placed in the \nsolvent. To remove any bubbles, the syringe should be tapped gently. The plunger should be pushed \nup gently, until all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. The syringe should be filled with \nthe correct volume of the solvent for injection as listed above and the syringe needle withdrawn from \nthe vial subsequently. Any remaining solvent should not be used for a second preparation. \n \nHolding the needle against the inside vial wall, the entire contents of the syringe should be injected \ninto the powder vial. Without touching the rubber top the vial should be swirled vigorously until the \ncontent is completely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to \n90 seconds. The swirling should only be stopped once the suspension appears uniform, white and all \nthe powder on the bottom is dispersed. After reconstitution the medicinal product should be used \nimmediately before the suspension settles. If not used immediately, the suspension must be \nreconstituted again by swirling immediately before injection. The appropriate volume should be \nwithdrawn in a sterile syringe via a sterile 26-gauge needle: The vial should be turned upside down, \nwith the syringe in, and the tip of the needle should be placed in the suspension which is then slowly \nwithdrawn. To remove small air bubbles the syringe should be tapped gently. The powder should be \nhomogenously suspended in the injection vehicle prior to administration. The syringe should be held \nupright and gentle pressure applied to the plunger until a small drop of suspension appears at the end \nof the needle. The injection site should be cleaned with an alcohol swab and the suspension injected \nover a period of 5 seconds. \n \nDetailed information on how to administer this medicinal product is provided in section 3 of the \npatient leaflet. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is indicated for the replacement therapy of endogenous growth hormone in \nadults with childhood- or adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (GHD). \n \nAdult-onset: Patients with GHD in adulthood are defined as patients with known \nhypothalamic-pituitary pathology and at least one additional known deficiency of a pituitary hormone \nexcluding prolactin. These patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or \nexclude a GHD. \nChildhood-onset: In patients with childhood-onset isolated GHD (no evidence of \nhypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests should be performed after \ncompletion of growth, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations \n(< -2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test. The cut-off point of the \ndynamic test should be strict. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDiagnosis and therapy with this medicinal product should be initiated and monitored by physicians \nadequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with GHD. \n \nPosology \n \nSomatropin Biopartners should be administered subcutaneously at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nStarting dose \nGenerally, 2 mg once a week for all patients apart from female patients receiving oral oestrogen \ntherapy who should receive 3 mg once a week. In older or overweight patients, lower doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nGender Starting dose \nMale 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (not on oral oestrogen) 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (on oral oestrogen) 3 mg (9 IU) \n\n \nDose adjustment \nInitially, patients should have their IGF-I levels assessed at 3- to 4-weekly intervals until IGF-I SDS is \nin the target range of -0.5 to +1.5. Samples should be drawn 4 days after the previous dose (Day 4). \nRepeated adjustments in dose may be required, dependent on patients\u2019 IGF-I response. IGF-I levels \nshould be acted upon, as indicated below. \n \n\nIGF-I SDS Action on previous dose Dose change at a time \n\nIGF-I SDS lower than -1  Increase +1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)+1.0 mg (all other patients) \nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nless than 1SDS increase from Baseline  Increase \n\n+1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)\n+1.0 mg (all other patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nmore than 1 SDS increase from Baseline Maintain None \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of +1 to +2 \n\nMaintain or \ndecrease \ndepending on \nclinical status \n\nNone or -0.5 mg (all patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS greater than +2 Decrease -0.5 mg (all patients) \n \nIGF-I = insulin-like growth factor-I, SDS = standard deviation score. \n \nConversion from required dose to injection volume and vial strength \n \n\nSomatropin dose \n(mg) \n\nvials and solvent required for preparation of \none dose* \n\nInjection volume \n(mL) \n\n2.5 \none 4-mg vial reconstituted \n\n with 0.6 mL solvent \n\n0.25 \n3 0.3 \n\n3.5 0.35 \n4 0.4 \n\n* Each vial contains an overfill of somatropin powder to allow the withdrawal of the required amount \nof somatropin when reconstituted (see section 6.6). \n \nFor other doses vials with 2 or 7 mg somatropin are available. \n \nThe minimum effective dose should be used. The treatment goal should be IGF-I concentrations \nwithin -0.5 and +1.5 SDS of the age corrected mean. \n \nIn order to reach the defined treatment goal, men may need lower growth hormone doses than women. \nOral oestrogen administration increases the dose requirements in women. An increasing sensitivity to \ngrowth hormone (expressed as change in IGF-I per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, \nparticularly in men. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every \n6 months. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe dosage of somatropin should be decreased in cases of persistent oedema or severe paraesthesia, in \norder to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. \n \nThe dose may be reduced in steps of 0.5 mg at a time. If the symptoms leading to the dose reduction \ndisappear, at the judgment of the physician, the dose may be maintained at the decreased level or \nincreased according to the dose adjustment scheme described above. If the symptom reappears after \nthe dose increase, then the dose should be maintained at the previous lower dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder people \nExperience with somatropin treatment in patients above 60 years of age is limited. Dose requirements \nmay decline with increasing age. \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nNo information in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is available and particular dose \nrecommendations cannot be given. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Somatropin Biopartners 4 mg in the paediatric population in the indication \nof long-term treatment of growth failure due to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone. \nFor the treatment of children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years the 10 mg and 20 mg vials of this \nmedicinal product should be used. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe patient or carer should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration procedure \nbefore being allowed to (self-) inject. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is administered subcutaneously once a week. After reconstitution the injection \nshould be administered immediately. \n \nThe subcutaneous injection should always be administered at the same time of the day to increase \ncompliance and the site of injection must be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity. Intracranial \n\ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to the initiation of \ngrowth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour \n(re)growth. \n\n\uf0b7 Somatropin treatment must not be started in patients with acute critical illness due to \ncomplications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or to \npatients having acute respiratory failure or similar conditions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies \n \nPatients with prior malignancies should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence. \n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision-making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \n \nBecause human growth hormone (hGH) may induce a state of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, \npatients treated with this medicinal product should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \nIn patients with an already manifest diabetes mellitus, the anti-diabetic therapy might require \nadjustment when somatropin treatment is initiated. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or \nadditional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. \n \nThyroid function \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Hypothyroidism may develop in patients \nwith central subclinical hypothyroidism after initiating therapy with growth hormone. Inadequate \ntreatment of hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to somatropin. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism receiving thyroxin replacement therapy, hyperpituitarism may \ndevelop. Thyroid function should therefore be closely monitored in all patients. \n \nAdrenal function \n \nTreatment with growth hormone may facilitate the development of adrenal insufficiency and \npotentially fatal adrenal crises in patients with organic GHD or idiopathic panhypopituitarism. It is \ntherefore crucial to assess baseline and stress doses of glucocorticoids which may need to be adjusted \nwhen growth hormone therapy is initiated. \n \nAdults with childhood-onset of GHD \n \nYoung adult patients with closed epiphyses who have previously been treated as children for GHD \nshould be re-evaluated for GHD using the criteria for adult patients (see section 4.1) before \nreplacement therapy is commenced at the doses recommended for adults. \n \nOther precautions \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to \nPrader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports of sleep \napnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may occur. \n \nAntibodies \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to this medicinal product. Somatropin Biopartners has given \nrise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these \nantibodies has been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy can inhibit the actions of hGH. Patients receiving concomitant \nglucocorticoid therapy should have their dose carefully adjusted. \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and \nmay unmask central hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may therefore need to be \ninitiated or adjusted. \n \nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective. \nIn women taking oral oestrogens, a higher dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the \ntreatment goal, see section 4.2. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. Because hGH may induce a state of insulin resistance, an adjustment of the insulin dose \nmay be required. \n \nSomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. Very limited data on \nexposure to other somatropin preparations during early pregnancy did not indicate an adverse \npregnancy outcome. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \n5.3). \nDuring normal pregnancy, levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 weeks of \ngestation, being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks. In view of this, it \nis unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth \nhormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Somatropin Biopartners is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n M\n\ned\nici\n\nna\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted with Somatropin Biopartners in breast-feeding women. It is \nunknown whether somatropin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk; however, \nabsorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely. Caution should be \nexercised when this medicinal product is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with other somatropin formulations have shown adverse effects but the available \nnonclinical data are considered insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the use in humans (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials included approximately 530 patients treated with Somatropin Biopartners. When \nadverse reactions occurred, they tended to be transient and severity was generally mild to moderate. \nThe safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners is generally consistent with the well known safety profile \nof daily growth hormone treatments. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were injection \nsite related reactions, peripheral oedema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypothyroidism \nand decreased free thyroxine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed under treatment with Somatropin Biopartners in a \n6-month controlled clinical study with 151 adult patients with GHD of adult- or childhood-onset and \nin a 6-month extension study. Additional reports based on published information for daily growth \nhormone treatments are listed with asterisks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \nInfections and infestations \nCommon: Herpes simplex \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm progression (1 case of neoplasm progression in a female patient with a history of \nneurofibromatosis and radiation treatment), acrochordon, craniopharyngioma \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: Decreased or increased white blood cell count, increased glycosylated haemoglobin, \ndecreased haemoglobin \n \nImmune system disorders \nCommon: Formation of antibodies against growth hormone \n \nEndocrine disorders \nCommon: Adrenal insufficiency, decreased free thyroxine, decreased free tri-iodothyronine, increased \nblood TSH, hypothyroidism* \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nVery common: Mild hyperglycaemia* \nCommon: Impaired fasting glucose, hyperlipidaemia, increased blood insulin, increased blood \ncholesterol, decreased blood sodium, increased blood triglycerides, increased blood glucose, increased \nor decreased HDL, increased LDL \nNot known: Insulin resistance* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, carpal tunnel syndrome, dizziness, somnolence \nRare: Benign intracranial hypertension* \n \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, visual acuity reduced \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \n \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, heart rate abnormal/irregular \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Hypertension,increased blood pressure \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Epistaxis \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hyperbilirubinaemia, cholecystitis, liver test abnormal \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Swelling face, acne, allergic dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, urticaria, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Back pain, pain in extremities, arthralgia, shoulder pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, bone \npain, muscular weakness, sensation of heaviness, tendonitis, joint swelling, arthritis, musculosceletal \npain, myalgia* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Haematuria, increased blood uric acid, increased blood creatinine \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Nipple pain \nUncommon: Gynaecomastia* \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Oedema peripheral, oedema (local and generalised)* \nCommon: Fatigue, pain, asthenia, face oedema, local swelling, oedema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, \nincreased weight, injection site pain \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nInvestigations \nCommon: Increased blood phosphorus, increased or decreased IGF \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmunogenicity \nSome patients may develop antibodies to rhGH. Somatropin Biopartners has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these antibodies \nhas been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n \nWith regard to antibodies against host cell proteins, low anti-S. cerevisiae protein antibody titres \nsimilar to levels in the normal untreated population were found in some patients treated with this \nmedicinal product. The generation of such antibodies with low binding activity is unlikely to be \nclinically relevant. \n \nMalignancies/tumours \nCases of malignant and benign tumour recurrences, de-novo and secondary tumours have been \nreported in temporal relationship with somatropin therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nWith the exception of injection site related reactions and the formation of antibodies to rhGH which \nwere reported more frequently in children than in adults the safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners \nis similar for children and adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Due to the \nprolonged-release characteristics of this medicinal product peak levels of growth hormone can be \nexpected approximately 15 hours after injection, see section 5.2. Long term over-dosing could result in \nsigns and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of hGH excess. \n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nagonists, ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nThe somatropin in this medicinal product is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has \n191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons. The amino acid sequence of the \nactive substance is identical to that of hGH of pituitary origin. The somatropin in this medicinal \nproduct is synthesised in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of hGH of pituitary origin. \n \nSomatropin promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. The most prominent effect of \nsomatropin in children is the stimulation of the growth plates of long bones. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in patients with -GHD, in that body \nfat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSafety and efficacy in adults with GHD was assessed in a phase III, double-blind, randomized, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study. This pivotal phase III study comprised 151 adult \npatients with GHD of adult- or childhood-onset and lasted 6 months. After 6 months of weekly \ntreatment with Somatropin Biopartners, there was a statistically significant reduction of 1.6 kg in fat \nmass in the Somatropin Biopartners group compared to the placebo group. A similar improvement was \nobserved for the secondary efficacy endpoints namely increase in lean body mass, serum IGF-I and \nIGF-I SDS. Effects were maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing repeated weekly subcutaneous administration of a mean dose of 4.4 mg prolonged release \nsomatropin to adults with GHD the Cmax and tmax of plasma hGH were about 4.5 ng/mL and 15 h \nrespectively. The apparent terminal half-life was about 16.8 h in adults, presumably reflecting slow \nabsorption from the site of injection. \nThe tmax was later and the half-life longer following the administration of Somatropin Biopartners than \nwhen immediate release products had been previously administered once daily to the same subjects \nreflecting the slower and more prolonged release of hGH from the site of injection of Somatropin \nBiopartners. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo accumulation of hGH following multiple dosing of this medicinal product has been observed. \n \nBiotransformation / Elimination \n \nThe metabolic fate of hGH involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidney. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in dogs and juvenile monkeys showed \nthat Somatropin Biopartners released recombinant hGH in a prolonged manner and increased serum \nIGF-I for an extended period up to 5-6 days. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nAnimal studies with this medicinal product are not sufficient to fully assess the reproductive toxicity \npotential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin products there is no \nevidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions to the embryo or foetus. Doses in excess of human \ntherapeutic doses have shown adverse effects on reproductive function in male and female rats and \nmale dogs, possibly through disruption of hormonal regulation. In rabbits and monkeys no adverse \neffects were observed. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies with Somatropin Biopartners have not been conducted. There are no \nspecific studies which address local tolerance in animals after subcutaneous injection, but data \navailable from the repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed swelling and inflammatory infiltrate at the \ninjection sites. \n \n \n6.

The solvent vial should be warmed to room temperature and the powder vial \nshould be tapped and shaken to ensure the powder is moving freely. After removal of the protective \ncaps from the top of both vials the rubber stoppers should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 1 mL \ngraduated syringe with 19 Gauge or wider needle should be used for withdrawing the solvent from its \nvial. The syringe should be filled with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the solvent for \ninjection and the air injected into the solvent vial to make it easier to withdraw the solvent. The vial \nshould be turned upside down, with the syringe in and the tip of the needle should be placed in the \nsolvent. To remove any bubbles, the syringe should be tapped gently. The plunger should be pushed \nup gently, until all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. The syringe should be filled with \nthe correct volume of the solvent for injection as listed above and the syringe needle withdrawn from \nthe vial subsequently. Any remaining solvent should not be used for a second preparation. \n \nHolding the needle against the inside vial wall, the entire contents of the syringe should be injected \ninto the powder vial. Without touching the rubber top the vial should be swirled vigorously until the \ncontent is completely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to \n90 seconds. The swirling should only be stopped once the suspension appears uniform, white and all \nthe powder on the bottom is dispersed. After reconstitution the medicinal product should be used \nimmediately before the suspension settles. If not used immediately, the suspension must be \nreconstituted again by swirling immediately before injection. The appropriate volume should be \nwithdrawn in a sterile syringe via a sterile 26-gauge needle: The vial should be turned upside down, \nwith the syringe in, and the tip of the needle should be placed in the suspension which is then slowly \nwithdrawn. To remove small air bubbles the syringe should be tapped gently. The powder should be \nhomogenously suspended in the injection vehicle prior to administration. The syringe should be held \nupright and gentle pressure applied to the plunger until a small drop of suspension appears at the end \nof the needle. The injection site should be cleaned with an alcohol swab and the suspension injected \nover a period of 5 seconds. \n \nDetailed information on how to administer this medicinal product is provided in section 3 of the \npatient leaflet. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n7.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection. \n \nWhite or almost white powder. The solvent is a clear, oily liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is indicated for the replacement therapy of endogenous growth hormone in \nadults with childhood- or adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (GHD). \n \nAdult-onset: Patients with GHD in adulthood are defined as patients with known \nhypothalamic-pituitary pathology and at least one additional known deficiency of a pituitary hormone \nexcluding prolactin. These patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or \nexclude a GHD. \nChildhood-onset: In patients with childhood-onset isolated GHD (no evidence of \nhypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests should be performed after \ncompletion of growth, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations \n(< -2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test. The cut-off point of the \ndynamic test should be strict. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDiagnosis and therapy with this medicinal product should be initiated and monitored by physicians \nadequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with GHD. \n \nPosology \n \nSomatropin Biopartners should be administered subcutaneously at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nStarting dose \nGenerally, 2 mg once a week for all patients apart from female patients receiving oral oestrogen \ntherapy who should receive 3 mg once a week. In older or overweight patients, lower doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nGender Starting dose \nMale 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (not on oral oestrogen) 2 mg (6 IU) \nFemale (on oral oestrogen) 3 mg (9 IU) \n\n \nDose adjustment \nInitially, patients should have their IGF-I levels assessed at 3- to 4-weekly intervals until IGF-I SDS is \nin the target range of -0.5 to +1.5. Samples should be drawn 4 days after the previous dose (Day 4). \nRepeated adjustments in dose may be required, dependent on patients\u2019 IGF-I response. IGF-I levels \nshould be acted upon, as indicated below. \n \n\nIGF-I SDS Action on previous dose Dose change at a time \n\nIGF-I SDS lower than -1  Increase +1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)+1.0 mg (all other patients) \nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nless than 1SDS increase from Baseline  Increase \n\n+1.5 mg (female on oral oestrogen)\n+1.0 mg (all other patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of -1 to +1 and  \nmore than 1 SDS increase from Baseline Maintain None \n\nIGF-I SDS in the range of +1 to +2 \n\nMaintain or \ndecrease \ndepending on \nclinical status \n\nNone or -0.5 mg (all patients) \n\nIGF-I SDS greater than +2 Decrease -0.5 mg (all patients) \n \nIGF-I = insulin-like growth factor-I, SDS = standard deviation score. \n \nConversion from required dose to injection volume and vial strength \n \n\nSomatropin dose \n(mg) \n\nvials and solvent required for preparation of \none dose* \n\nInjection volume \n(mL) \n\n4.5 \n\none 7-mg vial reconstituted \n with 0.9 mL solvent \n\n0.45 \n5 0.5 \n\n5.5 0.55 \n6 0.6 \n\n6.5 0.65 \n7 0.7 \n\n* Each vial contains an overfill of somatropin powder to allow the withdrawal of the required amount \nof somatropin when reconstituted (see section 6.6). \n \nFor other doses vials with 2 or 4 mg somatropin are available. \n \nThe minimum effective dose should be used. The treatment goal should be IGF-I concentrations \nwithin -0.5 and +1.5 SDS of the age corrected mean. \n \nIn order to reach the defined treatment goal, men may need lower growth hormone doses than women. \nOral oestrogen administration increases the dose requirements in women. An increasing sensitivity to \ngrowth hormone (expressed as change in IGF-I per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, \nparticularly in men. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every \n6 months. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nThe dosage of somatropin should be decreased in cases of persistent oedema or severe paraesthesia, in \norder to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. \n \nThe dose may be reduced in steps of 0.5 mg at a time. If the symptoms leading to the dose reduction \ndisappear, at the judgment of the physician, the dose may be maintained at the decreased level or \nincreased according to the dose adjustment scheme described above. If the symptom reappears after \nthe dose increase, then the dose should be maintained at the previous lower dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder people \nExperience with somatropin treatment in patients above 60 years of age is limited. Dose requirements \nmay decline with increasing age. \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nNo information in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is available and particular dose \nrecommendations cannot be given. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Somatropin Biopartners 7 mg in the paediatric population in the indication \nof long-term treatment of growth failure due to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone. \nFor the treatment of children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years the 10 mg and 20 mg vials of this \nmedicinal product should be used. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe patient or carer should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration procedure \nbefore being allowed to (self-) inject. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is administered subcutaneously once a week. After reconstitution the injection \nshould be administered immediately. \n \nThe subcutaneous injection should always be administered at the same time of the day to increase \ncompliance and the site of injection must be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity. Intracranial \n\ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to the initiation of \ngrowth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour \n(re)growth. \n\n\uf0b7 Somatropin treatment must not be started in patients with acute critical illness due to \ncomplications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or to \npatients having acute respiratory failure or similar conditions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies \n \nPatients with prior malignancies should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence. \n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision-making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \n \nBecause human growth hormone (hGH) may induce a state of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, \npatients treated with this medicinal product should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \nIn patients with an already manifest diabetes mellitus, the anti-diabetic therapy might require \nadjustment when somatropin treatment is initiated. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or \nadditional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. \n \nThyroid function \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Hypothyroidism may develop in patients \nwith central subclinical hypothyroidism after initiating therapy with growth hormone. Inadequate \ntreatment of hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to somatropin. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism receiving thyroxin replacement therapy, hyperpituitarism may \ndevelop. Thyroid function should therefore be closely monitored in all patients. \n \nAdrenal function \n \nTreatment with growth hormone may facilitate the development of adrenal insufficiency and \npotentially fatal adrenal crises in patients with organic GHD or idiopathic panhypopituitarism. It is \ntherefore crucial to assess baseline and stress doses of glucocorticoids which may need to be adjusted \nwhen growth hormone therapy is initiated. \n \nAdults with childhood-onset of GHD \n \nYoung adult patients with closed epiphyses who have previously been treated as children for GHD \nshould be re-evaluated for GHD using the criteria for adult patients (see section 4.1) before \nreplacement therapy is commenced at the doses recommended for adults. \n \nOther precautions \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to \nPrader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports of sleep \napnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may occur. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\nAntibodies \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to this medicinal product. Somatropin Biopartners has given \nrise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these \nantibodies has been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy can inhibit the actions of hGH. Patients receiving concomitant \nglucocorticoid therapy should have their dose carefully adjusted. \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and \nmay unmask central hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may therefore need to be \ninitiated or adjusted. \n \nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective. \nIn women taking oral oestrogens, a higher dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the \ntreatment goal, see section 4.2. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. Because hGH may induce a state of insulin resistance, an adjustment of the insulin dose \nmay be required. \n \nSomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. Very limited data on \nexposure to other somatropin preparations during early pregnancy did not indicate an adverse \npregnancy outcome. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \n5.3). \nDuring normal pregnancy, levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 weeks of \ngestation, being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks. In view of this, it \nis unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth \nhormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Somatropin Biopartners is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted with Somatropin Biopartners in breast-feeding women. It is \nunknown whether somatropin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk; however, \nabsorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely. Caution should be \nexercised when this medicinal product is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with other somatropin formulations have shown adverse effects but the available \nnonclinical data are considered insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the use in humans (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials included approximately 530 patients treated with Somatropin Biopartners. When \nadverse reactions occurred, they tended to be transient and severity was generally mild to moderate. \nThe safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners is generally consistent with the well known safety profile \nof daily growth hormone treatments. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were injection \nsite related reactions, peripheral oedema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypothyroidism \nand decreased free thyroxine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed under treatment with Somatropin Biopartners in a \n6-month controlled clinical study with 151 adult patients with GHD of adult or childhood-onset and in \na 6-month extension study. Additional reports based on published information for daily growth \nhormone treatments are listed with asterisks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \nInfections and infestations \nCommon: Herpes simplex \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm progression (1 case of neoplasm progression in a female patient with a history of \nneurofibromatosis and radiation treatment), acrochordon, craniopharyngioma \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: Decreased or increased white blood cell count, increased glycosylated haemoglobin, \ndecreased haemoglobin \n \nImmune system disorders \nCommon: Formation of antibodies against growth hormone \n \nEndocrine disorders \nCommon: Adrenal insufficiency, decreased free thyroxine, decreased free tri-iodothyronine, increased \nblood TSH, hypothyroidism* \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Mild hyperglycaemia* \nCommon: Impaired fasting glucose, hyperlipidaemia, increased blood insulin, increased blood \ncholesterol, decreased blood sodium, increased blood triglycerides, increased blood glucose, increased \nor decreased HDL, increased LDL \nNot known: Insulin resistance* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, carpal tunnel syndrome, dizziness, somnolence \nRare: Benign intracranial hypertension* \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, visual acuity reduced \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \n \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, heart rate abnormal/irregular \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Hypertension,increased blood pressure \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Epistaxis \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hyperbilirubinaemia, cholecystitis, liver test abnormal \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Swelling face, acne, allergic dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, urticaria, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Back pain, pain in extremities, arthralgia, shoulder pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, bone \npain, muscular weakness, sensation of heaviness, tendonitis, joint swelling, arthritis, musculosceletal \npain, myalgia* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Haematuria, increased blood uric acid, increased blood creatinine \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Nipple pain \nUncommon: Gynaecomastia* \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Oedema peripheral, oedema (local and generalised)* \nCommon: Fatigue, pain, asthenia, face oedema, local swelling, oedema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, \nincreased weight, injection site pain \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nInvestigations \nCommon: Increased blood phosphorus, increased or decreased IGF \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmunogenicity \nSome patients may develop antibodies to rhGH. Somatropin Biopartners has given rise to the \nformation of antibodies in approximately 4% of adult patients. The binding activity of these antibodies \nhas been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their formation. \n \nWith regard to antibodies against host cell proteins, low anti-S. cerevisiae protein antibody titres \nsimilar to levels in the normal untreated population were found in some patients treated with this \nmedicinal product. The generation of such antibodies with low binding activity is unlikely to be \nclinically relevant. \n \nMalignancies/tumours \nCases of malignant and benign tumour recurrences, de-novo and secondary tumours have been \nreported in temporal relationship with somatropin therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nWith the exception of injection site related reactions and the formation of antibodies to rhGH which \nwere reported more frequently in children than in adults the safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners \nis similar for children and adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Due to the \nprolonged-release characteristics of this medicinal product peak levels of growth hormone can be \nexpected approximately 15 hours after injection, see section 5.2. Long term over-dosing could result in \nsigns and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of hGH excess. \n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nagonists, ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nThe somatropin in this medicinal product is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has \n191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons. The amino acid sequence of the \nactive substance is identical to that of hGH of pituitary origin. The somatropin in this medicinal \nproduct is synthesised in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of hGH of pituitary origin. \n \nSomatropin promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. The most prominent effect of \nsomatropin in children is the stimulation of the growth plates of long bones. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in patients with -GHD, in that body \nfat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nSafety and efficacy in adults with GHD was assessed in a phase III, double-blind, randomized, \nplacebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study. This pivotal phase III study comprised 151 adult \npatients with GHD of adult- or childhood-onset and lasted 6 months. After 6 months of weekly \ntreatment with Somatropin Biopartners, there was a statistically significant reduction of 1.6 kg in fat \nmass in the Somatropin Biopartners group compared to the placebo group. A similar improvement was \nobserved for the secondary efficacy endpoints namely increase in lean body mass, serum IGF-I and \nIGF-I SDS. Effects were maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing repeated weekly subcutaneous administration of a mean dose of 4.4 mg prolonged release \nsomatropin to adults with GHD the Cmax and tmax of plasma hGH were about 4.5 ng/mL and 15 h \nrespectively. The apparent terminal half-life was about 16.8 h in adults, presumably reflecting slow \nabsorption from the site of injection. \nThe tmax was later and the half-life longer following the administration of Somatropin Biopartners than \nwhen immediate release products had been previously administered once daily to the same subjects \nreflecting the slower and more prolonged release of hGH from the site of injection of Somatropin \nBiopartners. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo accumulation of hGH following multiple dosing of this medicinal product has been observed. \n \nBiotransformation / Elimination \n \nThe metabolic fate of hGH involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidney. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in dogs and juvenile monkeys showed \nthat Somatropin Biopartners released recombinant hGH in a prolonged manner and increased serum \nIGF-I for an extended period up to 5-6 days. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nAnimal studies with this medicinal product are not sufficient to fully assess the reproductive toxicity \npotential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin products there is no \nevidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions to the embryo or foetus. Doses in excess of human \ntherapeutic doses have shown adverse effects on reproductive function in male and female rats and \nmale dogs, possibly through disruption of hormonal regulation. In rabbits and monkeys no adverse \neffects were observed. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies with Somatropin Biopartners have not been conducted. There are no \nspecific studies which address local tolerance in animals after subcutaneous injection, but data \navailable from the repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed swelling and inflammatory infiltrate at the \ninjection sites. \n \n \n6.

The solvent vial should be warmed to room temperature and the powder vial \nshould be tapped and shaken to ensure the powder is moving freely. After removal of the protective \ncaps from the top of both vials the rubber stoppers should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 1 mL \ngraduated syringe with 19 Gauge or wider needle should be used for withdrawing the solvent from its \nvial. The syringe should be filled with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the solvent for \ninjection and the air injected into the solvent vial to make it easier to withdraw the solvent. The vial \nshould be turned upside down, with the syringe in and the tip of the needle should be placed in the \nsolvent. To remove any bubbles, the syringe should be tapped gently. The plunger should be pushed \nup gently, until all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. The syringe should be filled with \nthe correct volume of the solvent for injection as listed above and the syringe needle withdrawn from \nthe vial subsequently. Any remaining solvent should not be used for a second preparation. \n \nHolding the needle against the inside vial wall, the entire contents of the syringe should be injected \ninto the powder vial. Without touching the rubber top the vial should be swirled vigorously until the \ncontent is completely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to \n90 seconds. The swirling should only be stopped once the suspension appears uniform, white and all \nthe powder on the bottom is dispersed. After reconstitution the medicinal product should be used \nimmediately before the suspension settles. If not used immediately, the suspension must be \nreconstituted again by swirling immediately before injection. The appropriate volume should be \nwithdrawn in a sterile syringe via a sterile 26-gauge needle: The vial should be turned upside down, \nwith the syringe in, and the tip of the needle should be placed in the suspension which is then slowly \nwithdrawn. To remove small air bubbles the syringe should be tapped gently. The powder should be \nhomogenously suspended in the injection vehicle prior to administration. The syringe should be held \nupright and gentle pressure applied to the plunger until a small drop of suspension appears at the end \nof the needle. The injection site should be cleaned with an alcohol swab and the suspension injected \nover a period of 5 seconds. \n \nDetailed information on how to administer this medicinal product is provided in section 3 of the \npatient leaflet. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\n7.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection. \n \nWhite or almost white powder. The solvent is a clear, oily liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is indicated in children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years for long-term \ntreatment of growth failure due to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDiagnosis and therapy with this medicinal product should be initiated and monitored by physicians \nadequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth hormone deficiency \n(GHD). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended and maximum dose is 0.5 mg/kg/week and should not be exceeded. In children, \nSomatropin Biopartners should be administered subcutaneously at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. For \ndosage instruction, see table below. \n \nIt is recommended that a maximum injection volume of 1 mL per injection site, corresponding to a \ndose of 20 mg of somatropin, should not be exceeded. \n \nFor children heavier than 20 kg, Somatropin Biopartners 20 mg powder and solvent for \nprolonged-release suspension for injection is available. \nFor children heavier than 40 kg, two vials (a 10 mg and a 20 mg vial or two vials of 20 mg) can be \nused according to the body weight as indicated in the table below. The maximum injection volume per \ninjection site should not exceed 1 mL.

(see section 6.6). \n \nTreatment with this medicinal product should be continued until final height has been reached or until \nepiphyseal closure. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nWhere childhood-onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > - 1 (i.e. standardised to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account gender and ethnicity) is one of the \ntherapeutic objectives during the transition period. Once a normal peak bone mass is attained patients \nshould be switched to Somatropin Biopartners for adults, if clinically indicated, and the dosing \nrecommendation for adults should be followed. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nNo information in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is available and particular dose \nrecommendations cannot be given. \n \nPaediatric population (below 2 years of age) \nSomatropin Biopartners should not be used in infants below the age of 2 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe patient or carer should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration procedure \nbefore being allowed to (self-) inject. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is administered subcutaneously once a week. After reconstitution the injection \nshould be administered immediately. \n \nThe subcutaneous injection should always be administered at the same time of the day to increase \ncompliance and the site of injection must be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity. Intracranial \n\ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to the initiation of \ngrowth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour \n(re)growth. \n\n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin treatment must not be started in patients with acute critical illness due to \n\ncomplications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or to \npatients having acute respiratory failure or similar conditions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies \n \nPatients with prior malignancies should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence. \n \nIn paediatric patients there is no evidence that growth hormone replacement influences the recurrence \nrate or regrowth of intracranial neoplasms, but standard clinical practice requires regular pituitary \nimaging in patients with a history of pituitary pathology. A baseline scan is recommended in these \npatients before instituting growth hormone replacement therapy. \n \nThere is an increased risk that paediatric patients with prior malignancies may develop second \nneoplasm when treated with growth hormone, especially if treatment of the primary malignancy \ninvolved radiotherapy. These patients should be counselled on risks before initiating therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \n \nBecause human growth hormone (hGH) may induce a state of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, \npatients treated with this medicinal product should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \nIn patients with an already manifest diabetes mellitus, the anti-diabetic therapy might require \nadjustment when somatropin treatment is initiated. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or \nadditional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. \n \nThyroid function \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Hypothyroidism may develop in patients \nwith central subclinical hypothyroidism after initiating therapy with growth hormone. Inadequate \ntreatment of hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to somatropin. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism receiving thyroxin replacement therapy, hyperpituitarism may \ndevelop. Thyroid function should therefore be closely monitored in all patients. \n \nAdrenal function \n \nTreatment with growth hormone may facilitate the development of adrenal insufficiency and \npotentially fatal adrenal crises in patients with organic GHD or idiopathic panhypopituitarism. It is \ntherefore crucial to assess baseline and stress doses of glucocorticoids which may need to be adjusted \nwhen growth hormone therapy is initiated. \n \nOther precautions \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to \nPrader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports of sleep \napnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may occur. \n \nPaediatric patients with endocrine disorders, including GHD, may develop slipped capital femoral \nepiphyses more frequently. Any child with the onset of a limp during growth hormone therapy should \nbe evaluated. \n \nThe recommended weekly dose in children (i.e. 0.5 mg/kg/week) should not be exceeded as there is \nlimited experience with higher doses in this patient group. \n \nLeukaemia \n \nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of GHD patients, some of whom have been treated \nwith somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is increased in growth \nhormone recipients without predisposition factors. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nScoliosis \n \nProgression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin \nincreases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be \nmonitored for progression of scoliosis. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the incidence or \nseverity of scoliosis. \n \nAntibodies \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to this medicinal product. Somatropin Biopartners has given \nrise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 33% of the paediatric patients. The binding \nactivity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their \nformation. Testing for antibodies to somatropin may be considered in patients with otherwise \nunexplained lack of growth response. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site related reactions, mostly swelling at the injection site, were reported in approximately \n43% of the paediatric patients. Few patients discontinued treatment due to injections site reactions, see \nsection 4.8. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of hGH. Patients receiving \nconcomitant glucocorticoid therapy should have their dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory \neffect on growth. \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and \nmay unmask central hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may therefore need to be \ninitiated or adjusted. \n \nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. Because hGH may induce a state of insulin resistance, an adjustment of the insulin dose \nmay be required. \n \nSomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. Very limited data on \nexposure to other somatropin preparations during early pregnancy did not indicate an adverse \npregnancy outcome. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \n5.3). \nDuring normal pregnancy, levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 weeks of \ngestation, being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks. In view of this, it \nis unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth \nhormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Somatropin Biopartners is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted with Somatropin Biopartners in breast-feeding women. It is \nunknown whether somatropin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk; however, \nabsorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely. Caution should be \nexercised when this medicinal product is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with other somatropin formulations have shown adverse effects but the available \nnonclinical data are considered insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the use in humans (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials included approximately 530 patients treated with Somatropin Biopartners. When \nadverse reactions occurred, they tended to be transient and severity was generally mild to moderate. \nThe safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners is generally consistent with the well known safety profile \nof daily growth hormone treatments. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were injection \nsite related reactions, peripheral oedema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypothyroidism \nand decreased free thyroxine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed under treatment with Somatropin Biopartners in a \n12-month controlled comparative clinical study in 178 treatment na\u00efve children with growth failure \ndue to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone and in a dose finding study. Additional \nreports based on published information for daily growth hormone treatments are listed with asterisks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery common: Formation of antibodies against growth hormone (33%), see section \u201cDescriptions of \nselected adverse reactions\u201d, under \u201cImmunogenicity\u201d. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43 \n\nEndocrine disorders \nCommon: Hypercortisolism (7.7%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), adrenal cortical insufficiency (3.3%), \nhypothyreosis secondary to TSH deficiency (2.6%), decreased free thyroxine (4.4%), increased blood \nTSH (2.2%) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Mild hyperglycaemia* \nNot known: Insulin resistance* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery rare: insomnia* \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache (4.4%), lethargy (1.1%), dizziness (2.6%) \nRare: paraesthesia* \n \nVascular disorders \nRare: hypertension* \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: vomitting (1.1%), abdominal pain (1.1%) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: pigmentation disorder (1.1%) \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: arthralgia (1.1%), pain in extremities (5.1%) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery rare: gynaecomastia* \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling (30.8%) \nCommon: injection site pain (9.9%), injection site discolouration (8.8%), injection site erythema \n(7.7%), injection site nodule (4.4%), injection site reaction (1.1%), injection site warmth (1.1%), \npyrexia (2.6%), oedema (local and generalised)* \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: decreased blood cortisol (2.2%) \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions in children were injection site related reactions, most \nof them being mild to moderate in intensity. Few patients discontinued treatment due to injections site \nreactions. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the pivotal paediatric study, antibody responses to somatropin at two or more consecutive visits \nwere observed in 33% of the patients. No effect on safety or efficacy was observed. It is unlikely that \nthe antibody responses to treatment with Somatropin Biopartners are of clinical relevance. \n \nWith regard to antibodies against host cell proteins, low anti-S. cerevisiae protein antibody titres \nsimilar to levels in the normal untreated population were found in some patients treated with this \nmedicinal product. The generation of such antibodies with low binding activity is unlikely to be \nclinically relevant. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n44 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Due to the \nprolonged-release characteristics of this medicinal product peak levels of growth hormone can be \nexpected approximately 15 hours after injection, see section 5.2. Long term over-dosing could result in \nsigns and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of hGH excess. \n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nagonists, ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nThe somatropin in this medicinal product is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has \n191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons. The amino acid sequence of the \nactive substance is identical to that of hGH of pituitary origin. The somatropin in this medicinal \nproduct is synthesised in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of hGH of pituitary origin. \n \nThe most prominent effect of somatropin in children is the stimulation of the growth plates of long \nbones. Additionally, it promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in patients with -GHD, in that body \nfat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n45 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn a randomized, parallel-group, multicentre Phase III study, 178 children between 3 and 12 years of \nage with organic and/or idiopathic GHD were randomised to receive either weekly administered \nSomatropin Biopartners (0.5 mg/kg/week) or daily administered recombinant hGH (0.03 mg/kg/day) \nfor 12 months. The results showed weekly administered Somatropin Biopartners to be non inferior to \ndaily administered recombinant hGH with respect to the primary endpoint of height velocity after \n12 months. Similar results were achieved for all other parameters assessed including height SDS \n(standard deviation score), bone maturation, IGF-I and IGF BP-3. In the children receiving \nSomatropin Biopartners a higher incidence of (non-serious) injection site reactions and a higher rate of \nformation of (non-neutralising) antibodies against somatropin as compared to children with daily \nadministered recombinant growth hormone were observed (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing repeated weekly subcutaneous administration of a mean dose of 0.5 mg/kg prolonged \nrelease somatropin to prepubertal children with GHD the Cmax and tmax of plasma hGH were about \n60.7 ng/mL and 12.0 h respectively. In general, Cmax and AUC increased approximately proportionally \nwith dose over a dose range of 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg in prepubertal children with GHD. The apparent \nterminal half-life was about 7.4 h in children, presumably reflecting slow absorption from the site of \ninjection. \nThe tmax was later and the half-life longer following the administration of Somatropin Biopartners than \nwhen immediate release products had been previously administered once daily to the same subjects \nreflecting the slower and more prolonged release of hGH from the site of injection of Somatropin \nBiopartners. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo accumulation of hGH following multiple dosing of this medicinal product has been observed. \n \nBiotransformation / Elimination \n \nThe metabolic fate of hGH involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidney. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in dogs and juvenile monkeys showed \nthat Somatropin Biopartners released recombinant hGH in a prolonged manner and increased serum \nIGF-I for an extended period up to 5-6 days. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nAnimal studies with this medicinal product are not sufficient to fully assess the reproductive toxicity \npotential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin products there is no \nevidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions to the embryo or foetus. Doses in excess of human \ntherapeutic doses have shown adverse effects on reproductive function in male and female rats and \nmale dogs, possibly through disruption of hormonal regulation. In rabbits and monkeys no adverse \neffects were observed. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies with Somatropin Biopartners have not been conducted. There are no \nspecific studies which address local tolerance in animals after subcutaneous injection, but data \navailable from the repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed swelling and inflammatory infiltrate at the \ninjection sites. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n6.

The solvent vial should be warmed to room temperature and the powder vial \nshould be tapped and shaken to ensure the powder is moving freely. After removal of the protective \ncaps from the top of both vials the rubber stoppers should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 1 mL \ngraduated syringe with 19 Gauge or wider needle should be used for withdrawing the solvent from its \nvial. The syringe should be filled with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the solvent for \ninjection and the air injected into the solvent vial to make it easier to withdraw the solvent. The vial \nshould be turned upside down, with the syringe in and the tip of the needle should be placed in the \nsolvent. To remove any bubbles, the syringe should be tapped gently. The plunger should be pushed \nup gently, until all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. The syringe should be filled with \nthe correct volume of the solvent for injection as listed above and the syringe needle withdrawn from \nthe vial subsequently. Any remaining solvent should not be used for a second preparation. \n \nHolding the needle against the inside vial wall, the entire contents of the syringe should be injected \ninto the powder vial. Without touching the rubber top the vial should be swirled vigorously until the \ncontent is completely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to \n90 seconds. The swirling should only be stopped once the suspension appears uniform, white and all \nthe powder on the bottom is dispersed. After reconstitution the medicinal product should be used \nimmediately before the suspension settles. If not used immediately, the suspension must be \nreconstituted again by swirling immediately before injection. The appropriate volume should be \nwithdrawn in a sterile syringe via a sterile 26-gauge needle: The vial should be turned upside down, \nwith the syringe in, and the tip of the needle should be placed in the suspension which is then slowly \nwithdrawn. To remove small air bubbles the syringe should be tapped gently. The powder should be \nhomogenously suspended in the injection vehicle prior to administration. \nThe syringe should be held upright and gentle pressure applied to the plunger until a small drop of \nsuspension appears at the end of the needle. The injection site should be cleaned with an alcohol swab \nand the suspension injected over a period of 5 seconds. \n \nDetailed information on how to administer this medicinal product is provided in section 3 of the \npatient leaflet. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSomatropin Biopartners 20 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial delivers 20 mg of somatropin* (corresponding to 60 IU) \n \nAfter reconstitution, 1 mL of suspension contains 20 mg somatropin (20 mg/mL). \n \n*produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection. \n \nWhite or almost white powder. The solvent is a clear, oily liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is indicated in children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years for long-term \ntreatment of growth failure due to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDiagnosis and therapy with this medicinal product should be initiated and monitored by physicians \nadequately experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth hormone deficiency \n(GHD). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended and maximum dose is 0.5 mg/kg / week and should not be exceeded. In children, \nSomatropin Biopartners should be administered subcutaneously at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. For \ndosage instruction, see table below. \nIt is recommended that a maximum injection volume of 1 mL per injection site, corresponding to a \ndose of 20 mg of somatropin, should not be exceeded. \n \nFor children up to 20 kg Somatropin Biopartners 10 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release \nsuspension for injection is available. \nThe maximum retrievable amount of somatropin in one vial of suspension is 20 mg which is sufficient \nfor administration in children of up to 40 kg bodyweight. For children heavier than 40 kg, two vials (a \n10 mg and a 20 mg vial or two vials of 20 mg) can be used according to the body weight as indicated \nin the table below. The maximum injection volume per injection site should not exceed 1 mL. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\nTherefore, in children weighing more than 40 kg the overall injection volume must be divided into \nequal parts between two injection sites, as more than 1 mL of suspension is required. \n \nConversion from patient body weight to dose, number of vials, total injection volume and \nnumber of injections in paediatric patients \n \n\nPatient \nbodyweight \n\n(kg) \n\nDose \n(mg) \n\nVials and solvent required \nfor preparation of one dose* \n\nInjection volume \n(mL) \n\nNumber of \ninjections \nper dose \n\n4 2 \n\nOne 10-mg vial reconstituted \nwith 0.7 mL solvent \n\n0.1 \n\n1 \n \n\n6 3 0.15 \n8 4 0.2 \n\n10 5 0.25 \n12 6 0.3 \n14 7 0.35 \n16 8 0.4 \n18 9 0.45 \n20 10 0.5 \n22 11 \n\nOne 20-mg vial reconstituted \n with 1.2 mL solvent \n\n \n\n0.55 \n24 12 0.6 \n26 13 0.65 \n28 14 0.7 \n30 15 0.75 \n32 16 0.8 \n34 17 0.85 \n36 18 0.9 \n38 19 0.95 \n40 20 1.0 \n42 21 \n\nOne 10-mg vial reconstituted \nwith 0.7 mL solvent \n\nand \nOne 20-mg vial reconstituted \n\nwith 1.2 mL solvent \n \n\n1.05 \n\n2 \n\n44 22 1.1 \n46 23 1.15 \n48 24 1.2 \n50 25 1.25 \n52 26 1.3 \n54 27 1.35 \n56 28 1.4 \n58 29 1.45 \n60 30 1.5 \n62 31 \n\nTwo 20-mg vials reconstituted\nwith 1.2 mL solvent each \n\n \n\n1.55 \n64 32 1.6 \n66 33 1.65 \n68 34 1.7 \n70 35 1.75 \n72 36 1.8 \n74 37 1.85 \n76 38 1.9 \n78 39 1.95 \n80 40 2.0 \n\n \n* Each vial contains an overfill of somatropin powder to allow the withdrawal of the required amount \nof somatropin when reconstituted. (see section 6.6). \n \nTreatment with this medicinal product should be continued until final height has been reached or until \nepiphyseal closure. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n\nWhere childhood-onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full \nsomatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal \npeak bone mass defined as a T score > - 1 (i.e. standardised to average adult peak bone mass measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account gender and ethnicity) is one of the \ntherapeutic objectives during the transition period. Once a normal peak bone mass is attained patients \nshould be switched to Somatropin Biopartners for adults, if clinically indicated, and the dosing \nrecommendation for adults should be followed. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nNo information in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is available and particular dose \nrecommendations cannot be given. \n \nPaediatric population (below 2 years of age) \nSomatropin Biopartners should not be used in infants below the age of 2 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe patient or carer should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration procedure \nbefore being allowed to (self-) inject. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is administered subcutaneously once a week. After reconstitution the injection \nshould be administered immediately. \n \nThe subcutaneous injection should always be administered at the same time of the day to increase \ncompliance and the site of injection must be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity. Intracranial \n\ntumours must be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to the initiation of \ngrowth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour \n(re)growth. \n\n\uf0b7 Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. \n\uf0b7 Somatropin treatment must not be started in patients with acute critical illness due to \n\ncomplications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or to \npatients having acute respiratory failure or similar conditions. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies \n \nPatients with prior malignancies should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence. \n \nIn paediatric patients there is no evidence that growth hormone replacement influences the recurrence \nrate or regrowth of intracranial neoplasms, but standard clinical practice requires regular pituitary \nimaging in patients with a history of pituitary pathology. A baseline scan is recommended in these \npatients before instituting growth hormone replacement therapy. \n \nThere is an increased risk that paediatric patients with prior malignancies may develop second \nneoplasm when treated with growth hormone, especially if treatment of the primary malignancy \ninvolved radiotherapy. These patients should be counselled on risks before initiating therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n52 \n\nBenign intracranial hypertension \n \nIn cases of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea, and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for \npapilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial \nhypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be \ndiscontinued. At present, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical decision making in patients \nwith resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring \nfor symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. \n \nInsulin sensitivity \n \nBecause human growth hormone (hGH) may induce a state of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, \npatients treated with this medicinal product should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance. \nIn patients with an already manifest diabetes mellitus, the anti-diabetic therapy might require \nadjustment when somatropin treatment is initiated. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or \nadditional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. \n \nThyroid function \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction \nin serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Hypothyroidism may develop in patients \nwith central subclinical hypothyroidism after initiating therapy with growth hormone. Inadequate \ntreatment of hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to somatropin. \nIn patients with hypopituitarism receiving thyroxin replacement therapy, hyperpituitarism may \ndevelop. Thyroid function should therefore be closely monitored in all patients. \n \nAdrenal function \n \nTreatment with growth hormone may facilitate the development of adrenal insufficiency and \npotentially fatal adrenal crises in patients with organic GHD or idiopathic panhypopituitarism. It is \ntherefore crucial to assess baseline and stress doses of glucocorticoids which may need to be adjusted \nwhen growth hormone therapy is initiated. \n \nOther precautions \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated for the treatment of patients with growth failure due to \nPrader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports of sleep \napnoea and sudden death after initiating growth hormone therapy in patients with Prader-Willi \nsyndrome, who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway \nobstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n \nAfter accidental intramuscular injection, hypoglycaemia may occur. \n \nPaediatric patients with endocrine disorders, including GHD, may develop slipped capital femoral \nepiphyses more frequently. Any child with the onset of a limp during growth hormone therapy should \nbe evaluated. \n \nThe recommended weekly dose in children (i.e. 0.5 mg/kg/week) should not be exceeded as there is \nlimited experience with higher doses in this patient group. \n \nLeukaemia \n \nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of GHD patients, some of whom have been treated \nwith somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is increased in growth \nhormone recipients without predisposition factors. \n \nScoliosis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\n \nProgression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin \nincreases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be \nmonitored for progression of scoliosis. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the incidence or \nseverity of scoliosis. \n \nAntibodies \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to this medicinal product. Somatropin Biopartners has given \nrise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 33% of the paediatric patients. The binding \nactivity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical consequences have been associated with their \nformation. Testing for antibodies to somatropin may be considered in patients with otherwise \nunexplained lack of growth response. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site related reactions, mostly swelling at the injection site, were reported in approximately \n43% of the paediatric patients. Few patients discontinued treatment due to injections site reactions, see \nsection 4.8. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nExcessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of hGH. Patients receiving \nconcomitant glucocorticoid therapy should have their dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory \neffect on growth. \n \nGrowth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and \nmay unmask central hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may therefore need to be \ninitiated or adjusted. \n \nGrowth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously \nundiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective. \n \nPatients taking insulin for diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during treatment with \nsomatropin. Because hGH may induce a state of insulin resistance, an adjustment of the insulin dose \nmay be required. \n \nSomatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and cyclosporine) may be increased resulting in \nlower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSomatropin Biopartners is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of this medicinal product in pregnant women. Very limited data on \nexposure to other somatropin preparations during early pregnancy did not indicate an adverse \npregnancy outcome. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section \n5.3). \nDuring normal pregnancy, levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 weeks of \ngestation, being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks. In view of this, it \nis unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth \nhormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Somatropin Biopartners is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted with Somatropin Biopartners in breast-feeding women. It is \nunknown whether somatropin or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk; however, \nabsorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely. Caution should be \nexercised when this medicinal product is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with other somatropin formulations have shown adverse effects but the available \nnonclinical data are considered insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the use in humans (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical trials included approximately 530 patients treated with Somatropin Biopartners. When \nadverse reactions occurred, they tended to be transient and severity was generally mild to moderate. \nThe safety profile of Somatropin Biopartners is generally consistent with the well known safety profile \nof daily growth hormone treatments. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were injection \nsite related reactions, peripheral oedema, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypothyroidism \nand decreased free thyroxine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been observed under treatment with Somatropin Biopartners in a \n12-month controlled comparative clinical study in 178 treatment na\u00efve children with growth failure \ndue to insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone and in a dose finding study. Additional \nreports based on published information for daily growth hormone treatments are listed with asterisks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \nImmune system disorders \nVery common: Formation of antibodies against growth hormone (33%), see section \u201cDescriptions of \nselected adverse reactions\u201d, under \u201cImmunogenicity\u201d \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\nEndocrine disorders \nCommon: Hypercortisolism (7.7%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), adrenal cortical insufficiency (3.3%), \nhypothyreosis secondary to TSH deficiency (2.6%), decreased free thyroxine (4.4%), increased blood \nTSH (2.2%) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Mild hyperglycaemia* \nNot known: Insulin resistance* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery rare: insomnia* \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache (4.4%), lethargy (1.1%), dizziness (2.6%) \nRare: paraesthesia* \n \nVascular disorders \nRare: hypertension* \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: vomitting (1.1%), abdominal pain (1.1%) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: pigmentation disorder (1.1%) \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: arthralgia (1.1%), pain in extremities (5.1%) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nVery rare: gynaecomastia* \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling (30.8%) \nCommon: injection site pain (9.9%), injection site discolouration (8.8%), injection site erythema \n(7.7%), injection site nodule (4.4%), injection site reaction (1.1%), injection site warmth (1.1%), \npyrexia (2.6%), oedema (local and generalised)* \n \nInvestigations \nCommon: decreased blood cortisol (2.2%) \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions in children were injection site related reactions, most \nof them being mild to moderate in intensity. Few patients discontinued treatment due to injections site \nreactions. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the pivotal paediatric study, antibody responses to somatropin at two or more consecutive visits \nwere observed in 33% of the patients. No effect on safety or efficacy was observed. It is unlikely that \nthe antibody responses to treatment with Somatropin Biopartners are of clinical relevance. \n \nWith regard to antibodies against host cell proteins, low anti-S. cerevisiae protein antibody titres \nsimilar to levels in the normal untreated population were found in some patients treated with this \nmedicinal product. The generation of such antibodies with low binding activity is unlikely to be \nclinically relevant. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n56 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Due to the \nprolonged-release characteristics of this medicinal product peak levels of growth hormone can be \nexpected approximately 15 hours after injection, see section 5.2. Long term over-dosing could result in \nsigns and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of hGH excess. \n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nagonists, ATC code: H01AC01 \n \nThe somatropin in this medicinal product is a polypeptide hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It has \n191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons. The amino acid sequence of the \nactive substance is identical to that of hGH of pituitary origin. The somatropin in this medicinal \nproduct is synthesised in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe biological effects of somatropin are equivalent to those of hGH of pituitary origin. \n \nThe most prominent effect of somatropin in children is the stimulation of the growth plates of long \nbones. Additionally, it promotes cellular protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nSomatropin stimulates lipid metabolism; it increases plasma fatty acids and high-density lipoprotein \n(HDL)-cholesterols, and decreases total plasma cholesterol. \n \nSomatropin therapy has a beneficial effect on body composition in patients with -GHD, in that body \nfat stores are reduced and lean body mass is increased. Long-term therapy in growth \nhormone-deficient patients increases bone mineral density. \n \nSomatropin may induce insulin resistance. Large doses of somatropin may impair glucose tolerance. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn a randomized, parallel-group, multicentre Phase III study, 178 children between 3 and 12 years of \nage with organic and/or idiopathic GHD were randomised to receive either weekly administered \nSomatropin Biopartners (0.5 mg/kg/week) or daily administered recombinant hGH (0.03 mg/kg/day) \nfor 12 months. The results showed weekly administered Somatropin Biopartners to be non inferior to \ndaily administered recombinant hGH with respect to the primary endpoint of height velocity after \n12 months. Similar results were achieved for all other parameters assessed including height SDS \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n57 \n\n(standard deviation score), bone maturation, IGF-I and IGF BP-3. In the children receiving \nSomatropin Biopartners a higher incidence of (non-serious) injection site reactions and a higher rate of \nformation of (non-neutralising) antibodies against somatropin as compared to children with daily \nadministered recombinant growth hormone were observed (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing repeated weekly subcutaneous administration of a mean dose of 0.5 mg/kg prolonged \nrelease somatropin to prepubertal children with GHD the Cmax and tmax of plasma hGH were about \n60.7 ng/mL and 12.0 h respectively. In general, Cmax and AUC increased approximately proportionally \nwith dose over a dose range of 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg in prepubertal children with GHD. The apparent \nterminal half-life was about 7.4 h in children, presumably reflecting slow absorption from the site of \ninjection. \nThe tmax was later and the half-life longer following the administration of Somatropin Biopartners than \nwhen immediate release products had been previously administered once daily to the same subjects \nreflecting the slower and more prolonged release of hGH from the site of injection of Somatropin \nBiopartners. \n \nDistribution \n \nNo accumulation of hGH following multiple dosing of this medicinal product has been observed. \n \nBiotransformation / Elimination \n \nThe metabolic fate of hGH involves classical protein catabolism in both the liver and kidney. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in dogs and juvenile monkeys showed \nthat Somatropin Biopartners released recombinant hGH in a prolonged manner and increased serum \nIGF-I for an extended period up to 5-6 days. \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nAnimal studies with this medicinal product are not sufficient to fully assess the reproductive toxicity \npotential. From reproductive toxicity studies performed with other somatropin products there is no \nevidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions to the embryo or foetus. Doses in excess of human \ntherapeutic doses have shown adverse effects on reproductive function in male and female rats and \nmale dogs, possibly through disruption of hormonal regulation. In rabbits and monkeys no adverse \neffects were observed. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies with Somatropin Biopartners have not been conducted. There are no \nspecific studies which address local tolerance in animals after subcutaneous injection, but data \navailable from the repeated-dose toxicity studies revealed swelling and inflammatory infiltrate at the \ninjection sites. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n58 \n\n6.

Do not freeze. \nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted medicinal product, see section 6.3 \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nPowder: Vial (type I glass) closed with a rubber stopper (butyl) and a green flip-off cap (aluminium \nand plastic). \nSolvent: Vial (Type I glass) closed with a rubber stopper (butyl) and a flip-off cap (aluminium and \nplastic). \n \nEach vial of powder delivers 20 mg somatropin; each vial of solvent contains 1.5 mL liquid. \n \nPack sizes: \n1 vial of powder and 1 vial of solvent. \n4 vials of powder and 4 vials of solvent. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nReconstitution \n \nSomatropin Biopartners 20 mg should be reconstituted with 1.2 mL solvent. \n \nThe suspension should appear uniform and white. \n \nThe 20-mg vial contains an overfill of somatropin powder to allow the withdrawal of up to 20 mg \n(1 mL suspension) of somatropin when reconstituted. \n \nEach vial is for single use only. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n59 \n\nReconstitution and dilution should be performed using aseptic techniques to ensure the sterility of the \nprepared suspension. The solvent vial should be warmed to room temperature and the powder vial \nshould be tapped and shaken to ensure the powder is moving freely. After removal of the protective \ncaps from the top of both vials the rubber stoppers should be cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 1 mL \ngraduated syringe with 19 Gauge or wider needle should be used for withdrawing the solvent from its \nvial. The syringe should be filled with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the solvent for \ninjection and the air injected into the solvent vial to make it easier to withdraw the solvent. The vial \nshould be turned upside down, with the syringe in and the tip of the needle should be placed in the \nsolvent. To remove any bubbles, the syringe should be tapped gently. The plunger should be pushed \nup gently, until all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. The syringe should be filled with \nthe correct volume of the solvent for injection as listed above and the syringe needle withdrawn from \nthe vial subsequently. Any remaining solvent should not be used for a second preparation. \n \nHolding the needle against the inside vial wall, the entire contents of the syringe should be injected \ninto the powder vial. Without touching the rubber top the vial should be swirled vigorously until the \ncontent is completely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to \n90 seconds. The swirling should only be stopped once the suspension appears uniform, white and all \nthe powder on the bottom is dispersed. After reconstitution the medicinal product should be used \nimmediately before the suspension settles. If not used immediately, the suspension must be \nreconstituted again by swirling immediately before injection. The appropriate volume should be \nwithdrawn in a sterile syringe via a sterile 26-gauge needle: The vial should be turned upside down, \nwith the syringe in, and the tip of the needle should be placed in the suspension which is then slowly \nwithdrawn.

How to use Somatropin Biopartners \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nThis medicince is injected once a week. \n \nThe dose will be calculated by your doctor as described below. Individual doses may vary and your \ndoctor will always prescribe the minimum effective dose based on your specific need. \n \nYour dose should be checked every 6 months by your doctor. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg of somatropin injected once a week. For women taking oral \noestrogens the starting dose is usually 3 mg injected once a week. \nYour doctor may decide upon a lower starting dose. If necessary, your doctor will gradually increase \nthis dose according to your individual response to the treatment and your blood levels of a growth \nfactor called IGF-I. The blood levels of IGF-I require regular monitoring so that they can be kept \nwithin the normal range for your age and gender. \n \nDosage reductions may be necessary: \n- in patients above 60 years of age \n- in patients who develop long lasting tissue swelling caused by fluid retention or who develop \n\nabnormal sensations such as prickling, tingling and itchiness \n- to avoid the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, where the nerve running through the wrist \n\n(the median nerve) becomes squeezed, resulting in hand numbness and pain \n- following use of the medicine over an extended period of time, particularly in men. \n \nPlease also see the required adjustments described in section 2, \u2018Other medicines and Somatropin \nBiopartners\u2019. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAfter the powder is evenly mixed with the solvent provided, this medicine is injected under the skin. \nThis means that after preparation, the suspension is injected with a short needle into the fatty skin \ntissue. After the injection, growth hormone is slowly released into your body over a period of about a \nweek. \n \nInjections should always be given on the same day of the week and at the same time of day because it \nis easier to remember. \n \nIf you are injecting this medicine yourself you will be shown how to prepare and give the injection. \nDo not inject this medicine yourself unless you have received training and you understand the \nprocedure. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n85 \n\nInject the medicine as instructed by your doctor who will also tell you what dose to use and how to \ninject this dose with the vials you have been prescribed. Fatty tissue under the skin can shrink at the \nsite of injection on repeated administration at the same site. To avoid this, always change the injection \nsite between injections. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one \ninjection before it gets another one in the same place. \n \nAccidental injection of this medicine into the muscle instead of under the skin may result in blood \nsugar levels becoming too low. Contact your doctor if this happens. \n \nInformation about self-injection of Somatropin Biopartners \n \nFollow the instructions carefully step by step. \n \nCollect the following items before you begin: \n- supplied in the pack \n\n- Somatropin Biopartners vial containing active substance \n- Somatropin Biopartners vial containing 1.5 mL solvent for suspension for injection \n\n- not supplied in the pack \n- one sterile injection syringe with 19 (19G) or wider Gauge needle to withdraw the solvent \n- one sterile injection syringe with 26 Gauge (26G) needle for the injection \n- alcohol swabs \n- dry gauze or cotton pad \n- an adhesive plaster \n- disposal box for used syringes and needles \n\n \nPreparing the suspension \n \n1. Remove the carton from the refrigerator. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry \n\nthem with a clean towel before preparing your injection. This helps to prevent infection. \n \n2. Warm the solvent vial to room temperature by gently rolling it between your hands. Tap and shake \n\nthe vial of powder to make sure the powder is moving freely. \n \n3. Remove the protective caps from the top of both vials as seen in figure 3a.

Use a 1 mL graduated syringe with a 19G or wider needle for withdrawing the solvent from its vial. \nRemove the needle guard and fill the syringe with a volume of air equal to the required volume of the \nsolvent for injection, making it easier to withdraw the solvent: \n \n- 0.4 mL in a 1 mL graduated syringe for Somatropin Biopartners 2 mg \n- 0.6 mL in a 1 mL graduated syringe for Somatropin Biopartners 4 mg \n- 0.9 mL in a 1 mL graduated syringe for Somatropin Biopartners 7 mg \n\n \nInsert the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the solvent vial and inject all of the \nair into the vial.  \n \n\n \n \n\n5. Turn the vial upside down, with the syringe inside and place the tip of the needle in the solvent as \nseen in figure 5. Slowly withdraw the required volume of solvent. \nTo remove any bubbles, gently tap the syringe. Apply gentle pressure by pushing the plunger up, \nuntil all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. Continue to fill the syringe with the \ncorrect volume of the solvent for injection, as described in the text of figure 4 above. Withdraw the \nsyringe needle from the vial. Do not use any remaining solvent for a second preparation! \n\n \n\n \n \n6. Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial of powder, holding the syringe against the vial \n\nwall. Withdraw the syringe and discard it. \n \n\n \n \n\nfigure \n4 \n\nfigure \n5 \n\nfigure \n6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n87 \n\n7. Vigorously swirl the vial without touching the rubber top with your fingers until the content is \ncompletely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to 90 seconds. Only \nstop swirling the vial once the suspension appears uniform, white and all the powder on the bottom is \ndispersed. Use immediately, as the suspension may settle if left standing.  \nDo not use this medicine if you notice that it cannot be properly mixed. \n \n\n \n \nWithdrawing the suspension \n \n8. Clean the rubber stopper again with an unused alcohol swab. \n\nTake a new syringe with a 26G needle. Remove the needle guard. Insert the needle straight through \nthe centre of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper into the suspension. \n \n\n \n \n9. Turn the vial upside down, with the syringe in and place the tip of the needle in the suspension as \n\nshown in figure 9. Slowly withdraw the suspension. Because it is a thick mixture, the syringe might \nfill slowly. If the flow stops or bubbles appear, gently tap the syringe with your fingers. Apply gentle \npressure to the plunger to get rid of the bubbles. Then continue to fill the syringe with the correct \nvolume of suspension as advised by your doctor. Withdraw the syringe from the vial. \n \n\n  \n \n\nfigure \n7 \n\nfigure \n8 \n\nfigure \n9 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n88 \n\nInjecting the suspension \n \n10. Gently tap the syringe to remove small air bubbles. Hold the syringe upright. Apply gentle pressure \n\nto the plunger until a small drop of suspension appears at the end of the needle. \n \n\n \n \n11. Clean the injection site with an unused alcohol swab. Do not touch the needle or allow it to come into \n\ncontact with any surface prior to the injection. \n \n12. Gently pinch the skin that has been cleaned, to make a fold. Hold the fold between the thumb and the \n\nforefinger during the entire injection. Hold the syringe firmly by the finger grip. Insert the full length \nof the needle into the skin fold at a right angle (90 degrees) as shown in figure 12. \n\n \n\n \n \n13. Inject the suspension over a period of 5 seconds by gently pushing the plunger until the syringe is \n\nempty. Slowly release the skin during the injection. After the injection, wait a few seconds, then \nquickly withdraw the needle with the plunger still pushed down. Apply gentle pressure to the \ninjection site with a dry gauze or cotton pad. If a drop of blood appears, maintain the pressure for a \nfew moments. \nPut an adhesive plaster on the injection site. \n \nThe suspension is for immediate single use only. Any suspension remaining after the injection should \nbe discarded. \n\n \n14. Safely dispose of all used injection needles and syringes after a single use. \n \nIf you use more Somatropin Biopartners than you should \n \nIf you use more Somatropin Biopartners than you should, you should consult your doctor. \nIf you have used too much of this medicine, initially your blood sugar may decrease and become too \nlow.

Individual doses may vary and your \ndoctor will always prescribe the minimum effective dose based on your specific need. \n \nYour dose should be checked every 6 months by your doctor. \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 mg of somatropin per kilogram of body weight injected once a week. \n \nThe weekly dose of 0.5 mg of somatropin per kilogram of body weight should not be exceeded due to \nlimited experience with higher doses in children. \n \nSomatropin Biopartners 10 mg is sufficient for use in children up to 20 kg bodyweight. Somatropin \nBiopartners 20 mg is sufficient for use in children up to 40 kg bodyweight. If you are heavier than \n40 kg, two vials must be used. \n \nThe maximum injection volume per injection site should not exceed 1 mL. Therefore, if you weigh \nmore than 40 kg the overall injection volume must be divided into equal parts between two injection \nsites, as more than 1 mL of suspension is required. \n \nPlease also see the required adjustments described in section 2, \u2018Other medicines and Somatropin \nBiopartners\u2019. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAfter the powder is evenly mixed with the solvent provided, this medicine is injected under the skin. \nThis means that after preparation, the suspension is injected with a short needle into the fatty skin \ntissue.

Fatty tissue under the skin can shrink at the \nsite of injection on repeated administration at the same site. To avoid this, always change the injection \nsite between injections. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one \ninjection before it gets another one in the same place. \n \nAccidental injection of this medicine into the muscle instead of under the skin may result in blood \nsugar levels becoming too low. Contact your doctor if this happens. \n \nInformation about self-injection of Somatropin Biopartners \n \nFollow the instructions carefully step by step. \n \nCollect the following items before you begin: \n- supplied in the pack \n\n- Somatropin Biopartners vial containing active substance \n- Somatropin Biopartners vial containing 1.5 mL solvent for suspension for injection \n\n- not supplied in the pack \n- one sterile injection syringe with 19 (19G) or wider Gauge needle to withdraw the solvent \n- one sterile injection syringe with 26 Gauge (26G) needle for the injection \n- alcohol swabs \n- dry gauze or cotton pad \n- an adhesive plaster \n- disposal box for used syringes and needles \n\n \nPreparing the suspension \n \n1. Remove the carton from the refrigerator. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry \n\nthem with a clean towel before preparing your injection. This helps to prevent infection. \n \n2. Warm the solvent vial to room temperature by gently rolling it between your hands. Tap and shake \n\nthe vial of powder to make sure the powder is moving freely. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n96 \n\n3. Remove the protective caps from the top of both vials as seen in figure 3a. Clean the rubber stopper \nof both vials with an alcohol swab (figure 3b). \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n4. Use a 1 mL or 2 mL graduated syringe with a 19G or wider needle for withdrawing the solvent from \n\nits vial. Remove the needle guard and fill the syringe with a volume of air equal to the required \nvolume of the solvent for injection, making it easier to withdraw the solvent: \n \n- 0.7 mL in a 1 mL graduated syringe for Somatropin Biopartners 10 mg \n- 1.2 mL in a 2 mL graduated syringe for Somatropin Biopartners 20 mg  \n\n \nInsert the needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the solvent vial and inject all of the \nair into the vial.  \n \n\n \n \n\nfigure \n3a \n\nfigure \n3b \n\nfigure \n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n97 \n\n5. Turn the vial upside down, with the syringe inside and place the tip of the needle in the solvent as \nseen in figure 5. Slowly withdraw the required volume of solvent. \nTo remove any bubbles, gently tap the syringe. Apply gentle pressure by pushing the plunger up, \nuntil all bubbles are removed from the syringe and needle. Continue to fill the syringe with the \ncorrect volume of the solvent for injection, as described in the text of figure 4 above. Withdraw the \nsyringe needle from the vial. Do not use any remaining solvent for a second preparation! \n\n \n\n \n \n6. Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial of powder, holding the syringe against the vial \n\nwall. Withdraw the syringe and discard it. \n \n\n \n \n7. Vigorously swirl the vial without touching the rubber top with your fingers until the content is \n\ncompletely mixed. This usually takes approximately 60 seconds but can take up to 90 seconds. Only \nstop swirling the vial once the suspension appears uniform, white and all the powder on the bottom is \ndispersed. Use immediately, as the suspension may settle if left standing.  \nDo not use this medicine if you notice that it cannot be properly mixed. \n \n\n \n \n\nfigure \n5 \n\nfigure \n6 \n\nfigure \n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n98 \n\nWithdrawing the suspension \n \n8.

Insert the needle straight through \nthe centre of the vial\u2019s rubber stopper into the suspension. \n \n\n \n \n9. Turn the vial upside down, with the syringe in and place the tip of the needle in the suspension as \n\nshown in figure 9. Slowly withdraw the suspension. Because it is a thick mixture, the syringe might \nfill slowly. If the flow stops or bubbles appear, gently tap the syringe with your fingers. Apply gentle \npressure to the plunger to get rid of the bubbles. Then continue to fill the syringe with the correct \nvolume of suspension as advised by your doctor. Withdraw the syringe from the vial. \n \n\n  \n \nInjecting the suspension \n \n10. Gently tap the syringe to remove small air bubbles. Hold the syringe upright. Apply gentle pressure \n\nto the plunger until a small drop of suspension appears at the end of the needle. \n \n\n \n \n11. Clean the injection site with an unused alcohol swab. Do not touch the needle or allow it to come into \n\ncontact with any surface prior to the injection. \n \n\nfigure \n8 \n\nfigure \n9 \n\nfigure \n10 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n99 \n\n12. Gently pinch the skin that has been cleaned, to make a fold. Hold the fold between the thumb and the \nforefinger during the entire injection. Hold the syringe firmly by the finger grip. Insert the full length \nof the needle into the skin fold at a right angle (90 degrees) as shown in figure 12. \n\n \n\n \n \n13. Inject the suspension over a period of 5 seconds by gently pushing the plunger until the syringe is \n\nempty. Slowly release the skin during the injection. After the injection, wait a few seconds, then \nquickly withdraw the needle with the plunger still pushed down. Apply gentle pressure to the \ninjection site with a dry gauze or cotton pad. If a drop of blood appears, maintain the pressure for a \nfew moments. \nPut an adhesive plaster on the injection site. \n \nThe suspension is for immediate single use only. Any suspension remaining after the injection should \nbe discarded. \n\n \n14. Safely dispose of all used injection needles and syringes after a single use. \n \nIf you use more Somatropin Biopartners than you should \n \nIf you use more Somatropin Biopartners than you should, you should consult your doctor. \nIf you have used too much of this medicine, initially your blood sugar may decrease and become too \nlow. Subsequently, it may increase and become too high. Prolonged overdose may result in a greater \nthan normal growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone. \n \nIf you forget to use Somatropin Biopartners \n \nThis medicine is used once a week. It is important to use each dose at the scheduled time. If you miss a \ndose, contact your doctor who will help establish a new dosing schedule.

growth hormones. it is not known how often this may occur, but if you suspect that this is the case, contact your doctor since the treatment may have to be stopped. side effects can occur with the following frequencies: common, may affect up to 1 in 10 people - virus infection known as herpes simplex - skin tag (a form of harmless skin growth) - tiredness - weakness, feeling unwell - face swelling - thirst - pain, chest pain, pain at the injection site - pain in the back, arms, legs, shoulders, bones, joints - sleeplessness - decreased sensation, numbness and tingling in fingers and palm of the hand due to squeezed nerve at wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) - dizziness, sleepiness - muscular or bone stiffness, weakness of the muscles, muscle pain, feeling of heaviness - inflammation of the tendons, joint swelling, joint inflammation - reddening of the eyes, reduced vision, vertigo (a feeling of dizziness or spinning) - increased or irregular heart rate - high blood pressure - nosebleed - nausea - increased level of bilirubin, a substance produced by the liver - inflammation of the gall bladder - acne, increased sweating, skin rash - allergic skin reactions such as redness, irritation, itching - blood in the urine - nipple pain - reduced function of the adrenal gland (which could show as tiredness) - reduced function of the thyroid gland - increased fat levels in the blood - weight gain - development of substances (antibodies) in the blood that bind to growth hormone - changes in blood test results such as a change in the number of white blood cells or increased levels of insulin, sugar, sodium or certain fatty substances in the blood - changes in liver test results - a type of benign brain tumour called craniopharyngioma 90 uncommon, may affect up to 1 in 100 people - enlargement of the male breast rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people - symptoms of increased pressure in the skull such as severe and recurrent headache, visual changes, nausea and/or vomiting not known, frequency cannot be estimated from the available data - a reduced response to insulin (insulin resistance) reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by
