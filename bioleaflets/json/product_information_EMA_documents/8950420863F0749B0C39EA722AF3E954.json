NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nOvitrelle 250 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 250 micrograms choriogonadotropin alfa* (equivalent to \napproximately 6,500 IU) in 0.5 mL solution.\n\n* recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin, r-hCG produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells \nby recombinant DNA technology\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe.\n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution.\nThe pH of the solution is 7.0 ± 0.3, its osmolality 250-400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOvitrelle is indicated in the treatment of\n\n Adult women undergoing superovulation prior to assisted reproductive techniques such as in \nvitro fertilisation (IVF): Ovitrelle is administered to trigger final follicular maturation and \nluteinisation after stimulation of follicular growth,\n\n Anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory adult women: Ovitrelle is administered to trigger ovulation and \nluteinisation in anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory women after stimulation of follicular growth.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Ovitrelle should be performed under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\nThe maximum dose is 250 micrograms. The following dose regimen should be used:\n\n Women undergoing superovulation prior to assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro \nfertilisation (IVF):\n\nOne pre-filled syringe of Ovitrelle (250 micrograms) is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last \nadministration of a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) \npreparation, i.e. when optimal stimulation of follicular growth is achieved.\n\n Anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory women: \nOne pre-filled syringe of Ovitrelle (250 micrograms) is administered 24 to 48 hours after optimal \nstimulation of follicular growth is achieved. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, \nand the day after, Ovitrelle injection.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Ovitrelle in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Ovitrelle in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nFor subcutaneous use. Self-administration of Ovitrelle should only be performed by patients who are \nadequately trained and have access to expert advice.\nOvitrelle is for single use only.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n Tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\n Ovarian enlargement or cyst due to reasons other than polycystic ovarian disease\n Gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology\n Ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n Extrauterine pregnancy in the previous 3 months\n Active thromboembolic disorders\n Primary ovarian failure\n Malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n Postmenopausal women\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, \nand appropriate specific treatment given.\nThere is no clinical experience with Ovitrelle in the treatment of other conditions (such as corpus \nluteum insufficiency or male conditions); therefore, Ovitrelle is not indicated in these conditions.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nPatients undergoing ovarian stimulation are at an increased risk of developing OHSS due to multiple \nfollicular development.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome may become a serious medical event characterised by large \novarian cysts, which are prone to rupture, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria or the presence of ascites \nwithin a clinical picture of circulatory dysfunction. Severe OHSS could be complicated in rare cases \nby haemoperitoneum, acute pulmonary distress, ovarian torsion, and thromboembolism.\n\nTo minimise the risk of OHSS, ultrasonographic assessments of follicular development and/or \ndetermination of serum estradiol levels should be performed prior to treatment and at regular intervals \nduring treatment. In anovulation, the risk of OHSS is increased by a serum estradiol level \n> 1500 pg/mL (5400 pmol/L) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter. In assisted \nreproductive techniques, there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum estradiol > 3,000 pg/mL\n(11,000 pmol/L) and 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in diameter.\n\nOHSS due to excessive ovarian response can be avoided by withholding hCG administration. \nTherefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL\n(20,000 pmol/L) and/or when there are 30 or more follicles in total, it is recommended to withhold \n\n\n\n4\n\nhCG administration and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive \nmethods for at least 4 days.\n\nMultiple pregnancy\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births (mostly \ntwins) is increased compared with natural conception. The risk of multiple pregnancy following \nassisted reproductive techniques is related to the number of embryos replaced.\n\nAdherence to recommended Ovitrelle dose, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of \ntherapy will minimise the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy.\n\nMiscarriage \nThe rate of miscarriage, in both anovulatory patients and women undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechniques, is higher than that found in the normal population but comparable with the rates observed \nin women with other fertility problems.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nSince infertile women undergoing ART, and particularly IVF, often have tubal abnormalities, the \nincidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased. It is important to have early ultrasound \nconfirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine, and to exclude the possibility of extrauterine pregnancy.\n\nCongenital malformations\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies.\n\nThromboembolic events\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, \nhowever, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events, \nsuch as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\n\nInterference with serum or urinary testing\nFollowing administration, Ovitrelle may interfere for up to ten days with the immunological \ndetermination of serum or urinary hCG, potentially leading to a false positive pregnancy test.\nPatients should be made aware of this.\n\nOther information\nDuring Ovitrelle therapy, a minor thyroid stimulation is possible, of which the clinical relevance is \nunknown.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n“sodium-free”.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo specific interaction studies with Ovitrelle and other medicinal products have been performed;\nhowever, no clinically significant medicinal product interactions have been reported during hCG \ntherapy.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is no indication for the use of Ovitrelle during pregnancy. No clinical data on exposed \npregnancies are available. No reproduction studies with choriogonadotropin alfa in animals were \nperformed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nBreast-feeding\nOvitrelle is not indicated during breastfeeding. There are no data on the excretion of \nchoriogonadotropin alfa in milk.\n\nFertility\nOvitrelle is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOvitrelle is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn comparative trials with different doses of Ovitrelle, the following adverse reactions were found to \nbe associated with Ovitrelle in a dose-related fashion: OHSS, vomiting and nausea. OHSS was \nobserved in approximately 4% of patients treated with Ovitrelle. Severe OHSS was reported in less \nthan 0.5% of patients (see section 4.4).\n\nList of adverse reactions\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and shock\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon: Depression, irritability, restlessness\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS)\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nUncommon: Diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery rare: Mild reversible skin reactions manifesting as rash\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS\nUncommon: Severe OHSS, breast pain\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon: Tiredness, injection site reactions.\n\n\n\n6\n\nEctopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion and other complications have been reported in patients after hCG \nadministration. These are considered concomitant effects related to assisted reproductive techniques.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Ovitrelle are unknown. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay result from an overdose of Ovitrelle (see section 4.4).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA08\n\nMechanism of action\nOvitrelle is a medicinal product of choriogonadotropin alfa produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. It shares the amino acid sequence with urinary hCG. Chorionic gonadotropin binds on the \novarian theca (and granulosa) cells to a transmembrane receptor shared with the luteinising hormone, \nthe LH/CG receptor.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nThe principal pharmacodynamic activity in women is oocyte meiosis resumption, follicular rupture \n(ovulation), corpus luteum formation and production of progesterone and estradiol by the corpus \nluteum.\n\nIn women, chorionic gonadotropin acts as a surrogate luteinising hormone surge that triggers \novulation.\n\nOvitrelle is used to trigger final follicular maturation and early luteinisation after use of medicinal \nproducts for stimulation of follicular growth.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn comparative clinical trials, administration of a dose of 250 micrograms of Ovitrelle was as effective \nas 5,000 IU and 10,000 IU of urinary hCG in inducing final follicular maturation and early \nluteinisation in assisted reproductive techniques, and as effective as 5,000 IU of urinary hCG in \novulation induction.\n\nSo far, there are no signs of antibody development in humans to Ovitrelle. Repeated exposure to \nOvitrelle was investigated in male patients only. Clinical investigation in women for the indication of \nART and anovulation was limited to one treatment cycle.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid \nspace with a distribution half-life of around 4.5 hours. The steady-state volume of distribution and the \ntotal clearance are 6 l and 0.2 L/h, respectively. There are no indications that choriogonadotropin alfa \nis metabolised and excreted differently than endogenous hCG.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is eliminated from the body with a \nterminal half-life of about 30 hours, and the absolute bioavailability is about 40%.\n\nA comparative study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence \nbetween the two formulations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Studies on carcinogenic potential were not \nperformed. This is justified, given the proteinous nature of the active substance and the negative \noutcome of the genotoxicity testing.\n\nStudies on reproduction were not performed in animals.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen.\n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. \nThe pH of the solution is 7.0 ± 0.3, its osmolality 250-400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOvitrelle is indicated in the treatment of:\n\n Adult women undergoing superovulation prior to assisted reproductive techniques such as in \nvitro fertilisation (IVF): Ovitrelle is administered to trigger final follicular maturation and \nluteinisation after stimulation of follicular growth,\n\n Anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory adult women: Ovitrelle is administered to trigger ovulation and \nluteinisation in anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory women after stimulation of follicular growth.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Ovitrelle should be performed under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nPosology\nThe maximum dose is 250 micrograms. The following dose regimen should be used:\n\n Women undergoing superovulation prior to assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro\nfertilisation (IVF):\n\nOne pre-filled pen of Ovitrelle (250 micrograms) is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last \nadministration of a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) \npreparation, i.e. when optimal stimulation of follicular growth is achieved.\n\n Anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory women:\nOne pre-filled pen of Ovitrelle (250 micrograms) is administered 24 to 48 hours after optimal \nstimulation of follicular growth is achieved. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, \nand the day after, Ovitrelle injection.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Ovitrelle in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been established.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Ovitrelle in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nFor subcutaneous use. Self-administration of Ovitrelle should only be performed by patients who are \nadequately trained and have access to expert advice.\nOvitrelle is for single use only.\n\nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the “Instructions for \nuse” provided in the carton.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n Tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\n Ovarian enlargement or cyst due to reasons other than polycystic ovarian disease\n Gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology\n Ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma\n Extrauterine pregnancy in the previous 3 months\n Active thromboembolic disorders\n Primary ovarian failure\n Malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy\n Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy\n Postmenopausal women\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, \nand appropriate specific treatment given.\n\nThere is no clinical experience with Ovitrelle in the treatment of other conditions (such as corpus \nluteum insufficiency or male conditions); therefore, Ovitrelle is not indicated in these conditions.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nPatients undergoing ovarian stimulation are at an increased risk of developing OHSS due to multiple \nfollicular development.\n\nOHSS may become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts, which are prone to \nrupture, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria or the presence of ascites within a clinical picture of \ncirculatory dysfunction. Severe OHSS could be complicated in rare cases by haemoperitoneum, acute \npulmonary distress, ovarian torsion, and thromboembolism.\n\nTo minimise the risk of OHSS, ultrasonographic assessments of follicular development and/or \ndetermination of serum estradiol levels should be performed prior to treatment and at regular intervals \nduring treatment. In anovulation, the risk of OHSS is increased by a serum estradiol level \n> 1,500 pg/mL (5,400 pmol/L) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter. In assisted \nreproductive techniques, there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum estradiol > 3,000 pg/mL\n(11,000 pmol/L) and 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in diameter.\n\n\n\n11\n\nOHSS due to excessive ovarian response can be avoided by withholding hCG administration. \nTherefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as serum estradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL\n(20,000 pmol/L) and/or when there are 30 or more follicles in total, it is recommended to withhold \nhCG administration and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive \nmethods for at least 4 days. \n\nMultiple pregnancy\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births (mostly \ntwins) is increased compared with natural conception. The risk of multiple pregnancy following \nassisted reproductive techniques is related to the number of embryos replaced. \n\nAdherence to recommended Ovitrelle dose, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of \ntherapy will minimise the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy.\n\nMiscarriage \nThe rate of miscarriage, in both anovulatory patients and women undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechniques, is higher than that found in the normal population but comparable with the rates observed \nin women with other fertility problems.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nSince infertile women undergoing ART, and particularly IVF, often have tubal abnormalities, the \nincidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased. It is important to have early ultrasound \nconfirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine, and to exclude the possibility of extrauterine pregnancy.\n\nCongenital malformations\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies.\n\nThromboembolic events\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, \nhowever, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events, \nsuch as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.\n\nInterference with serum or urinary testing\nFollowing administration, Ovitrelle may interfere for up to ten days with the immunological \ndetermination of serum or urinary hCG, potentially leading to a false positive pregnancy test.\nPatients should be made aware of this.\n\nOther information\nDuring Ovitrelle therapy, a minor thyroid stimulation is possible, of which the clinical relevance is \nunknown.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n“sodium-free”.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo specific interaction studies with Ovitrelle and other medicinal products have been performed;\nhowever, no clinically significant medicinal product interactions have been reported during hCG \ntherapy.\n\n\n\n12\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere is no indication for the use of Ovitrelle during pregnancy. No clinical data on exposed \npregnancies are available. No reproduction studies with choriogonadotropin alfa in animals were \nperformed (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.\n\nBreast-feeding\nOvitrelle is not indicated during breastfeeding. There are no data on the excretion of \nchoriogonadotropin alfa in milk.\n\nFertility\nOvitrelle is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOvitrelle is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn comparative trials with different doses of Ovitrelle, the following adverse reactions were found to \nbe associated with Ovitrelle in a dose-related fashion: OHSS, vomiting and nausea. OHSS was \nobserved in approximately 4% of patients treated with Ovitrelle. Severe OHSS was reported in less \nthan 0.5% of patients (see section 4.4).\n\nList of adverse reactions\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nImmune system disorders\nVery rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and shock\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nUncommon: Depression, irritability, restlessness\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon: Headache\n\nVascular disorders\nVery rare: Thromboembolism (both in association with and separate from OHSS)\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon: Vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain\nUncommon: Diarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery rare: Mild reversible skin reactions manifesting as rash\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon: Mild or moderate OHSS\nUncommon: Severe OHSS, breast pain\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon: Tiredness, injection site reactions.\n\n\n\n13\n\nEctopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion and other complications have been reported in patients after hCG \nadministration. These are considered concomitant effects related to assisted reproductive techniques.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe effects of an overdose of Ovitrelle are unknown. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS \nmay result from an overdose of Ovitrelle (see section 4.4).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA08\n\nMechanism of action\nOvitrelle is a medicinal product of choriogonadotropin alfa produced by recombinant DNA \ntechniques. It shares the amino acid sequence with urinary hCG. Chorionic gonadotropin binds on the \novarian theca (and granulosa) cells to a transmembrane receptor shared with the luteinising hormone, \nthe LH/CG receptor.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nThe principal pharmacodynamic activity in women is oocyte meiosis resumption, follicular rupture \n(ovulation), corpus luteum formation and production of progesterone and estradiol by the corpus \nluteum.\n\nIn women, chorionic gonadotropin acts as a surrogate luteinising hormone surge that triggers \novulation.\n\nOvitrelle is used to trigger final follicular maturation and early luteinisation after use of medicinal \nproducts for stimulation of follicular growth.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn comparative clinical trials, administration of a dose of 250 micrograms of Ovitrelle was as effective \nas 5,000 IU and 10,000 IU of urinary hCG in inducing final follicular maturation and early \nluteinisation in assisted reproductive techniques, and as effective as 5,000 IU of urinary hCG in \novulation induction.\n\nSo far, there are no signs of antibody development in humans to Ovitrelle. Repeated exposure to \nOvitrelle was investigated in male patients only. Clinical investigation in women for the indication of \nART and anovulation was limited to one treatment cycle.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing intravenous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid \nspace with a distribution half-life of around 4.5 hours. The steady-state volume of distribution and the \ntotal clearance are 6 l and 0.2 L/h, respectively. There are no indications that choriogonadotropin alfa \nis metabolised and excreted differently than endogenous hCG.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is eliminated from the body with a \nterminal half-life of about 30 hours, and the absolute bioavailability is about 40%.\n\nA comparative study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence \nbetween the two formulations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Studies on carcinogenic potential were not \nperformed. This is justified, given the proteinous nature of the active substance and the negative \noutcome of the genotoxicity testing.\n\nStudies on reproduction were not performed in animals.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Ovitrelle is and what it is used for\n2. What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle\n3. How to use Ovitrelle\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Ovitrelle\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Ovitrelle is and what it is used for \n\nWhat Ovitrelle is\nOvitrelle contains a medicine called ‘choriogonadotropin alfa’, made in a laboratory by a special \nrecombinant DNA technique. Choriogonadotropin alfa is similar to a hormone found naturally in your \nbody called ‘chorionic gonadotropin’, which is involved in reproduction and fertility.\n\nWhat Ovitrelle is used for\nOvitrelle is used together with other medicines:\n To help develop and ripen several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing \n\nAssisted Reproductive Techniques (procedure that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n‘in vitro fertilisation’. Other medicines will be given first to bring about the growth of several \nfollicles.\n\n To help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation induction) in women who cannot produce eggs \n(‘anovulation’), or women who produce too few eggs (‘oligo-ovulation’). Other medicines will \nbe given first to develop and ripen the follicles.\n\n2. What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle\n\nDo not use Ovitrelle\n if you are allergic to choriogonadotropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you have a tumour in a part of your brain called the ‘hypothalamus’ or ‘pituitary gland’.\n if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n if you have cancer of your ovaries, womb or breast\n if you have had a pregnancy outside of your womb (extrauterine pregnancy) within the last three \n\nmonths.\n if you have severe inflammation of your veins or blood clotting in your veins (active \n\nthromboembolic disorders).\n\n\n\n28\n\n if you have any condition that usually makes a normal pregnancy impossible, such as \nmenopause or early menopause (ovarian failure), or malformations of sexual organs\n\nDo not use Ovitrelle if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nBefore the treatment is started, your and your partner's fertility should be evaluated by a doctor \nexperienced in the treatment of fertility problems.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine may increase your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too \nmuch and become large cysts.\n\nIf you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting, or have difficulty \nin breathing, do not give yourself the Ovitrelle injection and talk to your doctor straight away (see \nsection 4). If you are developing OHSS, you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier \ncontraceptive method for at least four days.\n\nThe risk of OHSS is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are monitored closely \nthroughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound).\n\nMultiple pregnancy and/or birth defects\nWhen using Ovitrelle, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (‘multiple pregnancy’, usually twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. When undergoing Assisted Reproductive \nTechniques, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to the number of fertilised eggs or \nembryos placed inside you. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of couples with fertility\nproblems (e.g. age) may also be associated with an increased chance of birth defects.\n\nThe risk of multiple pregnancy is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are \nmonitored closely throughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and \nultrasound).\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nPregnancy outside of the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) may occur in women with damaged fallopian \ntubes (the tubes which carry the egg from the ovary to the womb). Therefore, your doctor should \nperform an early ultrasound examination to rule out the possibility of pregnancy outside the womb.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing Assisted Reproductive Techniques or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs,\nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with Ovitrelle treatment.\n\nPregnancy tests\nIf you do a pregnancy test with serum or urine after use of Ovitrelle, and up to ten days later, it may \nhappen that you get a false positive test result. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nOvitrelle is not for use in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Ovitrelle\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\n\n\n29\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Ovitrelle if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that Ovitrelle will affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nOvitrelle contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”.\n\n3. How to use Ovitrelle \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.\n\nHow much to use\n The recommended dose is 1 pre-filled syringe (250 micrograms/0.5 mL) given as a single \n\ninjection. \n Your doctor will have explained exactly when to give the injection.\n\nUsing this medicine\n Ovitrelle is intended for subcutaneous use that means given by injection under the skin.\n Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only.

What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle\n3. How to use Ovitrelle\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Ovitrelle\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Ovitrelle is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Ovitrelle is\nOvitrelle contains a medicine called ‘choriogonadotropin alfa’, made in a laboratory by a special \nrecombinant DNA technique. Choriogonadotropin alfa is similar to a hormone found naturally in your \nbody called ‘chorionic gonadotropin’, which is involved in reproduction and fertility.\n\nWhat Ovitrelle is used for\nOvitrelle is used together with other medicines:\n To help develop and ripen several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing \n\nAssisted Reproductive Techniques (procedure that may help you to become pregnant) such as \n‘in vitro fertilisation’. Other medicines will be given first to bring about the growth of several \nfollicles.\n\n To help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation induction) in women who cannot produce eggs \n(‘anovulation’), or women who produce too few eggs (‘oligo-ovulation’). Other medicines will \nbe given first to develop and ripen the follicles.\n\n2. What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle\n\nDo not use Ovitrelle\n if you are allergic to choriogonadotropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n if you have a tumour in a part of your brain called the ‘hypothalamus’ or ‘pituitary gland’.\n if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin\n if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding\n if you have cancer of your ovaries, womb or breast\n if you have had a pregnancy outside of your womb (extrauterine pregnancy) within the last three \n\nmonths.\n if you have severe inflammation of your veins or blood clotting in your veins (active \n\nthromboembolic disorders).\n\n\n\n33\n\n if you have any condition that usually makes a normal pregnancy impossible, such as \nmenopause or early menopause (ovarian failure), or malformations of sexual organs.\n\nDo not use Ovitrelle if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nusing this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nBefore the treatment is started, your and your partner's fertility should be evaluated by a doctor \nexperienced in the treatment of fertility problems.\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nThis medicine may increase your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too \nmuch and become large cysts. \n\nIf you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting, or have difficulty \nin breathing, do not give yourself the Ovitrelle injection and talk to your doctor straight away (see \nsection 4). If you are developing OHSS, you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier \ncontraceptive method for at least four days.\n\nThe risk of OHSS is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are monitored closely \nthroughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound).\n\nMultiple pregnancy and/or birth defects\nWhen using Ovitrelle, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same \ntime (‘multiple pregnancy’, usually twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may \nlead to medical complications for you and your babies. When undergoing Assisted Reproductive \nTechniques, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to the number of fertilised eggs or \nembryos placed inside you. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of couples with fertility \nproblems (e.g. age) may also be associated with an increased chance of birth defects.\n\nThe risk of multiple pregnancy is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are \nmonitored closely throughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and \nultrasound).\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nPregnancy outside of the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) may occur in women with damaged fallopian \ntubes (the tubes which carry the egg from the ovary to the womb). Therefore, your doctor should \nperform an early ultrasound examination to rule out the possibility of pregnancy outside the womb.\n\nMiscarriage\nWhen undergoing Assisted Reproductive Techniques or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs,\nyou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.\n\nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)\nIf you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if \nthose happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become \nworse with Ovitrelle treatment.\n\nPregnancy tests\nIf you do a pregnancy test with serum or urine after use of Ovitrelle, and up to ten days later, it may \nhappen that you get a false positive test result. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nOvitrelle is not for use in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Ovitrelle\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\n\n\n34\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not use Ovitrelle if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt is not expected that Ovitrelle will affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nOvitrelle contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-\nfree”.\n\n3. How to use Ovitrelle \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nHow much to use\n The recommended dose is 1 pre-filled pen (250 micrograms/0.5 mL) given as a single injection.\n Your doctor will explain to you exactly when to give the injection.\n\nUsing this medicine\n If you administer Ovitrelle to yourself, please carefully read and follow the separate \n\n“Instructions for use” provided in the carton.\n Ovitrelle is intended to be given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously).\n Each pre-filled pen is for single use only.\n Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen to inject the \n\nmedicine.\n Inject Ovitrelle as your doctor or nurse taught you.\n After the injection, dispose of the used needle safely, and discard the pen.\n\nIf you use more Ovitrelle than you should\nIf too much Ovitrelle is used, there is a possibility that ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may occur. \nSee your doctor straight away if you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or \nare vomiting, or have difficulty in breathing.\n\nIf you forget to use Ovitrelle\nIf you forget to use Ovitrelle, please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

Follow the \nprocedure exactly, as it may differ from your past experience.\n\n1. How to use your Ovitrelle pre-filled pen\n\n The pen is for subcutaneous injection only.\n Inject Ovitrelle as your doctor or nurse taught you.\n This pen is for single use only. Do not share the pen.\n\n2. Before you start using your Ovitrelle pre-filled pen\n\n Wash your hands with soap and water.\n\n Find a clean area and a flat surface.\n\n Verify the expiration date on the pen label.\n\n Gather everything you need and lay it out:\n\n1. dose setting knob\n2. dose display\n3. plunger piston\n4. reservoir holder\n5. threaded needle connector\n6. pen cap\n\n7. peel-off seal tab\n8. removable needle \n9. inner needle shield\n10. outer needle cap \n11. alcohol swabs\n12. sharps disposal container\n\nPlease note: alcohol swabs and sharps disposal container are not provided in the pack.\n\n\n\n38\n\n3. Getting your Ovitrelle pre-filled pen ready for injection \n\n3.1 Take off the pen cap\n\n3.2 Prepare your needle for Injection \n Get a new needle - only use the ‘single use’ needle supplied.\n Hold the outer needle cap firmly.\n\n Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is not \ndamaged or loose.\n\n Remove the peel-off seal.\n\nCAUTION:\nIf the peel-off seal is damaged or loose, do not use the needle. Throw it away in a sharps disposal \ncontainer. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to get a new needle.\n\n\n\n39\n\n3.3. Attach the needle\n\n Screw the threaded tip of the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen into the \nouter needle cap until you feel a light resistance.\nWarning: Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could \n\nbe difficult to remove after the injection.\n\n Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently. \n\nPut it aside for later use.\n\n Hold the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen with the needle pointing \nupward.\n\n Carefully remove and discard the green inner shield.\n\n3.4. Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny drop(s) of fluid\n\n If you see a tiny drop(s) of fluid proceed to Section 4: \nSetting the dose to 250.\n\nCAUTION:\nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) at or near the needle tip, you must perform the steps on the next page. \n\n\n\n40\n\nIf you do not see a tiny drop(s) of fluid at or near the tip:\n\n1. Gently turn the dose setting knob clockwise until you see a dot (●) in the dose display. If you pass \nthis position, simply turn the dose setting knob back to the dot (●).\n\n2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.\n3. Tap the reservoir holder gently.\n4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny drop of liquid will appear at the top of the \n\nneedle; this shows that your pre-filled pen is ready for injection.\n\n5. If you do not see any liquid, you may try a second time (you may do this a maximum of two times) \nstarting from step 1 of section “If you do not see a tiny drop(s) of fluid at or near the tip” above.\n\n4. Setting the dose to 250\n\n Gently turn the dose setting knob clockwise. The dose display will show a straight line and you \nhave to keep turning until you can read the number ‘250’.\n\n Do not push or pull the dose setting button while you turn it.\n\n\n\n41\n\n The dose display should show “250”, shown in the figure below.\n\n5.
