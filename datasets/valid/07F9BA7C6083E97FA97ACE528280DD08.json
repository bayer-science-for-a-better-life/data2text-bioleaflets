CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of major depressive disorder. \nTreatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. \nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly is indicated in adults. \nFor further information see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nMajor depressive disorder \nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily with or without food. Dosages \nabove 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day have been evaluated from a safety \nperspective in clinical trials. However, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that patients not \nresponding to the initial recommended dose may benefit from dose up-titrations. \n \nTherapeutic response is usually seen after 2-4 weeks of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nAfter consolidation of the antidepressive response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several \nmonths, in order to avoid relapse. In patients responding to duloxetine, and with a history of repeated \nepisodes of major depression, further long-term treatment at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day could be \nconsidered. \n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder \nThe recommended starting dose in patients with generalised anxiety disorder is 30 mg once daily with \nor without food. In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is \nthe usual maintenance dose in most patients.  \n \nIn patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once \ndaily (please see also dosing recommendation above). \n \nDoses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety \nperspective in clinical trials. In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or \n120 mg may therefore be considered. Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and \ntolerability. \n \nAfter consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in \norder to avoid relapse. \n \nDiabetic peripheral neuropathic pain \nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. Dosages above \n60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, \nhave been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials. The plasma concentration of \nduloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see section 5.2). Hence, some patients that \nrespond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. \n \nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months. In patients with inadequate initial response, \nadditional response after this time is unlikely. \n \nThe therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. However, as \nwith any medicine, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly, especially with Duloxetine \nLilly 120 mg per day for major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety disorder, for which data are \nlimited (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDuloxetine Lilly must not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). Duloxetine Lilly must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nDuloxetine should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years for the treatment \nof major depressive disorder because of safety and efficacy concerns (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder in paediatric \npatients aged 7-17 years have not been established. Current available data are described in sections \n4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain has not \nbeen studied. No data are available. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with Duloxetine Lilly the dose \nshould be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of \nwithdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in \nthe dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be \nconsidered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use of Duloxetine Lilly with nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nDuloxetine Lilly should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin (i.e. \npotent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of \nduloxetine (see section 4.5). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe initiation of treatment with Duloxetine Lilly is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled \nhypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMania and seizures \nDuloxetine Lilly should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of \nbipolar disorder, and/or seizures. \n \nMydriasis \nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \nprescribing Duloxetine Lilly to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute \nnarrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant \nhypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of \nhypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing \nhypertension. Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood \npressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine \nshould be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart \nrate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used \nwith medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience \na sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual \ndiscontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension \nduloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nRenal impairment \nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). For patients with severe renal impairment, see \nsection 4.3. See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nAs with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may \noccur with duloxetine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents \n(including SSRIs, SNRIs tricyclic antidepressants or triptans), with agents that impair metabolism of \nserotonin such as MAOIs, or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists that may affect the \nserotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, \ncoma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). \n \nIf concomitant treatment with duloxetine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the \nserotonergic and/or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems is clinically warranted, careful observation \nof the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. \n \nSt John\u2019s wort \nAdverse reactions may be more common during concomitant use of Duloxetine Lilly and herbal \npreparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nSuicide \nMajor Depressive Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder: Depression is associated with an \nincreased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists \nuntil significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more \nof treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. It is general clinical \nexperience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. \n \nOther psychiatric conditions for which Duloxetine Lilly is prescribed can also be associated with an \nincreased risk of suicide-related events. In addition, these conditions may be co-morbid with major \ndepressive disorder. The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive \ndisorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders. \n \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nthoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed \nan increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than \n25 years old.  \n \nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). \n \nClose supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany medicinal product \ntherapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) \nshould be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts \nand unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. \n \nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: As with other medicinal products with similar \npharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours \nhave been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. Concerning risk \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nfactors for suicidality in depression, see above. Physicians should encourage patients to report any \ndistressing thoughts or feelings at any time. \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \nDuloxetine Lilly should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 \nyears. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility \n(predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in \nclinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated \nwith placebo. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be \ncarefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms (see section 5.1). In addition, long-term \nsafety data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural \ndevelopment are lacking (see section 4.8). \n \nHaemorrhage  \nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine. Duloxetine may increase the risk of postpartum \nhaemorrhage (see section 4.6). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal \nproducts known to affect platelet function (e.g. NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and in patients \nwith known bleeding tendencies. \n \nHyponatraemia \nHyponatraemia has been reported when administering Duloxetine Lilly, including cases with serum \nsodium lower than 110 mmol/l. Hyponatraemia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-\ndiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The majority of cases of hyponatraemia were reported in the \nelderly, especially when coupled with a recent history of, or condition pre-disposing to, altered fluid \nbalance. Caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatraemia, such as elderly, cirrhotic, \nor dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics.  \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \nabrupt (see section 4.8). In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation \noccurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with Duloxetine Lilly and 23% of patients taking \nplacebo. The risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI\u2019s and SNRI\u2019s may be dependent on several \nfactors including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly \nreported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, \nin some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of \ndiscontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have \ninadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 \nweeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more). It is therefore \nadvised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no \nless than 2 weeks, according to the patient\u2019s needs (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \nData on the use of Duloxetine Lilly 120 mg in elderly patients with major depressive disorder and \ngeneralised anxiety disorder are limited. Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the \nelderly with the maximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability \nto sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \npain, major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and stress urinary incontinence). The use \nof more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided. \n \nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes  \nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred \nduring the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated \nwith hepatic injury. \n \nSexual dysfunction \nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \nmay cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see section 4.8). There have been reports of long-lasting \nsexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs. \n \nSucrose \nDuloxetine Lilly hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems \nof fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nSodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not \nbe used in combination with non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or \nwithin at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, \nat least 5 days should be allowed after stopping Duloxetine Lilly before starting an MAOI (see section \n4.3). \n \nThe concomitant use of Duloxetine Lilly with selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAOI and should \nnot be given to patients treated with Duloxetine Lilly (see section 4.4). \n \nInhibitors of CYP1A2: Because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of \nduloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. \nFluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma \nclearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold. Therefore Duloxetine Lilly should \nnot be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section \n4.3). \n \nCNS medicinal products: The risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active \nmedicinal products has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. \nConsequently, caution is advised when Duloxetine Lilly is taken in combination with other centrally \nacting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. \nbenzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines). \n \nSerotonergic agents: In rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using \nSSRIs/SNRIs concomitantly with serotonergic agents. Caution is advisable if Duloxetine Lilly is used \nconcomitantly with serotonergic agents like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine \nor amitriptyline, MAOIs like moclobemide or linezolid, St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or \ntriptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 \nsubstrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily). \n  \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6: Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When \nduloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine (40 \nmg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is \nrecommended. Caution is advised if Duloxetine Lilly is co-administered with medicinal products that \nare predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as \nnortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such \nas flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n \nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine \ndoes not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not \nbeen performed. \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined \nwith oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable \nto a pharmacodynamic interaction. Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when \nduloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant \nadministration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part \nof a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline \nor in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \nAntacids and H2 antagonists: Co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-\ncontaining antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of \nduloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. \n \nInducers of CYP1A2: Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% \nlower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine \nlower than the maximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3).  \n \nTwo large observational studies do not suggest an overall increased risk of major congenital \nmalformation (one from the US including 2,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester and \none from the EU including 1,500 exposed to duloxetine during the first trimester). The analysis on \nspecific malformations such as cardiac malformations shows inconclusive results. \n \nIn the EU study, maternal exposure to duloxetine during late pregnancy (at any time from 20 weeks \ngestational age to delivery) was associated with an increased risk for preterm birth (less than 2-fold, \ncorresponding to approximately 6 additional premature births per 100 women treated with duloxetine \nlate in pregnancy). The majority occurred between 35 and 36 weeks of gestation. This association was \nnot seen in the US study. \n \nThe US observational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of \npostpartum haemorrhage following duloxetine exposure within the month prior to birth. \n \nEpidemiological data have suggested that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late \npregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). \nAlthough no studies have investigated the association of PPHN to SNRI treatment, this potential risk \n\n\n\n 9 \n\ncannot be ruled out with duloxetine taking into account the related mechanism of action (inhibition of \nthe re-uptake of serotonin).  \n \nAs with other serotonergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate \nafter maternal duloxetine use near term. Discontinuation symptoms seen with duloxetine may include \nhypotonia, tremor, jitteriness, feeding difficulty, respiratory distress and seizures. The majority of \ncases have occurred either at birth or within a few days of birth. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to \nbecome pregnant, during therapy.  \n \nBreast feeding \nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did \nnot breast feed their children. The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately \n0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the \nuse of Duloxetine Lilly while breast-feeding is not recommended. \n \nFertility \nIn animal studies, duloxetine had no effect on male fertility, and effects in females were only evident \nat doses that caused maternal toxicity. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDuloxetine Lilly may have a mild to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nDuloxetine Lilly may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Patients should be instructed that if \nthey experience sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or \noperating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with Duloxetine Lilly were nausea, \nheadache, dry mouth, somnolence, and dizziness. However, the majority of common adverse reactions \nwere mild to moderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as \ntherapy was continued.  \n \nb.

Description of selected adverse reactions \nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. \nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia or electric shock-like sensations, particularly \nin the head), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, somnolence, \nagitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, myalgia, irritability, diarrhoea, \nhyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \n \nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in \nsome patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine \ntreatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic \npain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-\ntreated patients. HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the \nextension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both \nthe duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-\ntreated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in \nduloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care \ngroup.  \n \nThe heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in \nplacebo-treated patients. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or \nQTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. \n \nd. Paediatric population \nA total of 509 paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive disorder and 241 paediatric \npatients aged 7 to 17 years with generalised anxiety disorder were treated with duloxetine in clinical \ntrials. In general, the adverse reaction profile of duloxetine in children and adolescents was similar to \nthat seen for adults. \n \nA total of 467 paediatric patients initially randomized to duloxetine in clinical trials experienced a 0.1 \nkg mean decrease in weight at 10-weeks compared with a 0.9 kg mean increase in 353 placebo-treated \npatients. Subsequently, over the four- to six-month extension period, patients on average trended \ntoward recovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from age- and \ngender-matched peers. \n \nIn studies of up to 9 months an overall mean decrease of 1% in height percentile (decrease of 2% in \nchildren (7-11 years) and increase of 0.3% in adolescents (12-17 years)) was observed in duloxetine-\ntreated paediatric patients (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n5400 mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine \nalone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin \nsyndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.   \n \nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment \n(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be \nestablished. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after \ningestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. \nDuloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange \nperfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, antidepressants, other antidepressants. ATC code: \nN06AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly \ninhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic \nand adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and \nnoradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nDuloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory \npain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of \nduloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nMajor Depressive Disorder: Duloxetine Lilly was studied in a clinical programme involving 3,158 \npatients (1,285 patient-years of exposure) meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression. The efficacy \nof Duloxetine Lilly at the recommended dose of 60 mg once a day was demonstrated in three out of \nthree randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with \nmajor depressive disorder. Overall, Duloxetine Lilly\u2019s efficacy has been demonstrated at daily doses \nbetween 60 and 120 mg in a total of five out of seven randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nfixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the \n17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score (including both the emotional and \nsomatic symptoms of depression). Response and remission rates were also statistically significantly \nhigher with Duloxetine Lilly compared with placebo. Only a small proportion of patients included in \npivotal clinical trials had severe depression (baseline HAM-D>25). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 14 \n\nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 12-weeks of acute treatment with open-label \nDuloxetine Lilly 60 mg once daily were randomised to either Duloxetine Lilly 60 mg once daily or \nplacebo for a further 6-months. Duloxetine Lilly 60 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant superiority compared to placebo (p=0.004) on the primary outcome measure, the \nprevention of depressive relapse, as measured by time to relapse. The incidence of relapse during the \n6-months double-blind follow-up period was 17% and 29% for duloxetine and placebo, respectively. \n \nDuring 52 weeks of placebo-controlled double blind treatment, duloxetine-treated patients with \nrecurrent MDD had a significantly longer symptom free period (p<0.001) compared with patients \nrandomised to placebo. All patients had previously responded to duloxetine during open-label \nduloxetine treatment (28 to 34 weeks) at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day. During the 52-week placebo-\ncontrolled double blind treatment phase 14.4% of the duloxetine-treated patients and 33.1% of the \nplacebo-treated patients experience a return of their depressive symptoms (p<0.001). \n \nThe effect of Duloxetine Lilly 60 mg once a day in elderly depressed patients (\u226565 years) was \nspecifically examined in a study that showed a statistically significant difference in the reduction of \nthe HAMD17 score for duloxetine-treated patients compared to placebo. Tolerability of Duloxetine \nLilly 60 mg once daily in elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults. However, \ndata on elderly patients exposed to the maximum dose (120mg per day) are limited and thus, caution is \nrecommended when treating this population. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder: Duloxetine Lilly demonstrated statistically significant superiority over \nplacebo in five out of five studies including four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute \nstudies and a relapse prevention study in adult patients with generalised anxiety disorder.  \n \nDuloxetine Lilly demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo as measured by \nimprovement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score and by the Sheehan Disability Scale \n(SDS) global functional impairment score. Response and remission rates were also higher with \nDuloxetine Lilly compared to placebo. Duloxetine Lilly showed comparable efficacy results to \nvenlafaxine in terms of improvements on the HAM-A total score.  \n \nIn a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 6 months of acute treatment with open-label \nDuloxetine Lilly were randomised to either Duloxetine Lilly or placebo for a further 6-months. \nDuloxetine Lilly 60 mg to 120 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant superiority \ncompared to placebo (p<0.001) on the prevention of relapse, as measured by time to relapse. The \nincidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 14% for Duloxetine Lilly \nand 42% for placebo. \n \nThe efficacy of Duloxetine Lilly 30-120 mg (flexible dosing) once a day in elderly patients (>65 \nyears) with generalised anxiety disorder was evaluated in a study that demonstrated statistically \nsignificant improvement in the HAM-A total score for duloxetine treated patients compared to placebo \ntreated patients.  The efficacy and safety of Duloxetine Lilly 30-120 mg once daily in elderly patients \nwith generalised anxiety disorder was similar to that seen in studies of younger adult patients.  \nHowever, data on elderly patients exposed to the maximum dose (120 mg per day) are limited and, \nthus, caution is recommended when using this dose with the elderly population. \n \nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: The efficacy of Duloxetine Lilly as a treatment for diabetic \nneuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed \ndose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months. Patients \nmeeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder were excluded from these trials. The primary \noutcome measure was the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary \nby patients on an 11-point Likert scale. \n \nIn both studies, Duloxetine Lilly 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain \ncompared with placebo. The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. The \ndifference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant. At least \n30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n40% for placebo. The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% \nrespectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to \nwhether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% of \npatients on placebo. Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on \nduloxetine and 30% on placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of \ntreatment were unlikely to reach this level during further treatment. \n \nIn an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of \nacute treatment of Duloxetine Lilly 60 mg once daily was maintained for a further 6-months as \nmeasured by change on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain item. \n \nPaediatric population \nDuloxetine has not been studied in patients under the age of 7.  \n \nTwo randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trials were performed in 800 paediatric patients aged 7 \nto 17 years with major depressive disorder (see section 4.2). These two studies included a 10 week \nplacebo and active (fluoxetine) controlled acute phase followed by six months period of active \ncontrolled extension treatment. Neither duloxetine (30-120 mg) nor the active control arm (fluoxetine \n20-40 mg) statistically separated from placebo on change from baseline to endpoint in the Children\u00b4s \nDepression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score. Discontinuation due to adverse events was \nhigher in patients taking duloxetine compared with those treated with fluoxetine, mostly due to nausea. \nDuring the 10-week acute treatment period, suicidal behaviours were reported (duloxetine 0/333 [0%], \nfluoxetine 2/225 [0.9%], placebo 1/220 [0.5%]). Over the entire 36-week course of the study, 6 out of \n333 patients initially randomized to duloxetine and 3 out of 225 patients initially randomized to \nfluoxetine experienced suicidal behaviour (exposure adjusted incidence 0.039 events per patient year \nfor duloxetine and 0.026 for fluoxetine). In addition, one patient who transitioned from placebo to \nduloxetine experienced a suicidal behaviour while taking duloxetine. \n \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 272 patients aged 7-17 years \nwith generalised anxiety disorder.  The study included a 10 week placebo-controlled acute phase, \nfollowed by an 18 week extension treatment period.  A flexible dose regimen was used in this study, to \nallow for slow dose escalation from 30 mg once daily to higher doses (maximum 120 mg once \ndaily).  Treatment with duloxetine showed a statistically significantly greater improvement in GAD \nsymptoms, as measured by PARS severity score for GAD (mean difference between duloxetine and \nplacebo of 2.7 points [95% CI 1.3-4.0]), after 10 weeks of treatment. The maintenance of the effect \nhas not been evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in discontinuation due to \nadverse events between duloxetine and placebo groups during the 10 week acute treatment phase. Two \npatients who transitioned from placebo to duloxetine after the acute phase experienced suicidal \nbehaviours while taking duloxetine during the extension phase. A conclusion on the overall \nbenefit/risk in this age group has not been established (see also sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nA single study has been performed in paediatric patients with juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome \n(JPFS) in which the duloxetine-treated group did not separate from placebo group for the primary \nefficacy measure. Therefore, there is no evidence of efficacy in this paediatric patient population. The \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study of duloxetine was conducted in \n184 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (mean age 15.53 years) with JPFS. The study included a 13-week \ndouble-blind period where patients were randomised to duloxetine 30 mg/60 mg, or placebo daily. \nDuloxetine did not show efficacy in reducing pain as measured by primary outcome measure of Brief \nPain Inventory (BPI) average pain score endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in \nBPI average pain score at 13 weeks was -0.97 in the placebo group, compared with -1.62 in the \nduloxetine 30/60 mg group (p = 0.052). The safety results from this study were consistent with the \nknown safety profile of duloxetine. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDuloxetine Lilly in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of major depressive \n\n\n\n 16 \n\ndisorder, diabetic neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. See section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics \nof duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.  \n \nAbsorption  \nDuloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. The \nabsolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the \ntime to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of \nabsorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance.  \n \nDistribution  \nDuloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to both albumin \nand alpha-l acid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nBiotransformation \nDuloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. Both \ncytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide \nconjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy duloxetine. Based \nupon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically \ninactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to \nCYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of \nduloxetine are higher in these patients. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). After an \nintravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 36 l/hr). \nAfter an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr (mean 101 \nl/hr). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \n Pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma \nclearance is approximately 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of clearance, \ngender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a lower dose \nfor female patients.  \n \nAge \nPharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (\u226565 years) \n(AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude \nof these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. As a general recommendation, \ncaution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nEnd stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine Cmax and AUC \nvalues compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nModerate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine. Compared \nwith healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% lower, the apparent \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nterminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in patients with moderate \nliver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not been studied in patients \nwith mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. \n \nBreast-feeding mothers \nThe disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks \npostpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast milk are \nabout one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 7 \u00b5g/day \nwhile on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics.  \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetics of duloxetine in paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with major depressive \ndisorder following oral administration of 20 to 120 mg once daily dosing regimen was characterized \nusing population modelling analyses based on data from 3 studies. The model-predicted duloxetine \nsteady state plasma concentrations in paediatric patients were mostly within the concentration range \nobserved in adult patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats. \nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \ncarcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown. Female \nmice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and \ncarcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to \nhepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. \nFemale rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a \ndecrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live \nbirth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels \nestimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the \nrabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic \nexposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC). No malformations were observed in \nanother study testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity \nstudies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below \nmaximum clinical exposure (AUC). \n \nStudies in juvenile rats reveal transient effects on neurobehaviour, as well as significantly decreased \nbody weight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation at \n45 mg/kg/day. The general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult \nrats. The no-adverse effect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Duloxetine Lilly is and what it is used for \n \nDuloxetine Lilly contains the active substance duloxetine. Duloxetine Lilly increases the levels of \nserotonin and noradrenaline in the nervous system. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly is used in adults to treat: \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 generalised anxiety disorder (chronic feeling of anxiety or nervousness) \n\u2022 diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or \n\nlike an electric shock. There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as \ntouch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain) \n\n \nDuloxetine Lilly starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of starting \ntreatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better. Tell your doctor if you do not start to feel \nbetter after this time. Your doctor may continue to give you Duloxetine Lilly when you are feeling \nbetter to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning \n \nIn people with diabetic neuropathic pain it can take some weeks before you feel better. Talk to your \ndoctor if you do not feel better after 2 months. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Duloxetine Lilly \n \nDO NOT take Duloxetine Lilly if you: \n\u2212 are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of  this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u2212 have liver disease \n\u2212 have severe kidney disease \n\u2212 are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine \n\noxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Lilly\u2019) \n\u2212 are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin \n\nwhich are used to treat some infections \n\u2212 are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Lilly\u2019)  \n\n\n\n \n\n36  \n\nTalk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you \nshould be taking Duloxetine Lilly. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nThe following are reasons why Duloxetine Lilly may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor \nbefore you take Duloxetine Lilly if you: \n- are taking other medicines to treat depression (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Lilly\u2019) \n- are taking St. John\u2019s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) \n- have kidney disease \n- have had seizures (fits) \n- have had mania \n- suffer from bipolar disorder \n- have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n- have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are \n\npregnant (see \u2018Pregnancy and breast-feeding\u2018) \n- are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are \n\nelderly) \n- are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage \n- are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see \u2018Other medicines and Duloxetine Lilly\u2019) \n \nDuloxetine Lilly may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You should \ntell your doctor if this happens to you. \n \nMedicines like Duloxetine Lilly (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction \n(see section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder \nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or \nkilling yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all \ntake time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you:  \n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself \n- are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal \n\nbehaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an \nantidepressant \n\n \nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a \nhospital straight away. \n \nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety \ndisorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression \nor anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents under 18 years of age \nDuloxetine Lilly should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, you \nshould know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, \nsuicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when \nthey take this class of medicines. Despite this, your doctor may prescribe Duloxetine Lilly for patients \nunder 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. If your doctor has prescribed \nDuloxetine Lilly for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. \nYou should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients \nunder 18 are taking Duloxetine Lilly. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, \nmaturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of Duloxetine Lilly in this age group have not \nyet been demonstrated. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37  \n\nOther medicines and Duloxetine Lilly \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  \n \nThe main ingredient of Duloxetine Lilly, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions:  \n\n\u2022 diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence \nUsing more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if \nyou are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine.  \n \nYour doctor should decide whether you can take Duloxetine Lilly with other medicines. Do not start \nor stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal \nremedies, before checking with your doctor. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take Duloxetine Lilly if you are taking, or \nhave recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine \noxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and \nlinezolid (an antibiotic). Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including \nDuloxetine Lilly, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. You must wait at least \n14 days after you have stopped taking an MAOI before you can take Duloxetine Lilly. Also, you need \nto wait at least 5 days after you stop taking Duloxetine Lilly before you take a MAOI. \n \nMedicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including \nbenzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines.  \n \nMedicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as \nparoxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as \nclomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St John\u2019s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and \nlinezolid). These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking \nany of these medicines together with Duloxetine Lilly, you should see your doctor. \n \nOral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from \nclotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly with food, drink and alcohol \nDuloxetine Lilly may be taken with or without food. Care should be taken if you drink alcohol while \nyou are being treated with Duloxetine Lilly. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are \n\ntaking Duloxetine Lilly. You should use Duloxetine Lilly only after discussing the potential \nbenefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on Duloxetine Lilly. When taken during \n\npregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called \npersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and \nappear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. If \nthis happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. \n \n\n\u2022 If you take Duloxetine Lilly near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some \nsymptoms when it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being \nborn. These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, \ntrouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you \n\n\n\n \n\n38  \n\nare concerned about your baby\u2019s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to \nadvise you.  \n\n \n\u2022 If you take Duloxetine Lilly near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of \n\nexcessive vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding \ndisorders. Your doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can \nadvise you. \n \n\n\u2022 Available data from the use of Duloxetine Lilly during the first three months of pregnancy do \nnot show an increased risk of overall birth defects in general in the child. If Duloxetine Lilly is \ntaken during the second half of pregnancy, there may be an increased risk that the infant will be \nborn early (6 additional premature infants for every 100 women who take Duloxetine Lilly in \nthe second half of pregnancy), mostly between weeks 35 and 36 of pregnancy. \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of Duloxetine Lilly while breastfeeding is \n\nnot recommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDuloxetine Lilly may have a mild to moderate effect on your ability to drive and use machines. It may \nmake you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how \nDuloxetine Lilly affects you. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly contains sucrose \nDuloxetine Lilly contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \nto some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Duloxetine Lilly \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDuloxetine Lilly is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. \n \nFor depression and diabetic neuropathic pain:  \nThe usually recommended dose of Duloxetine Lilly is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will \nprescribe the dose that is right for you.  \nFor generalised anxiety disorder: \nThe usually recommended starting dose of Duloxetine Lilly is 30 mg once a day after which most \npatients will receive 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you. \nThe dose may be adjusted up to 120 mg a day based on your response to Duloxetine Lilly. \n \nTo help you remember to take Duloxetine Lilly, you may find it easier to take it at the same times \nevery day. \n \nTalk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking Duloxetine Lilly. Do not stop taking \nDuloxetine Lilly, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your disorder properly \nis important to help you get better.  If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and may \nbecome more serious and difficult to treat. \n \nIf you take more Duloxetine Lilly than you should \nCall your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of Duloxetine Lilly \nprescribed by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a \n\n\n\n \n\n39  \n\nrare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, \nfeeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. \n \nIf you forget to take Duloxetine Lilly \nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.

of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder if you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. these may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. you may be more likely to think like this if you: - have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself - are a young adult. information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant if you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. you may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. you might ask them to tell you if they think your depression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. children and adolescents under 18 years of age duloxetine lilly should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class of medicines. despite this, your doctor may prescribe duloxetine lilly for patients under 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. if your doctor has prescribed duloxetine lilly for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. you should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms

linezolid (an antibiotic). taking a maoi together with many prescription medicines, including duloxetine lilly, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. you must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped taking an maoi before you can take duloxetine lilly. also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking duloxetine lilly before you take a maoi. medicines that cause

after the baby is born. if this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. if you take duloxetine lilly near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some symptoms when it is born. these usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being born. these symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, trouble
