NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nJorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets \nJorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nJorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets \n \nEach orodispersible tablet contains 0.5 mg of budesonide. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach 0.5 mg orodispersible tablet contains 26 mg sodium.  \n \nJorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets \n \nEach orodispersible tablet contains 1 mg of budesonide. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach 1 mg orodispersible tablet contains 26 mg sodium.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOrodispersible tablet \n \nJorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets \n \nWhite, round, biplane orodispersible tablets, with a diameter of 7.1 mm and height of 2.2 mm. They \nare debossed with “0.5” on one side. \n \nJorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets \n \nWhite, round, biplane orodispersible tablets, with a diameter of 7.1 mm and height of 2.2 mm. \n  \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJorveza is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults (older than 18 years \nof age). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment with this medicinal product should be initiated by a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. \n \nPosology \n \nInduction of remission \n \nThe recommended daily dose is 2 mg budesonide as one 1-mg-tablet in the morning and one 1-mg-\ntablet in the evening.  \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nThe usual duration of induction treatment is 6 weeks. For patients who are not appropriately \nresponding during 6 weeks the treatment can be extended to up to 12 weeks. \n \nMaintenance of remission \n \nThe recommended daily dose is 1 mg budesonide as one 0.5-mg-tablet in the morning and one 0.5-mg-\ntablet in the evening or 2 mg budesonide as one 1-mg-tablet in the morning and one 1-mg-tablet in the \nevening, depending on the individual clinical requirement of the patient.   \nA maintenance dose of 1 mg budesonide twice daily is recommended for patients with a long standing \ndisease history and/or high extent of esophageal inflammation in their acute disease state, see also \nsection 5.1. \n \nThe duration of maintenance therapy is determined by the treating physician.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThere are currently no data available for patients with renal impairment. Because budesonide is not \nexcreted via the kidneys, patients with mild to moderate impairment may be treated with caution with \nthe same doses as patients without renal impairment. Budesonide is not recommended for use in \npatients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDuring treatment of patients with hepatic impairment with other budesonide containing medicinal \nproducts, budesonide levels were increased. However, no systematic study investigating different \nlevels of hepatic impairment is available. Patients with hepatic impairment should not be treated (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Jorveza in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nThe orodispersible tablet should be taken immediately once removed from the blister package. \n \nThe orodispersible tablet should be taken after a meal. \nIt should be placed on the tip of the tongue and gently pressed against the top of the mouth, where it \nwill dissolve. This will usually take at least two minutes but can take up to 20 minutes. The \neffervescence process of the tablet starts after Joreveza comes into contact with saliva and stimulates \nthe production of further saliva. The dissolved material should be swallowed with saliva little by little \nwhile the orodispersible tablet disintegrates. The orodispersible tablet should not be taken with liquid \nor food. \n \nThere should be at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking or performing oral hygiene. Any oral \nsolutions, sprays or chewable tablets should be used at least 30 minutes before or after administration \nof Jorveza. \n \nThe orodispersible tablet should not be chewed or swallowed undissolved. These measures ensure \noptimal exposure of the esophageal mucosa to the active substance. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInfections \n \nSuppression of the inflammatory response and immune function increases the susceptibility to \ninfections and their severity. Symptoms of infections can be atypical or masked.  \n \nIn clinical studies conducted with Jorveza oral, oropharyngeal and esophageal candida infections have \nbeen observed with a high frequency (see section 4.8). \nIf indicated, symptomatic candidiasis of the mouth and throat can be treated with topical or systemic \nanti-fungal therapy whilst still continuing treatment with Jorveza. \n \nChickenpox, herpes zoster and measles can have a more serious course in patients treated with \nglucocorticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases, the vaccination status should be \nchecked, and particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. \n \nVaccines \n \nThe co-administration of live vaccines and glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as this is likely to \nreduce the immune response to vaccines. The antibody response to other vaccines may be diminished. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma, \ncataract, family history of diabetes or family history of glaucoma may be at higher risk of \nexperiencing systemic glucocorticosteroid adverse reactions (see below and section 4.8) and should \ntherefore be monitored for the occurrence of such effects. \n \nReduced liver function may affect the elimination of budesonide, causing higher systemic exposure. \nThe risk of adverse reactions (systemic glucocorticosteroid effects) will be increased. However, no \nsystematic data are available. Patients with hepatic impairment should therefore not be treated. \n \nSystemic effects of glucocorticosteroids \n \nSystemic effects of glucocorticosteroids (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal suppression, growth \nretardation, cataract, glaucoma, decreased bone mineral density and a wide range of psychiatric \neffects) may occur (see also section 4.8). These adverse reactions depend on the duration of treatment, \nconcomitant and previous glucocorticosteroid treatment and the individual sensitivity. \n \nVisual disturbance \n \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents \nwith symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for \nreferral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma \nor rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use \nof systemic and topical corticosteroids. \n \nOthers \n \nGlucocorticosteroids may cause suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and \nreduce the stress response. When patients are subject to surgery or other stresses, supplementary \nsystemic glucocorticosteroid treatment is therefore recommended. \n \nConcomitant treatment with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nInterference with serological testing \n \nBecause adrenal function may be suppressed by treatment with budesonide, an ACTH stimulation test \nfor diagnosing pituitary insufficiency might show false results (low values).  \n \nSodium content \n \nJorveza 0.5 mg and 1 mg orodispersible tablets contain 52 mg of sodium per daily dose, equivalent to \n2.6% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nCo-treatment with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, cobicistat and grapefruit juice may cause a marked increase of the plasma \nconcentration of budesonide and is expected to increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions. \nTherefore, concomitant use should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid adverse reactions, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic \ncorticosteroid adverse reactions.  \n \nKetoconazole 200 mg once daily orally increased the plasma concentration of budesonide (3 mg single \ndose) approximately 6-fold during concomitant administration. When ketoconazole was administered \napproximately 12 hours after budesonide, the plasma concentration of budesonide increased \napproximately 3-fold. \n \nOestrogens, oral contraceptives \n \nElevated plasma concentrations and enhanced effects of glucocorticosteroids have been reported in \nwomen also receiving oestrogens or oral contraceptives. No such effect has been observed with \nbudesonide and concomitant intake of low-dose combination oral contraceptives. \n \nCardiac glycosides \n \nThe action of glycoside can be potentiated by potassium deficiency which is a potential and known \nadverse reaction of glucocorticoids.  \n \nSaluretics  \n \nConcommitant use of glucocorticoids may result in enhanced potassium excretion and aggravated \nhypokalaemia. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAdministration during pregnancy should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for therapy \nwith Jorveza. There are few data of pregnancy outcomes after oral administration of budesonide in \nhumans. Although data on the use of inhaled budesonide in a large number of exposed pregnancies \nindicate no adverse effect, the maximal concentration of budesonide in plasma has to be expected to \nbe higher in the treatment with Jorveza compared to inhaled budesonide. In pregnant animals, \nbudesonide, like other glucocorticosteroids, has been shown to cause abnormalities of fetal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). The relevance of this to man has not been established.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nBudesonide is excreted in human milk (data on excretion after inhalative use is available). However, \nonly minor effects on the breast-fed child are anticipated after oral use of Jorveza within the \ntherapeutic range. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from budesonide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effect of budesonide on human fertility. Fertility was unaffected following \nbudesonide treatment in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nJorveza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nFungal infections in the mouth, pharynx and the oesophagus were the most frequently observed \nadverse reactions in clinical studies with Jorveza. In the clinical studies BUL-1/EEA and BUL-2/EER, \na total of 44 out of 268 patients (16.4%) exposed to Jorveza experienced cases of suspected fungal \ninfections associated with clinical symptoms, which were all of mild or moderate intensity. The total \nnumber of infections (including those diagnosed by endoscopy and histology without symptoms) was \n92, occurring in 72 out of 268 patients (26.9%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions observed in clinical studies with Jorveza are listed in the table below, by MedDRA \nsystem organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nMedDRA system \norgan class \n\nVery common  Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nEsophageal \ncandidiasis  \n\nOral and/or \noropharyngeal candidiasis \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders   Sleep disorder, anxiety \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache Dizziness, dysgeusia  \n\nEye disorders   Dry eye  \nVascular disorders   Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Cough, dry throat,  \noropharyngeal pain   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Gastroesophageal reflux \ndisease, nausea, oral \nparaesthesia, dyspepsia  \n\nAbdominal pain, upper \nabdominal pain, dry \nmouth, dysphagia, erosive \ngastritis, gastric ulcer, \nglossodynia, lip edema \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rash, urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \n\n Fatigue Sensation of foreign body \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nsite conditions \nInvestigations  Blood cortisol decreased  \n\n \nThe following known adverse reactions of the therapeutic class (corticosteroids, budesonide) could \nalso occur with Jorveza (frequency = not known). \n \nMedDRA system organ class Adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders Increased risk of infection \nEndocrine disorders Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal suppression, growth \n\nretardation in children \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia   \nPsychiatric disorders Depression, irritability, euphoria, psychomotor \n\nhyperactivity, aggression \nNervous system disorders Pseudotumor cerebri including papilloedema in adolescents \nEye disorders Glaucoma, cataract (including subcapsular cataract), blurred \n\nvision, central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) (see also \nsection 4.4) \n\nVascular disorders Increased risk of thrombosis, vasculitis (withdrawal \nsyndrome after long-term therapy) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Duodenal ulcers, pancreatitis, constipation \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nAllergic exanthema, petechiae, delayed wound healing, \ncontact dermatitis, ecchymosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle and joint pain, muscle weakness and twitching, \nosteoporosis, osteonecrosis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nMalaise \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of short-term overdose no emergency medical treatment is required. There is no specific \nantidote. Subsequent treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antidiarrheals, intestinal antiinflammatory/antiinfective agents, \ncorticosteroids acting locally, ATC code: A07EA06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBudesonide is a non-halogenated glucocorticosteroid, which acts primarily anti-inflammatory via \nbinding to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the treatment of EoE with Jorveza, budesonide inhibits \nantigen-stimulated secretion of many pro-inflammatory signal molecules such as thymic stromal \nlymphopoeitin, interleukin-13 and eotaxin-3 in the esophageal epithelium, which results in a \nsignificant reduction of the esophageal eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttps://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=A07\nhttps://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=A07\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \nIn a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical study (BUL-1/EEA) including 88 \nadult patients with active EoE (randomisation rate: 2:1), 1 mg budesonide given twice daily as an \norodispersible tablet for 6 weeks induced clinico-pathologic remission (defined as both peak of \n< 16 eosinophils/mm2 high power field in esophageal biopsies and no or only minimal symptoms of \ndysphagia or pain during swallowing) in 34 out of 59 patients (57.6%) versus 0/29 patients (0%) in the \nplacebo-group. Open-label extension of the treatment with 1 mg budesonide orodispersible tablet \ntwice daily for further 6 weeks in patients without remission in the double-blind phase increased the \nrate of patients with clinico-pathologic remission to 84.7%.  \n \nIn a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical study (BUL-2/EER) including \n204 adult patients with EoE in clinico-pathological remission, patients were randomised to treatment \nwith 0.5 mg budesonide twice daily (BID), 1 mg budesonide BID, or placebo (all given as \norodispersible tablets) for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was the rate of patients free of treatment failure \nwith treatment failure defined as clinical relapse (severity of dysphagia or pain during swallowing \nof ≥4 points on a 0-10 nummerical rating scale, respectively), and/or histological relapse (peak \nof ≥ 48 eosinophils/mm2 high power field), and/or food impaction requiring endoscopic intervention, \nand/or need of an endoscopic dilation, and/or premature withdrawal for any reason. Significantly more \npatients in the 0.5 mg BID (73.5%) group and the 1 mg BID (75.0%) group were free of treatment \nfailure at week 48 compared to placebo (4.4%).  \nThe most stringent secondary endpoint “deep disease remission”, i.e., deep clinical, deep endoscopic \nand histological remission showed a clinically relevant higher efficacy in the 1 mg BID group (52.9%) \ncompared to the 0.5 mg BID group (39.7%), indicating that a higher dose of budesonide is of \nadvantage to achieve and maintain deep disease remission.  \n \nFor information about the observed adverse reactions, see section 4.8. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing administration of Jorveza, budesonide is rapidly absorbed. Pharmacokinetic data following \nadministration of single doses of 1 mg budesonide to fasted healthy subjects in two different studies \nshow a median lag time of 0.17 hours (range 0.00 - 0.52 hours) and a median time to peak plasma \nconcentration of 1.00 - 1.22 hours (range 0.50 - 2.00 hours). The mean peak plasma concentration was \n0.44 - 0.49 ng/mL (range 0.18 - 1.05 ng/ml) and the area under the plasma-concentration-time curve \n(AUC0-∞) was 1.50 - 2.23 hr*ng/mL (range 0.81 - 5.14 hr*ng/ml).  \n \nSingle dose pharmacokinetic data in fasted patients with EoE are available with 4 mg budesonide: \nMedian lag-time was 0.00 hours (range 0.00 – 0.17), median time to peak plasma concentration was \n1.00 hour (range 0.67 – 2.00 hours); peak plasma concentration was 2.56 ± 1.36 ng/mL, and AUC0-12 \nwas 8.96 ± 4.21 hr*ng/mL. \n \nPatients showed a 35% increase in peak plasma concentrations and a 60% increase in AUC0-12 \ncompared to healthy subjects. \n \nDose proportionality of the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) from 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets to \n1 mg orodispersible tablets has been demonstrated.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of 1 mg budesonide to healthy \nsubjects was 35.52 ± 14.94 L/kg and 42.46 ± 23.90 L/kg following administration of 4 mg budesonide \nto patients with EoE. Plasma protein binding is on average 85-90%. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nBiotransformation \n \nMetabolism of budesonide is decreased in EoE patients compared to healthy subjects resulting in \nincreased plasma concentrations of budesonide. \n \nBudesonide undergoes extensive biotransformation by CYP3A4 in the mucosa of the small intestine \nand in the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity. The glucocorticosteroid activity of \nthe major metabolites, 6β-hydroxybudesonide and 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, is less than 1% of that of \nbudesonide. CYP3A5 does not contribute significantly to the metabolism of budesonide. \n \nElimination \n \nThe median elimination half-life is 2 - 3 hours in healthy subjects (receiving 1 mg budesonide) and \n4 - 5 hours in EoE patients (receiving 4 mg budesonide). Clearance of budesonide is about 13 –\n 15 L/hour/kg in healthy subjects and 6.54 ± 4.4 L/hour/kg in EoE patients. Budesonide is eliminated \nonly in marginal if any amounts by the kidney. No budesonide, but only budesonide metabolites were \ndetected in urine. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nA relevant proportion of budesonide is metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. The systemic exposure of \nbudesonide is considerably increased in patients with severely impaired hepatic function. No studies \nhave been conducted with Jorveza in patients with impaired liver function.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data in acute, subchronic and chronic toxicological studies with budesonide showed \natrophies of the thymus gland and adrenal cortex and a reduction especially of lymphocytes. \n \nBudesonide had no mutagenic effects in a number of in vitro and in vivo tests.  \n \nA slightly increased number of basophilic hepatic foci were observed in chronic rat studies with \nbudesonide, and in carcinogenicity studies, an increased incidence of primary hepatocellular \nneoplasms, astrocytomas (in male rats) and mammary tumours (female rats) were observed. These \ntumours are probably due to the specific steroid receptor action, increased metabolic burden and \nanabolic effects on the liver, effects which are also known from other glucocorticosteroids in rat \nstudies and therefore represent a class effect in this species. \n \nBudesonide had no effect on fertility in rats. In pregnant animals, budesonide, like other \nglucocorticosteroids, has been shown to cause foetal death and abnormalities of foetal development \n(smaller litter size, intrauterine growth retardation of foetuses and skeletal abnormalities). Some \nglucocorticoids have been reported to produce cleft palate in animals. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings to man has not been established (see section 4.6). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Jorveza is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Jorveza \n3. How to take Jorveza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Jorveza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Jorveza is and what it is used for \n \nJorveza contains the active substance budesonide, a corticosteroid medicine that reduces inflammation. \n \nIt is used in adults (older than 18 years of age) to treat eosinophilic oesophagitis, which is an \ninflammatory condition of the gullet (food pipe) that causes problems with swallowing food. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Jorveza \n \nDo not take Jorveza \n− if you are allergic to budesonide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jorveza if you have: \n− tuberculosis \n− high blood pressure \n− diabetes, or if somebody in your family has diabetes \n− weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) \n− ulcers in the stomach or first part of the small intestine (peptic ulcer) \n− increased pressure in your eye (which can cause glaucoma) or eye problems such as clouding of \n\nthe lens (cataracts) or if somebody in your family has glaucoma \n− liver disease. \n \nIf you have any of the conditions mentioned above you may be at increased risk of side effects. Your \ndoctor will decide on the appropriate measures and if it is still all right for you to take this medicine. \n \nJorveza may cause typical side effects of corticosteroid medicines and may affect all parts of the body, \nparticularly when you take this medicine at high doses and over a long time (see section 4). \n \nFurther precautions during treatment with Jorveza \n− Contact your doctor if you get blurred vision or have other problems with your vision. \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \nTake the following precautions during treatment with Jorveza because your immune system may be \nweakened: \n− Tell your doctor if you get fungal infections in the mouth, throat and gullet or if you think you \n\nhave any infection during treatment with this medicine. Symptoms of fungal infection can be \nwhite spots in the mouth and throat and difficulty in swallowing. The symptoms of some \ninfections can be unusual or less noticeable. \n\n− Keep away from people who have chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles) if you have not had \nthese infections. The effects of these illnesses can be much more severe during treatment with \nthis medicine. If you do come into contact with chickenpox or shingles, see your doctor straight \naway. Please also report your vaccination status to your doctor. \n\n− Tell your doctor if you have not yet had measles and/or if and when you have received your last \nvaccination for this disease. \n\n− If you need to be vaccinated please speak to your doctor first. \n− If you know that you are due to have an operation please tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nJorveza. \n \nJorveza could affect the results of adrenal function tests (ACTH stimulation test) ordered by your \ndoctor or in hospital. Tell your doctors that you are taking Jorveza before you have any tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nJorveza should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of this medicine \nin children younger than 18 years of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Jorveza \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some of these medicines may increase the effects of Jorveza and your doctor may wish to \nmonitor you carefully if you are taking these medicines.  \nIn particular: \n− ketoconazole or itraconazole (to treat fungal infections) \n− clarithromycin, an antibiotic medicine used to treat infections \n− ritonavir and cobicistat (to treat HIV infections) \n− oestrogens (used for hormone replacement therapy or contraception) \n− cardiac glycosides such as digoxin (medicines used to treat heart conditions) \n− diuretics (to remove excess fluid from the body). \n \nJorveza with food and drink \nYou should not drink grapefruit juice whilst you are taking this medicine as this can worsen its side \neffects. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDo not take this medicine during pregnancy without checking with your doctor first. \n \nDo not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding unless you have checked with your doctor. \nBudesonide passes in small amounts into the breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether \nyou should continue treatment and not breast-feed or if you should stop treatment over the period your \nbaby is being breast-fed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nJorveza is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nJorveza contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 52 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per daily dose. This is \nequivalent to 2.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to take Jorveza \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose for treatment of acute episodes is two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg \nbudesonide) per day. Take one 1 mg orodispersible tablet in the morning and one 1 mg orodispersible \ntablet in the evening. \n \nThe recommended dose for prevention of further episodes is two 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets (1 mg \nbudesonide) per day or two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg budesonide) per day, depending on your \nbody’s response to the treatment. Take one orodispersible tablet in the morning and one orodispersible \ntablet in the evening.  \n \nMethod of administration \nTake the orodispersible tablet immediately once removed from the blister package.  \n \nTake the orodispersible tablet after a meal. \n \nPlace the orodispersible tablet on the tip of your tongue and close your mouth. Press it gently against \nthe roof of your mouth with your tongue until it has dissolved completely (this usually takes at least \ntwo minutes but may take up to 20 minutes). Swallow the dissolved material with saliva little by little, \nas the orodispersible tablet breaks up. \nDo NOT take any liquid with the orodispersible tablet. \n \nDo not chew or swallow the undissolved orodispersible tablet. \n \nDo not eat, drink, brush your teeth or rinse your mouth for at least 30 minutes after you have taken the \norodispersible tablet. Do not use any oral solutions, sprays or chewable tablets for at least 30 minutes \nbefore or after administration of the orodispersible tablet. This will ensure that your medicine works \nproperly.  \n \nKidney and liver problems  \nIf you have any problem with your kidney or liver, talk to your doctor. If you have a kidney problem, \nyour doctor will decide if Jorveza is suitable for you. In case your kidney problems are severe, you \nshould not take Jorveza. If you have any liver disease, you should not take Jorveza. \n \nDuration of treatment \nInitially, your treatment should last about 6 to 12 weeks.  \nAfter treatment of the acute episode, your doctor will decide how long and with which dose you are to \ncontinue the treatment, depending on your condition and your response to the treatment. \n \nIf you take more Jorveza than you should \nIf you have taken too many orodispersible tablets on one occasion, take your next dose as prescribed. \nDo not take a smaller amount. Contact a doctor if you are in doubt. Take the carton and this leaflet \nwith you if possible. \n \nIf you forget to take Jorveza \nIf you miss a dose, just take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nIf you stop taking Jorveza \nSpeak to your doctor if you want to interrupt or end your treatment early.
