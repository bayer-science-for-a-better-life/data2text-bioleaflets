NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTRAZEC 60 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 60 mg nateglinide. \n \nExcipients: \nLactose monohydrate: 141.5 mg per tablet. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \n60 mg pink, round, bevelled-edge tablets with \u201cNVR\u201d marked on one side and \u201cTS\u201d on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNateglinide is indicated for combination therapy with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients \ninadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner). \n \nThe dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient\u2019s \nrequirements. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 60 mg three times daily before meals, particularly in patients who \nare near goal HbA1c. This may be increased to 120 mg three times daily. \n \nDose adjustments should be based on periodic glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. \nSince the primary therapeutic effect of Trazec is to reduce mealtime glucose, (a contributor to HbA1c), \nthe therapeutic response to Trazec may also be monitored with 1\u20132 hour post-meal glucose. \n \nThe recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be taken before the three main \nmeals. \n \nSpecific patient groups \nElderly \nThe clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its \nuse in this age group is not recommended. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. As patients \nwith severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 3\n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Although there is \na 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in \ndiabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15\u201350 ml/min) was \ncomparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects. Although safety was \nnot compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax. \n \nOthers \nIn debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and \ncareful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTrazec is contraindicated in patients with: \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n\u2022 Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, C-peptide negative) \n\u2022 Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma \n\u2022 Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nNateglinide should not be used in monotherapy. \n \nLike other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those \ntreated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8). Elderly, malnourished patients and those with \nadrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose-\nlowering effect of these treatments. The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be \nincreased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol. \n \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose \nbaseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1c <7.5%). \n \nCombination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to \nmonotherapy. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers. \n \nWhen a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, \ninfection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to \ndiscontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis. \n \nTrazec contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nof the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSpecific patient groups \nNateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment or children and \nadolescents. Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 4\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should \ntherefore be taken into account by the physician: \n \nThe following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting \nenzyme inhibitors (ACEI). \n \nThe following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, \nand beta2 agonists. \n \nWhen these medicinal products are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, \nthe patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control. \n \nData available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n \nIn an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC \n(~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination \nhalf-life. A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients \nwhen nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors. \n \nParticular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent \ninhibitors of CYP2C9, e.g. fluconazole or gemfibrozil, or in patients known to be poor metabolisers \nfor CYP2C9. \n \nInteraction studies with a 3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo. \n \nIn vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 \nand CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration \nwith nateglinide. Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nnateglinide. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are \nCYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Trazec. Similarly, there was no clinically \nsignificant pharmacokinetic interaction of Trazec with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin \nor glibenclamide. \n \nNateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nStudies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThere is no experience in pregnant women, therefore the safety of Trazec in pregnant women cannot \nbe assessed. Trazec, like other oral antidiabetic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy. \n \nNateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats. Although it is not known \nwhether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants \nmay exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating \nmachinery. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the \nwarning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of \ndriving should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nBased on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse \nreactions have been seen. Frequencies are defined as: common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1,000, \n<1/100); rare (>1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nHypoglycaemia \nAs with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after \nadministration of nateglinide. These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased \nappetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness. These were generally mild in nature and easily \nhandled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary. In completed clinical trials, symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with \nnateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, \nand 4.1% with placebo. \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare: Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia. \n \nGatrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea. \nUncommon: Vomiting. \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nRare: Elevations in liver enzymes. \n \nOther events \nOther adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Trazec-treated and \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nPost-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn a clinical study in patients, Trazec was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for \n7 days and was well tolerated. There is no experience of an overdose of Trazec in clinical trials. \nHowever, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of \nhypoglycaemic symptoms. Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological \nfindings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/or meal patterns. Severe \nhypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with \nintravenous glucose. As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of \nremoving it from the blood. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: D-phenylalanine derivative, ATC code: A10 BX 03 \n \nNateglinide is an amino acid (phenylalanine) derivative, which is chemically and pharmacologically \ndistinct from other antidiabetic agents. Nateglinide is a rapid, short-acting oral insulin secretagogue. \nIts effect is dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreas islets. \n \nEarly insulin secretion is a mechanism for the maintenance of normal glycaemic control. Nateglinide, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 6\n\nwhen taken before a meal, restores early or first phase insulin secretion, which is lost in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes, resulting in a reduction in post-meal glucose and HbA1c. \n \nNateglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta-cell membrane with characteristics \nthat distinguish it from other sulphonylurea receptor ligands. This depolarises the beta cell and leads to \nan opening of the calcium channels. The resulting calcium influx enhances insulin secretion. \nElectrophysiological studies demonstrate that nateglinide has 45\u2013300-fold selectivity for pancreatic \nbeta cell versus cardiovascular K+ATP channels. \n \nIn type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within the first 15 minutes \nfollowing an oral dose of nateglinide. This results in a blood-glucose-lowering effect throughout the \nmeal period. Insulin levels return to baseline within 3 to 4 hours, reducing post-meal \nhyperinsulinaemia. \n \nNateglinide-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is glucose-sensitive, such that less \ninsulin is secreted as glucose levels fall. Conversely, the coadministration of food or a glucose infusion \nresults in an enhancement of insulin secretion. \n \nIn combination with metformin, which mainly affected fasting plasma glucose, the effect of \nnateglinide on HbA1c was additive compared to either agent alone. \n \nNateglinide efficacy was inferior to that of metformin in monotherapy (decrease in HbA1c (%) with \nmetformin 500 mg three times daily monotherapy: \u20131.23 [95% CI: \u20131.48; \u20130.99] and with nateglinide \n120 mg three times daily monotherapy \u20130.90 [95% CI: \u20131.14; \u20130.66]). \n \nThe efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of \ngliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a \nsuperiority design. The decrease from baseline in HbA1c was \u20130.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin \ngroup and \u20130.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, [95% CI \u20130.03, 0.36]). \nBoth treatments were well tolerated. \n \nAn outcome study has not been conducted with nateglinide, therefore the long-term benefits associated \nwith improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \nNateglinide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Trazec tablets prior to a meal, with \nmean peak drug concentration generally occurring in less than 1 hour. Nateglinide is rapidly and \nalmost completely (\u2265 90%) absorbed from an oral solution. Absolute oral bioavailability is estimated \nto be 72%. In type 2 diabetic patients given Trazec over the dose range 60 to 240 mg before three \nmeals per day for one week, nateglinide showed linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and Cmax, and \ntmax was independent of dose. \n \nDistribution \nThe steady-state volume of distribution of nateglinide based on intravenous data is estimated to be \napproximately 10 litres. In vitro studies show that nateglinide is extensively bound (97\u201399%) to serum \nproteins, mainly serum albumin and to a lesser extent alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The extent of serum \nprotein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0.1\u201310 \u03bcg Trazec/ml. \n \nMetabolism \nNateglinide is extensively metabolised. The main metabolites found in humans result from \nhydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; \nactivity of the main metabolites is about 5\u20136 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively. \nMinor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only \nthe isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide. Data \navailable from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 7\n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n \nExcretion \nNateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated. Most of the [14C] nateglinide is \nexcreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 75% of \nthe administered [14C] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose. Approximately \n6\u201316% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Plasma concentrations \ndecline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of \nTrazec in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is \nno apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily. \n \nFood effect \nWhen given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected. However, \nthere is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak \nplasma concentration (tmax). It is recommended that Trazec be administered prior to meals. It is usually \ntaken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals. \n \nSub-populations \nElderly: Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide. \n \nHepatic impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 31\u201350 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15\u201330 ml/min) renal \nimpairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic \npatients. The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable \nwith healthy subjects. Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may \nbe required in view of low Cmax. \n \nGender: No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between \nmen and women. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and \npost-natal development. Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats. In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a \nhigher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed. \n \n6.

The advisability of \ndriving should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 12\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nBased on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse \nreactions have been seen. Frequencies are defined as: common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1,000, \n<1/100); rare (>1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nHypoglycaemia \nAs with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after \nadministration of nateglinide. These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased \nappetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness. These were generally mild in nature and easily \nhandled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary. In completed clinical trials, symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with \nnateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, \nand 4.1% with placebo. \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare: Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia. \n \nGatrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea. \nUncommon: Vomiting. \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nRare: Elevations in liver enzymes. \n \nOther events \nOther adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Trazec-treated and \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nPost-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn a clinical study in patients, Trazec was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for \n7 days and was well tolerated. There is no experience of an overdose of Trazec in clinical trials. \nHowever, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of \nhypoglycaemic symptoms. Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological \nfindings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/or meal patterns. Severe \nhypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with \nintravenous glucose. As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of \nremoving it from the blood. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: D-phenylalanine derivative, ATC code: A10 BX 03 \n \nNateglinide is an amino acid (phenylalanine) derivative, which is chemically and pharmacologically \ndistinct from other antidiabetic agents. Nateglinide is a rapid, short-acting oral insulin secretagogue. \nIts effect is dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreas islets. \n \nEarly insulin secretion is a mechanism for the maintenance of normal glycaemic control. Nateglinide, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 13\n\nwhen taken before a meal, restores early or first phase insulin secretion, which is lost in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes, resulting in a reduction in post-meal glucose and HbA1c. \n \nNateglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta-cell membrane with characteristics \nthat distinguish it from other sulphonylurea receptor ligands. This depolarises the beta cell and leads to \nan opening of the calcium channels. The resulting calcium influx enhances insulin secretion. \nElectrophysiological studies demonstrate that nateglinide has 45\u2013300-fold selectivity for pancreatic \nbeta cell versus cardiovascular K+ATP channels. \n \nIn type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within the first 15 minutes \nfollowing an oral dose of nateglinide. This results in a blood-glucose-lowering effect throughout the \nmeal period. Insulin levels return to baseline within 3 to 4 hours, reducing post-meal \nhyperinsulinaemia. \n \nNateglinide-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is glucose-sensitive, such that less \ninsulin is secreted as glucose levels fall. Conversely, the coadministration of food or a glucose infusion \nresults in an enhancement of insulin secretion. \n \nIn combination with metformin, which mainly affected fasting plasma glucose, the effect of \nnateglinide on HbA1c was additive compared to either agent alone. \n \nNateglinide efficacy was inferior to that of metformin in monotherapy (decrease in HbA1c (%) with \nmetformin 500 mg three times daily monotherapy: \u20131.23 [95% CI: \u20131.48; \u20130.99] and with nateglinide \n120 mg three times daily monotherapy \u20130.90 [95% CI: \u20131.14; \u20130.66]). \n \nThe efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of \ngliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a \nsuperiority design. The decrease from baseline in HbA1c was \u20130.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin \ngroup and \u20130.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, [95% CI \u20130.03, 0.36]). \nBoth treatments were well tolerated. \n \nAn outcome study has not been conducted with nateglinide, therefore the long-term benefits associated \nwith improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \nNateglinide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Trazec tablets prior to a meal, with \nmean peak drug concentration generally occurring in less than 1 hour. Nateglinide is rapidly and \nalmost completely (\u2265 90%) absorbed from an oral solution. Absolute oral bioavailability is estimated \nto be 72%. In type 2 diabetic patients given Trazec over the dose range 60 to 240 mg before three \nmeals per day for one week, nateglinide showed linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and Cmax, and \ntmax was independent of dose. \n \nDistribution \nThe steady-state volume of distribution of nateglinide based on intravenous data is estimated to be \napproximately 10 litres. In vitro studies show that nateglinide is extensively bound (97\u201399%) to serum \nproteins, mainly serum albumin and to a lesser extent alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The extent of serum \nprotein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0.1\u201310 \u03bcg Trazec/ml. \n \nMetabolism \nNateglinide is extensively metabolised. The main metabolites found in humans result from \nhydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; \nactivity of the main metabolites is about 5\u20136 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively. \nMinor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only \nthe isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide. Data \navailable from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 14\n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n \nExcretion \nNateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated. Most of the [14C] nateglinide is \nexcreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 75% of \nthe administered [14C] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose. Approximately \n6\u201316% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Plasma concentrations \ndecline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of \nTrazec in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is \nno apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily. \n \nFood effect \nWhen given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected. However, \nthere is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak \nplasma concentration (tmax). It is recommended that Trazec be administered prior to meals. It is usually \ntaken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals. \n \nSub-populations \nElderly: Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide. \n \nHepatic impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 31\u201350 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15\u201330 ml/min) renal \nimpairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic \npatients. The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable \nwith healthy subjects. Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may \nbe required in view of low Cmax. \n \nGender: No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between \nmen and women. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and \npost-natal development. Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats. In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a \nhigher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTRAZEC 180 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 180 mg nateglinide. \n \nExcipients: \nLactose monohydrate: 214 mg per tablet  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \n180 mg red, ovaloid tablets with \u201cNVR\u201d marked on one side and \u201cTSX\u201d on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNateglinide is indicated for combination therapy with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients \ninadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner). \n \nThe dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient\u2019s \nrequirements. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 60 mg three times daily before meals, particularly in patients who \nare near goal HbA1c. This may be increased to 120 mg three times daily. \n \nDose adjustments should be based on periodic glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. \nSince the primary therapeutic effect of Trazec is to reduce mealtime glucose, (a contributor to HbA1c), \nthe therapeutic response to Trazec may also be monitored with 1\u20132 hour post-meal glucose. \n \nThe recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be taken before the three main \nmeals. \n \nSpecific patient groups \nElderly \nThe clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its \nuse in this age group is not recommended. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. As patients \nwith severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 17\n\n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Although there is \na 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in \ndiabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15\u201350 ml/min) was \ncomparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects. Although safety was \nnot compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax. \n \nOthers \nIn debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and \ncareful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTrazec is contraindicated in patients with: \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n\u2022 Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, C-peptide negative) \n\u2022 Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma \n\u2022 Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nNateglinide should not be used in monotherapy. \n \nLike other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those \ntreated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8). Elderly, malnourished patients and those with \nadrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose-\nlowering effect of these treatments. The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be \nincreased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol. \n \nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose \nbaseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1C <7.5%). \n \nCombination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to \nmonotherapy. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers. \n \nWhen a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, \ninfection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to \ndiscontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis. \n \nTrazec contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nof the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSpecific patient groups \nNateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment or children and \nadolescents. Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 18\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should \ntherefore be taken into account by the physician: \n \nThe following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting \nenzyme inhibitors (ACEI). \n \nThe following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, \nand beta2 agonists. \n \nWhen these medicinal products are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, \nthe patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control. \n \nData available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n \nIn an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC \n(~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination \nhalf-life. A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients \nwhen nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors. \n \nParticular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent \ninhibitors of CYP2C9, e.g. fluconazole or gemfibrozil, or in patients known to be poor metabolisers \nfor CYP2C9. \n \nInteraction studies with a 3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo. \n \nIn vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products \nmetabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 \nand CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration \nwith nateglinide. Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nnateglinide. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are \nCYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Trazec. Similarly, there was no clinically \nsignificant pharmacokinetic interaction of Trazec with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin \nor glibenclamide. \n \nNateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nStudies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThere is no experience in pregnant women, therefore the safety of Trazec in pregnant women cannot \nbe assessed. Trazec, like other oral antidiabetic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy. \n \nNateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats. Although it is not known \nwhether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants \nmay exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating \nmachinery. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the \nwarning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of \ndriving should be considered in these circumstances. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 19\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nBased on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse \nreactions have been seen.

It is usually \ntaken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals. \n \nSub-populations \nElderly: Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide. \n \nHepatic impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 31\u201350 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15\u201330 ml/min) renal \nimpairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in \nhealthy subjects. There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic \npatients. The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable \nwith healthy subjects. Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may \nbe required in view of low Cmax. \n \nGender: No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between \nmen and women. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and \npost-natal development. Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats. In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a \nhigher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed. \n \n \n6.

WHAT TRAZEC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nTrazec is a medicine to lower blood sugar (glucose), which is taken by mouth (these medicines are \nalso known as oral anti-diabetics). \n \nIt is used by people with type 2 diabetes. (This kind of diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent \ndiabetes mellitus.) \n \nInsulin is a substance produced by a body organ called the pancreas. It helps to decrease blood sugar \nlevels, especially after meals. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the body may not start producing insulin \nquickly enough after meals. Trazec works by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin more \nquickly. This helps to keep the blood sugar controlled after meals. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe Trazec together with another oral anti-diabetic containing metformin. \n \nTrazec tablets start to act quickly after you take them and are eliminated from the body rapidly. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE TRAZEC \n \nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully, even if they are different \nfrom what is in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Trazec \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nateglinide or any of the other ingredients of Trazec. \n- if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce any insulin). \n- if you know that you have a severe liver problem. \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \nTalk to your doctor if you have any further questions or you think that any of these may apply to you. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 38\n\nTake special care with Trazec \nPeople with diabetes sometimes get symptoms of low blood sugar (also called hypoglycaemia). \nMedicines, including Trazec, may also produce symptoms of low blood sugar. \n \nIf you get any of these symptoms \u2013 feeling dizzy, light-headed, hungry, shaky or any of the other signs \nin section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d \u2013 eat or drink something containing sugar. \n \nSome people are more likely to get symptoms of low blood sugar than others. Take care \n- if you are over 65 years of age. \n- if you are undernourished. \n- if you have another medical condition that may cause low blood sugar (e.g. an under-active \n\npituitary or adrenal gland). \n \nIf any of these apply to you, monitor your blood sugar levels more carefully. \n \nTalk to your doctor \n- if you know that you have a liver problem. \n- if you have a severe kidney problem. \n- if you have problems of drug metabolism. \n- if you are due to have an operation. \n- if you have suffered a fever, an accident or an infection. \nYour treatment may need to be adjusted. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nThe amount of Trazec that you need may change if you take other medicines as these may cause your \nblood sugar levels to go up or down. \n \nIt is especially important that you tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking: \n- Beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (used, for example, to treat high \n\nblood pressure and certain heart conditions). \n- Diuretics (used in the treatment of high blood pressure). \n- Corticosteroids such as prednisone and cortisone (used to treat inflammatory disorders). \n- Inhibitors of drug metabolism such as fluconazole (used to treat fungal infection), gemfibrozil \n\n(used to treat dyslipidaemia) or sulfinpyrazone (used to treat chronic gout). \nYour doctor may adjust the dose of these medicines. \n \nFood, drink and exercise \nTake Trazec before meals (see section 3, \u201cHow to take Trazec\u201d). Its effect may be delayed if it is taken \nduring or after meals. \n \nEven though you are taking medicines for your diabetes, it is important to keep following the diet \nand/or exercise your doctor has recommended for you. \n \nWatch carefully for signs of low blood sugar, especially \n- if you have exercised more strenuously than usual. \n- if you have drunk alcohol. \n \nAlcohol may upset the control of your blood sugar so you are advised to talk to your doctor about \ndrinking alcohol while taking Trazec. If you do get symptoms of low blood sugar, eat or drink \nsomething containing sugar and talk to your doctor. \n \nTrazec and older people \nTrazec can be used by people over 65 years of age. Take special care to avoid low blood sugar. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 39\n\nTrazec and children and adolescents \nTrazec is not recommended for children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) because its effects in \nthis age group have not been studied. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Trazec if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. See your doctor as soon as \npossible if you become pregnant during treatment. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Trazec. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou are advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is particularly \nimportant if you have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or if you \nhave frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these \ncircumstances. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Trazec \nTrazec tablets contain lactose monohydrate. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE TRAZEC \n \nAlways take Trazec exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhen to take Trazec \nTake Trazec before the three main meals, usually: \n- 1 dose before breakfast \n- 1 dose before lunch \n- 1 dose before dinner \n \nIt is best to take it right before a main meal but you can take it up to 30 minutes before. \n \nDo not take it if you are not going to eat a main meal. If you miss a meal, skip that dose of Trazec and \nwait until your next meal. \n \nHow much to take \nTake Trazec as your doctor told you to. Your doctor will determine the dosage you require. \n \nThe usual dose of Trazec to start with is 60 mg before the three main meals. In some cases your doctor \nmay prescribe higher doses. The recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be \ntaken before the three main meals. \n \nSwallow the tablets whole with a glass of water before the meal. \n \nHow long to take Trazec \nTake Trazec daily until your doctor tells you to stop. \n \nIf you take more Trazec than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to a doctor straight away. If you experience \nsymptoms of low blood sugar \u2013 if you feel dizzy, light-headed, hungry, shaky, or any of the other \nsigns in section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d \u2013 eat or drink something containing sugar. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 40\n\nIf you feel as if you are about to have a severe hypoglycaemic attack (which may lead to loss of \nconsciousness or seizure), call for urgent medical help \u2013 or make sure that someone else does this for \nyou. \n \nIf you forget to take Trazec \nIf you forget to take a tablet simply take the next one before your next meal. Do not take a double dose \nof Trazec to make up for the one that you missed. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Trazec can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The side effects \ncaused by Trazec are usually mild to moderate. \n \nThe most common side effects are symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), which are usually \nmild. These include \n- sweating, \n- dizziness, \n- shaking, \n- weakness, \n- hunger, \n- feeling your heart beating fast, \n- tiredness, \n- feeling sick (nausea). \n \nThey can also be caused by lack of food or too high a dose of any anti-diabetic medicine you are \ntaking. If you do get symptoms of low blood sugar, eat or drink something containing sugar. \n \nAbdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting have been reported. \n \nRare effects are mild abnormalities in liver function tests and allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions such \nas rash and itching. \n \nA very rare effect is skin rash with blisters affecting the lips, eyes, mouth, sometimes with headache, \nfever and/or diarrhoea. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE TRAZEC \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \nStore in the original package. \nDo not use Trazec after the expiry date stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date refers to the \nlast day of that month. \nDo not use any Trazec pack that is damaged or shows signs of tampering. \nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required.

(this kind of diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.) insulin is a substance produced by a body organ called the pancreas. it helps to decrease blood sugar levels, especially after meals. in patients with type 2 diabetes, the body may not start producing insulin quickly enough after meals. trazec works by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin more quickly. this helps to keep the blood sugar controlled after meals. your doctor will prescribe trazec together with another oral anti-diabetic containing metformin. trazec tablets start to act quickly after you take them

instructions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully, even if they are different from what is in this leaflet. do not take trazec - if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nateglinide or any of the other ingredients of trazec. - if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce any insulin). - if you know that you have a severe liver problem. - if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. - if you are breast-feeding. talk to your doctor if you have any further questions or you think that any of these may apply to you. take special care with trazec people with diabetes sometimes get symptoms of low blood sugar (also called hypoglycaemia). medicines, including trazec, may also produce symptoms of low blood sugar. if you get any of these symptoms feeling dizzy, light-headed, hungry, shaky or any of the other signs in section 4, \"possible side effects\" eat or drink something containing sugar. some people are more likely to get symptoms of low blood sugar than others. take care - if you are over 65 years of age. - if you are undernourished. - if you have another medical condition that may cause low blood sugar (e.g. an under-active pituitary or adrenal gland). if any of these apply to you, monitor your blood sugar levels more carefully. talk to your doctor - if you know that you have a liver problem. - if you have a severe kidney problem. - if you have problems of drug metabolism. - if you are due to have an operation. - if you have suffered a fever, an accident or an infection. your treatment may need to be adjusted. taking other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. the amount of trazec that you need may change if you take other medicines as these may cause your blood sugar levels to go up or down. it is especially important that you tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking: - beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (used, for example, to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions). - diuretics (used in the treatment of high blood pressure). - corticosteroids such as prednisone and cortisone (used to treat inflammatory disorders). - inhibitors of drug metabolism such as fluconazole (used to treat fungal infection), gemfibrozil (used to treat dyslipidaemia) or sulfinpyrazone (used to treat chronic gout). your doctor may adjust the dose of these medicines. food, drink and exercise take trazec before meals (see section 3, \"how to take trazec\"). its effect may be delayed if it is taken during or after meals. even though you are taking medicines for your diabetes, it is important to keep following the diet and/or exercise your doctor has recommended for you. watch carefully for signs of low blood sugar, especially - if you have exercised more strenuously than usual. - if you have drunk alcohol. alcohol may upset the control of your blood sugar so you are advised to talk to your doctor about drinking alcohol while taking trazec. if you do get symptoms of low blood sugar, eat or drink something containing sugar and talk to your doctor. trazec and older people trazec can be used by people over 65 years of age. take special care to avoid low blood sugar. trazec and children and adolescents trazec is not recommended for children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) because its effects in this age group have not been studied. pregnancy and breast-feeding do not take trazec if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. see your doctor as soon as possible if you become pregnant during treatment. do not breast-feed during treatment with trazec. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast- feeding. driving and using machines you are advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. this is particularly important if you have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or if you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances. important information about some of the ingredients of trazec trazec tablets contain lactose monohydrate. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor
