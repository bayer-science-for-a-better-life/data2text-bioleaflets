This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIlumetri 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 100 mg of tildrakizumab in 1 mL. \n \nTildrakizumab is a humanised IgG1/k monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) \ncells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nThe solution is clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow. The solution pH is in the \nrange of 5.7 - 6.3 and the osmolality is between 258 and 311 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIlumetri is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIlumetri is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of plaque psoriasis.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Ilumetri is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, and 4 and every \n12 weeks thereafter.  \nIn patients with certain characteristics (e.g. high disease burden, body weight ≥ 90 kg) 200 mg may \nprovide greater efficacy.  \n \nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after \n28 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with \ncontinued treatment beyond 28 weeks.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment  \nIlumetri has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. For \nfurther information on elimination of tildrakizumab, see section 5.2. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ilumetri in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIlumetri is administered by subcutaneous injection. Injection sites should be alternated. Ilumetri should not \nbe injected into areas where the skin is affected by plaque psoriasis or is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, \nor scaly. The pre-filled syringe must not be shaken. Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only. \n \nInject the full amount of tildrakizumab according to the instructions for use provided in the package \nleaflet.  \n \nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Ilumetri if a physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. \nPatients should be instructed to inject the full amount of Ilumetri according to the instructions provided in \nthe package leaflet. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nClinically important active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nIlumetri has the potential to increase the risk of infection (see section 4.8). \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of Ilumetri in patients with a chronic infection or a \nhistory of recurrent or recent serious infection. \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of a clinically \nrelevant chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be \nclosely monitored and Ilumetri should not be administered until the infection resolves. \n \nPre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis  \n \nPrior to initiating treatment with Ilumetri, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. \nPatients receiving Ilumetri should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB during and \nafter treatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating Ilumetri in patients with a past \nhistory of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIf a serious hypersensivity reaction occurs, administration of Ilumetri should be discontinued immediately \nand appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nVaccinations \n \nPrior to initiating treatment with tildrakizumab, consider completion of all appropriate immunisations \naccording to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live viral or bacterial vaccination it \nis recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with tildrakizumab. Patients treated \nwith Ilumetri should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 17 weeks after treatment \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVaccines \n \nNo data are available on the response to live or inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines should not be given \nconcurrently with Ilumetri (see section 4.4). \n \nInteractions with cytochrome p450 \n \nConcomitant medicines affecting Ilumetri pharmacokinetics are not expected since it is cleared from the \nbody by general protein catabolism processes with no contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) \nenzymes, and it is not eliminated by renal or hepatic pathways. Furthermore, Ilumetri does not impact the \npharmacokinetics of concomitant medicines metabolized by CYP450 enzymes either through direct or \nindirect mechanisms (see section 5.2). \n \nInteractions with other immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Ilumetri in combination with other immunosupressive agents, including \nbiologics, or phototherapy has not been evaluated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for \nat least 17 weeks after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of tildrakizumab \nin pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effect with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nIlumetri during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether tildrakizumab is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in \ncynomolgus monkey have shown negligible levels of Ilumetri in milk on postnatal day 28 (see section \n5.3). In humans, during the first few days after birth antibodies may be transferred to the newborns \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthrough milk. In this short period, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be \nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Ilumetri therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of Ilumetri on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIlumetri has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, gastroenteritis, \nnausea, diarrhoea, injection site pain and back pain. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThree placebo-controlled studies (Phase 2b and two Phase 3) were integrated to evaluate the safety of \nIlumetri in comparison to placebo. A total of 1,768 patients were evaluated (705 patients on 100 mg, 708 \npatients on 200 mg and 355 patients on placebo). These 355 patients on placebo were subsequently \ncrossed over to tildrakizumab. \nAdverse reactions (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and frequency, using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from \navailable data).  \n \nTable 1. List of adverse reactions  \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass \n\nPreferred term Frequency category \n\nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infectionsa Very common  \nNervous system disorders Headache Common  \nGastrointestinal disorders Gastroenteritis Common \n\nNausea Common \nDiarrhoea Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nInjection site pain Common \n\nBack pain Common \naIncluding nasopharyngitis. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reaction \n \nImmunogenicity \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn pooled Phase 2b and Phase 3 analyses 7.3% of Ilumetri-treated patients developed antibodies to \nIlumetri. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to Ilumetri to lower efficacy and \nthe development of treatment emergent adverse events was observed.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously have been safely administered in clinical trials.  \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and that appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC17 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTildrakizumab is a humanized IgG1/k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the p19 protein \nsubunit of the interleukin-23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL-12 and inhibits its interaction with the \nIL-23 receptor. \n \nIL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. \nTildrakizumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 \nstudies enrolled a total of 1,862 patients 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a \nminimum body surface area involvement of 10%, a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of ≥3 in \nthe overall assessment (plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 5, a \nPsoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12, and who were candidates for phototherapy or \nsystemic therapy. \n \nIn these studies, patients were randomised to either placebo or tildrakizumab (including 200 mg and \n100 mg at 0, 4 and every twelve weeks thereafter [Q12W]), up to 52 or 64 weeks. In the active comparator \nstudy (reSURFACE 2), patients were also randomised to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for \n12 weeks, and weekly thereafter up to 28 weeks.  \n \nOverall demographic and baseline characteristics in reSURFACE1 and reSURFACE2 studies were \nconsistent across individual trials. Patients were 18 to 82 years old, with a mean age of 45.9. The median \nbaseline PASI score ranged from 17.7 to 18.4 across treatment groups. Baseline PGA score was marked or \nsevere in 33.4% of patients. Of all patients, 35.8% had received prior phototherapy, 41.1% had received \nprior conventional systemic therapy, 16.7% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of plaque \npsoriasis. A total of 15.4% of study patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis. Mean baseline \nDermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ranged from 13.0 to 14.8. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nStudies reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2 assessed the changes from baseline at Week 12 in the two co-\nprimary endpoints: 1) PASI 75 and 2) PGA of “0” (cleared) or “1” (minimal), with at least a 2-point \nimprovement from baseline. Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of patients who achieved \nPASI 90, PASI 100, the proportion of patients with DLQI 0 or 1, and maintenance of efficacy up to \n52/64  weeks.  \n \nResults obtained at weeks 12, 28 and beyond (up to week 64 in reSURFACE 1 and up to week 52 in \nreSURFACE 2) are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.  \n \nTable 2.

Improvements were maintained over \ntime with at week 52, 63.7% (100 mg) and 73.3% (200 mg) in reSURFACE 1, and 68.8% (100 mg) and \n72.4% (200 mg) in reSURFACE 2 of patients who were PASI 75 responders at week 28 having a DLQI of \n0 or 1.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilumetri \nin one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe subcutaneous formulation of tildrakizumab showed an absolute bioavailability ranging from 73% \n(90% CI: 46% - 115%, 200 mg SC vs. 3 mg/kg IV) to 80% (90% CI: 62% - 103%, 50 mg SC vs. \n0.5 mg/kg IV) in healthy subjects, as a result of cross study single dose comparison. Maximum \nconcentration was reached at 6.2 days after injection. Population PK analysis indicated a 31% higher \nbioavailability in healthy subjects compared to patients. \n \nAt steady state, following administration of 100 mg of tildrakizumab in subjects with moderate to severe \nplaque psoriasis geometric means (% CV) of AUC0-τ and Cmax values were respectively 305 μg·day/mL \n(41%) and 8.1 μg/mL (34%), whereas they were 612 μg·day/mL (40%) and 16.3 μg/mL (33%) following \nadministration of 200 mg.  \n \nDistribution \n \nTildrakizumab has limited extravascular distribution with volume of distribution (Vd) values ranging from \n76.9 to 106 mL/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTildrakizumab is catabolized into component amino acids by general protein degradation processes. \nSmall-molecule metabolic pathways (e.g., CYP450 enzymes, glucuronosyltransferases) do not contribute \nto its clearance. \n \nElimination \n \nClearance values range from 2.04 to 2.52 mL/day/kg and the half-life was 23.4 days (23% CV) in subjects \nwith plaque psoriasis.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nTildrakizumab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in subjects with plaque psoriasis over a dose \nrange from 50 mg to 400 mg following subcutaneous administration, with clearance being independent of \ndose. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSteady-state is achieved by 16 weeks with the clinical regimen of 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, with \n1.1-fold accumulation in exposure between week-1 and week-12 independent of dose. \n \nBody weight \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that exposure decreased as body weight increased. The \ngeometric mean exposure (AUC0-τ at steady state) in adult patients weighing >90 kg following a 100 mg \nor 200 mg SC dose was predicted to be about 30% lower than in an adult patient weighing ≤90 kg (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age did not have a clinically significant influence on \nthe clearance of tildrakizumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following administration of 100 mg \nor 200 mg of tildrakizumab, subjects who are 65 years or older (n=81 and n=82, respectively) had a \nsimilar tildrakizumab clearance as compared to subjects less than 65 years old (n=884). \n \nRenal and Hepatic impairment \nNo formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tildrakizumab was \nconducted. Tildrakizumab is catabolized into component amino acids by general protein degradation \nprocesses and is not eliminated by renal or hepatic pathways.  \n \nDrug interactions \n \nResults from a drug-drug interaction study conducted in plaque psoriasis subjects suggest that \ntildrakizumab had no clinically relevant effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. \nTherefore, tildrakizumab does not impact the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicines metabolized by \nCYP enzyme (see section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, and repeated dose toxicity. \n \nAnimal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tildrakizumab. Studies in mouse tumor \nmodels showed that selective inhibition of IL-23p19 does not increase carcinogenic risk. \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys, there was negligible secretion of the product into breast milk. One month after \nbirth, the milk/serum ratio was ≤0.002. Tildrakizumab was shown to distribute across the placental barrier. \nAfter repeated dosing to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, serum concentrations were quantifiable in the \nfetus, but the reproduction toxicity studies did not reveal any untoward effects. \n \nNo effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs, menstrual cycle length, and/or hormones \nwere observed in male and female cynomolgus monkeys that were administered tildrakizumab at doses \nresulting in >100 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC. \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in monkeys, no related increase in pregnancy loss was \nobserved at exposures up to 85 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. No harmful effects \nwere noted in neonates at maternal exposures up to 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. \nTwo neonatal deaths from monkeys administered tildrakizumab at maternal exposure of 85 times the \nhuman exposure at the recommended dose were attributed to possible viral infection and considered of \nuncertain relationship to the treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nIlumetri 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \ntildrakizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.  \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ilumetri is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Ilumetri \n3. How to use Ilumetri \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ilumetri \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ilumetri is and what it is used for \n \nIlumetri contains the active substance tildrakizumab. Tildrakizumab belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled interleukin (IL) inhibitors. \nThis medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, a substance found in the body \nwhich is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses and which is present at increased levels \nin diseases such as psoriasis. \n \nIlumetri is used to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease.  \nUsing Ilumetri will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Ilumetri \n \nDo not use Ilumetri: \n\n- If you are allergic to tildrakizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- If you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important, for example, active tuberculosis \nwhich is an infectious disease affecting mainly the lungs. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ilumetri: \n\n- If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, swelling of \nthe face, lips or throat do not inject more Ilumetri and contact your doctor immediately. \n\n- If you currently have an infection or if you have long-term or repeated infections. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n- If you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination.  \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using \nIlumetri. \n \nLook out for infections and allergic reactions \nIlumetri can potentially cause serious side effects, including infections and allergic reactions. You must \nlook out for signs of these conditions while you are taking Ilumetri. \nStop using Ilumetri and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs \nindicating a possible serious infection or an allergic reaction (see 4. Possible side effects).  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIlumetri is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it \nhas not yet been evaluated in this group of patients. \n \nOther medicines and Ilumetri  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThese include vaccines and immunosuppressants (medicines that affect the immune system). \n \nYou should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) while using Ilumetri. No data are \navailable with the concomitant use of Ilumetri and live vaccines. \n \nPregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility \nIt is preferable to avoid the use of Ilumetri in pregnancy. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women \nare not known. \n \nIf you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use an \neffective method of contraception whilst having treatment with Ilumetri and for at least 17 weeks after \ntreatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nIlumetri has no or little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3.

Keep the instructions for use and refer to them as needed. \n\n• The pre-filled syringes must not be shaken. \n• Read the Ilumetri Package Leaflet to learn more about your medicine. \n\n \nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION \n\nThis is what Ilumetri pre-filled syringe looks like: \n\n \n \n\n \nPREPARATION \n \n1. Take a pack from the refrigerator (if stored in the refrigerator)  \n\n• Take a carton pack out of the refrigerator and place the original and unopened carton pack on a \nclean and flat working surface.  \n\n \n2. Wait for 30 minutes (if stored in the refrigerator) \n\n• Leave the pre-filled syringe in the Ilumetri carton (with the lid closed) and let it sit at \nroom temperature for 30 minutes. \n\n \n3. Inspect the medicine \n\n• Remove the pre-filled syringe from the carton when ready to inject.  \n- Check the expiration date on the carton and pre-filled syringe and discard if the date has \n\npassed.  \n- DO NOT pull off the needle cover until you are ready to inject.  \n\n• Inspect Ilumetri visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  \n- Ilumetri is a clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow solution.  \n- DO NOT use if the liquid contains visible particles or the syringe is damaged. Air \n\nbubbles may be present; there is no need to remove them. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Collect all the materials you need \n\n• On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the: \n- alcohol wipes \n- cotton ball or gauze pad \n\n\n\n32 \n\n- sticking plaster \n- sharps disposal container \n\n \n5. Wash your hands \n\n• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n \n6. Choose an injection site \n\n• Choose an injection site with clear skin and easy access such as abdomen, thighs or upper arm.  \n- DO NOT administer 5 cm around the navel or where the skin is tender, bruised, abnormally \n\nred, hardened or affected by psoriasis.  \n- DO NOT inject into scars, stretch marks, or blood vessels.  \n- The upper arm is only suitable when someone else is injecting you. \n- Choose a different location for the second injection. \n\n \n7. Clean injection site \n\n• Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe and allow the skin to dry. \no Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nINJECTION \n\nIn case your dose is 200 mg, you will need to use 2 pre-filled syringes each time you administer the \nproduct.  \n \n8. Pull off the needle cover \n\n• While holding the body of the pre-filled syringe, remove the needle cover as shown and discard. \nYou may see 1 or 2 drops of liquid and that is okay. \n\no DO NOT touch the blue plunger yet. \no DO NOT use if pre-filled syringe or needle is bent. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n \n9. Pinch skin & insert needle \n\n• Gently pinch your skin at the chosen injection site. \n• Insert the entire needle into the pinched skin between your fingers, straight up and down at a \n\n90-degree angle. \no DO NOT place your finger on the plunger while inserting the needle. \n\n• Hold the pre-filled syringe steady. \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n \n10. Inject \n\n• After inserting the needle, let go of the skin gently. \n• Press down the blue plunger until it can go no further. This activates the safety mechanism that \n\nwill ensure full retraction of the needle after the injection is given.  \no A complete dose is administered if the blue plunger cannot go any further, and there are \n\nno spills. \n\n     \n \n\n11. Remove the used syringe \n\n• Remove the needle from the skin entirely before letting go of the blue plunger.  \no After the blue plunger is released, the safely lock will draw the needle inside the needle \n\nguard. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n\n• Dispose of used syringe in a sharps disposal container right away after use and before injecting \na second syringe. \n\n• If there is some residual fluid or a tiny bit of blood, clean the injection site with a cotton ball or \ngauze pad WITHOUT applying any pressure. If you feel the need, you can use a sticky plaster \nto cover the injection site. \n\n• Repeat the procedure with the second syringe in a different location of your skin if you are \nadministering a dose of 200 mg. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS \n\tA.
