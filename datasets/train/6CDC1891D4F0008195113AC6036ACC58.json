CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) \n \nAdempas is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III with \n\uf0b7 inoperable CTEPH,  \n\uf0b7 persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, \n to improve exercise capacity (see section 5.1).  \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \n \nAdempas, as monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists, is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO Functional Class \n(FC) II to III to improve exercise capacity. \nEfficacy has been shown in a PAH population including aetiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH or \nPAH associated with connective tissue disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nCTEPH or PAH. \n \nPosology \n \nDose titration \nThe recommended starting dose is 1 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Tablets should be taken three \ntimes daily approximately 6 to 8 hours apart (see section 5.2). \n \nDose should be increased by 0.5 mg three times daily every two weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg three \ntimes daily, if systolic blood pressure is \u226595 mmHg and the patient has no signs or symptoms of \nhypotension. In some PAH patients, an adequate response on the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) \nmay be reached at a dose of 1.5 mg three times a day (see section 5.1). If systolic blood pressure falls \nbelow 95 mmHg, the dose should be maintained provided the patient does not show any signs or \nsymptoms of hypotension. If at any time during the up-titration phase systolic blood pressure \ndecreases below 95 mmHg and the patient shows signs or symptoms of hypotension the current dose \nshould be decreased by 0.5 mg three times daily. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe established individual dose should be maintained unless signs and symptoms of hypotension \noccur. The maximum total daily dose is 7.5 mg i.e., 2.5 mg 3 times daily. If a dose is missed, treatment \nshould be continued with the next dose as planned. \nIf not tolerated, dose reduction should be considered at any time. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nFood \nTablets can generally be taken with or without food. For patients prone to hypotension, as a \nprecautionary measure, switches between fed and fasted Adempas intake are not recommended \nbecause of increased peak plasma levels of riociguat in the fasting compared to the fed state (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nTreatment discontinuation \nIn case treatment has to be interrupted for 3 days or more, treatment should be restarted with 1 mg \nthree times daily for 2 weeks, and continued with the dose titration regimen as described above. \n \nTransitioning between phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors and riociguat \nSildenafil must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to administration of riociguat. \nTadalafil must be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to administration of riociguat. \nRiociguat must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to administration of a PDE5 inhibitor. \nIt is recommended to monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after any transition (see \nsections 4.3, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIndividual dose titration at treatment initiation allows adjustment of the dose to the patient\u00b4s needs. \n \nElderly \nIn elderly patients (65 years or older) there is a higher risk of hypotension and therefore particular care \nshould be exercised during individual dose titration (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) have not been studied and therefore use of \nAdempas is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). Patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child Pugh B) showed a higher exposure to this medicinal product (see section 5.2). \nParticular care should be exercised during individual dose titration.  \n \nRenal impairment \nData in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) are limited and there \nare no data for patients on dialysis. Therefore use of Adempas is not recommended in these patients \n(see section 4.4). \nPatients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <80 - 30 mL/min) showed a \nhigher exposure to this medicinal product (see section 5.2). There is a higher risk of hypotension in \npatients with renal impairment, therefore particular care should be exercised during individual dose \ntitration. \n \nPatients on stable doses of strong multi pathway CYP / P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors  \nWhen initiating Adempas in patients on stable doses of strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP \ninhibitors, such as azole antimycotics (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole,  itraconazole) or HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg, three times a day to mitigate the risk of \nhypotension. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment. \nConsider a dose reduction for patients on Adempas doses higher than or equal to 1.0 mg if the \npatient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of riociguat in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No clinical data are available. Non-clinical data show undesirable effects on growing bone \n(see section 5.3). Until more is known about the implications of these findings the use of riociguat in \nchildren and in growing adolescents should be avoided. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSmokers \nCurrent smokers should be advised to stop smoking due to a risk of a lower response. Plasma \nconcentrations of riociguat in smokers are reduced compared to non-smokers. A dose increase to the \nmaximum daily dose of 2.5 mg three times daily may be required in patients who are smoking or start \nsmoking during treatment (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \nA dose decrease may be required in patients who stop smoking. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nCrushed tablets \nFor patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Adempas tablets may be crushed and mixed \nwith water or soft foods, such as apple sauce, immediately prior to use and administered orally (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Co-administration with PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n- Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Pregnancy (see sections  4.4; 4.5 and 4.6). \n- Co-administration with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form \n\nincluding recreational drugs called \u2018poppers\u2019 (see section 4.5). \n- Patients with systolic blood pressure < 95 mm Hg at treatment initiation. \n- Patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-\n\nIIP) (see section 5.1)  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn pulmonary arterial hypertension, studies with riociguat have been mainly performed in forms \nrelated to idiopathic or heritable PAH and PAH associated with connective tissue disease. The use of \nriociguat in other forms of PAH not studied is not recommended (see section 5.1). \nIn chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of \nchoice as it is a potentially curative option. According to standard medical practice, expert assessment \nof operability should be done prior to treatment with riociguat. \n \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease \n \nPulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary \nveno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of riociguat to such patients is not \nrecommended. Should signs of pulmonary oedema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should \nbe considered and treatment with riociguat should be discontinued. \n \nRespiratory tract bleeding \n \nIn pulmonary hypertension patients there is increased likelihood for respiratory tract bleeding, \nparticularly among patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. A careful monitoring of patients taking \nanticoagulants according to common medical practice is recommended. \nThe risk of serious and fatal respiratory tract bleeding may be further increased under treatment with \nriociguat, especially in the presence of risk factors, such as recent episodes of serious haemoptysis \nincluding those managed by bronchial arterial embolisation. Riociguat should be avoided in patients \nwith a history of serious haemoptysis or who have previously undergone bronchial arterial \nembolisation. In case of respiratory tract bleeding, the prescriber should regularly assess the benefit-\nrisk of treatment continuation. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSerious bleeding occurred in 2.4% (12/490) of patients taking riociguat compared to 0/214 of placebo \npatients. Serious haemoptysis occurred in 1% (5/490) patients taking riociguat compared to 0/214 \npatients taking placebo, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious haemorrhagic events also \nincluded 2 patients with vaginal haemorrhage, 2 with catheter site haemorrhage, and 1 each with \nsubdural haematoma, haematemesis, and intra-abdominal haemorrhage. \n \nHypotension \n \nRiociguat has vasodilatory properties which may result in lowering of blood pressure. Before \nprescribing riociguat, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying \nconditions, could be adversely affected by vasodilatory effects (e.g. patients on antihypertensive \ntherapy or with resting hypotension, hypovolaemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction or \nautonomic dysfunction). \nRiociguat must not be used in patients with a systolic blood pressure below 95 mmHg (see \nsection 4.3). Patients older than 65 years are at increased risk of hypotension. Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised when administering riociguat in these patients.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nData in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are limited and there \nare no data for patients on dialysis, therefore riociguat is not recommended in these patients. Patients \nwith mild and moderate renal impairment were included in the pivotal studies. There is increased \nriociguat exposure in these patients (see section 5.2). There is a higher risk of hypotension in these \npatients, particular care should be exercised during individual dose titration.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C); riociguat is \ncontraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). PK data show that higher riociguat exposure was \nobserved in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) (see section 5.2). Particular \ncare should be exercised during individual dose titration.  \n \nThere is no clinical experience with riociguat in patients with elevated liver aminotransferases \n(> 3 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)) or with elevated direct bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) prior to initiation \nof treatment; riociguat is not recommended in these patients. \n \nPregnancy/contraception \n \nAdempas is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Therefore, female patients at potential \nrisk of pregnancy must use an effective method of contraception. Monthly pregnancy tests are \nrecommended. \n \nSmokers \n \nPlasma concentrations of riociguat in smokers are reduced compared to non-smokers. Dose adjustment \nmay be necessary in patients who start or stop smoking during treatment with riociguat (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \n \n\uf0b7 The concomitant use of riociguat with strong multi pathway cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) / breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors such as azole \nantimycotics (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. \nritonavir) results in a pronounced increase in riociguat exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\uf0b7 Assess the benefit-risk for each patient individually before prescribing Adempas in patients on \nstable doses of strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. To mitigate the risk of \nhypotension, consider dose reduction and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\uf0b7 In patients on stable doses of Adempas, the initiation of strong multi pathway CYP and \n\nP-gp/BCRP inhibitors is not recommended as no dosage recommendation can be given due to \nlimited data. Alternative treatments should be considered. \n\n \n\uf0b7 The concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP1A1 inhibitors, such as the tyrosine kinase \n\ninhibitor erlotinib, and strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) / breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \ninhibitors, such as the immuno-suppressive agent cyclosporine A, may increase riociguat \nexposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). These medicinal products should be used with caution. \nBlood pressure should be monitored and dose reduction of riociguat be considered. \n\n \nAdempas contains lactose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nAdempas contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nNitrates \nIn a clinical study the highest dose of Adempas (2.5 mg tablets three times daily) potentiated the blood \npressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) taken 4 and 8 hours after intake. \nTherefore co-administration of Adempas with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in \nany form, including recreational drugs called \u2018poppers\u2019, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors \nPreclinical studies in animal models showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when \nriociguat was combined with either sildenafil or vardenafil. With increased doses, over additive effects \non systemic blood pressure were observed in some cases. \nIn an exploratory interaction study in 7 patients with PAH on stable sildenafil treatment (20 mg three \ntimes daily) single doses of riociguat (0.5 mg and 1 mg sequentially) showed additive haemodynamic \neffects. Doses above 1 mg riociguat were not investigated in this study. \nA 12 week combination study in 18 patients with PAH on stable sildenafil treatment (20 mg three \ntimes daily) and riociguat (1.0 mg to 2.5 mg three times daily) compared to sildenafil alone was \nperformed. In the long term extension part of this study (non controlled) the concomitant use of \nsildenafil and riociguat resulted in a high rate of discontinuation, predominately due to hypotension. \nThere was no evidence of a favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. \nConcomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is \ncontraindicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \nRESPITE was a 24-week, uncontrolled study to investigate switching from PDE5 inhibitors to \nriociguat, in 61 adult PAH patients on stable PDE5 inhibitors. All patients were WHO Functional \nClass III and 82% received background therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA). For the \ntransition from PDE5 inhibitors to riociguat, median treatment-free time for sildenafil was 1 day and \nfor tadalafil 3 days. Overall, the safety profile observed in the study was comparable with that \nobserved in the pivotal trials, with no serious adverse events reported during the transition period. \nSix patients (10%) experienced at least one clinical worsening event, including 2 deaths unrelated to \n\n\n\n8 \n\nstudy drug. Changes from baseline suggested beneficial effects in selected patients, e.g. improvement \nin 6MWD (+31m), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels \n(-347 pg/mL) and WHO FC I/II/III/IV,% (2/52/46/0), cardiac index (+0.3 L/min/m2). \n \nWarfarin/phenprocoumon  \nConcomitant treatment of riociguat and warfarin did not alter prothrombin time induced by the \nanticoagulant. The concomitant use of riociguat with other cumarin-derivatives (e.g. phenprocoumon) \nis also not expected to alter prothrombin time. \nLack of pharmacokinetic interactions between riociguat and the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin was \ndemonstrated in vivo. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nRiociguat did not potentiate the bleeding time caused by acetyl-salicylic acid or affect the platelet \naggregation in humans. \n \nEffects of other substances on riociguat \n \nRiociguat is cleared mainly via cytochrome P450-mediated (CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2J2) \noxidative metabolism, direct biliary/faecal excretion of unchanged riociguat and renal excretion of \nunchanged riociguat via glomerular filtration.  \n \nConcomitant use with strong multi pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors  \n \nHighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) \n \nIn vitro, abacavir, rilpivirine, efavirenz, ritonavir, cobicistat and elvitegravir inhibited CYP1A1 and \nthe metabolism of riociguat in the order listed with abacavir as the strongest inhibitor. Cobicistat, \nritonavir, atazanavir and darunavir are additionally classified as CYP3A inhibitors. In addition, \nritonavir showed inhibition of P-gp. \n \nThe impact of  HAART (including different combinations of abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, \ndarunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, ritonavir, and \ntenofovir) on riociguat exposure was investigated in a dedicated study in HIV patients. Concomitant \nadministration of HAART combinations led to an increase in riociguat mean AUC of up to about \n160% and to an approximate 20% increase in mean Cmax. The safety profile observed in HIV patients \ntaking a single dose of 0.5 mg riociguat together with different combinations of HIV drugs used in \nHAART was generally comparable to other patient populations. \n \nTo mitigate the risk of hypotension when Adempas is initiated in patients on stable doses of strong \nmulti pathway CYP (especially CYP1A1 and CYP3A4) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, e.g. as contained \nin HAART, consider a reduced starting dose. It is recommended to monitor these patients for signs \nand symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.2 and  4.4). \n \nAntifungals \n \nIn vitro, ketoconazole, classified as a strong CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, has been \nshown to be a multi-pathway CYP and P-gp/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor for \nriociguat metabolism and excretion (see section 5.2). Concomitant administration of 400 mg once \ndaily ketoconazole led to a 150% (range up to 370%) increase in riociguat mean AUC and a 46% \nincrease in mean Cmax. Terminal half-life increased from 7.3 to 9.2 hours and total body clearance \ndecreased from 6.1 to 2.4 L/h. \n \nTo mitigate the risk of hypotension when Adempas is initiated in patients on stable doses of strong \nmulti pathway CYP (especially CYP1A1 and CYP3A4) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, e.g. ketoconazole, \nposaconazole or itraconazole consider a reduced starting dose. It is recommended to monitor these \npatients for signs and symptoms of hypotension (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nConcomitant use with other CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors  \n \nMedicinal products strongly inhibiting P-gp/BCRP such as the immuno-suppressive cyclosporine A, \nshould be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nInhibitors for the UDP-Glykosyltransferases (UGT) 1A1 and 1A9 may potentially increase the \nexposure of the riociguat metabolite M1, which is pharmacologically active (pharmacological \nactivity: 1/10th to 1/3rd of riociguat). For co-administration with these substances follow the \nrecommendation on dose titration (see section 4.2). \n \nFrom the recombinant CYP isoforms investigated in vitro CYP1A1 catalysed formation of riociguat\u2019s \nmain metabolite most effectively. The class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was identified as potent \ninhibitors of CYP1A1, with erlotinib and gefitinib exhibiting the highest inhibitory potency in vitro. \nTherefore, drug-drug interactions by inhibition of CYP1A1 could result in increased riociguat \nexposure, especially in smokers (see section 5.2). Strong CYP1A1 inhibitors should be used with \ncaution (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use with medicinal products  increasing gastric pH  \n \nRiociguat exhibits a reduced solubility at neutral pH vs. acidic medium. Co-treatment of medicinal \nproducts increasing the upper gastro intestinal pH may lead to lower oral bioavailability. \n \nCo-administration of the antacid aluminium hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide reduced riociguat mean \nAUC by 34% and mean Cmax by 56% (see section 4.2). Antacids should be taken at least 2 hours \nbefore, or 1 hour after riociguat. \n \nConcomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers \n \nBosentan, reported to be a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, led to a decrease of riociguat steady-state \nplasma concentrations in PAH patients by 27% (see sections 4.1 and 5.1). For co-administration with \nbosentan follow the recommendation on dose titration (see section 4.2). \n \nThe concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbitone or St. John\u2019s Wort) may also lead to decreased riociguat plasma concentration. For co-\nadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers follow the recommendation on dose titration (see section \n4.2). \n \nSmoking \n \nIn cigarette smokers riociguat exposure is reduced by 50-60% (see section 5.2). Therefore, patients are \nadvised to stop smoking (see section 4.2). \n \nEffects of riociguat on other substances \n \nRiociguat and its main metabolite are strong inhibitors of CYP1A1 in vitro. Therefore, clinically \nrelevant drug-drug interactions with co-treatment which are significantly cleared by \nCYP1A1-mediated biotransformation, such as erlotinib or granisetron cannot be ruled out. \n \nRiociguat and its main metabolite are not inhibitors or inducers of major CYP isoforms (including \nCYP 3A4) or transporters (e.g. P-gp/BCRP) in vitro at therapeutic plasma concentrations. \n \nPatients must not get pregnant during Adempas therapy (see section 4.3). Riociguat (2.5 mg three \ntimes per day) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the plasma levels of combined oral \ncontraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol when concomitantly administered to \nhealthy female subjects. Based  on this study and as riociguat is not an inducer of any of the relevant \n\n\n\n10 \n\nmetabolic enzymes, also no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with other hormonal \ncontraceptives. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with Adempas. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no data from the use of riociguat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity and placental transfer (see section 5.3). Therefore, Adempas is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3). Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nNo data on the use of riociguat in breast-feeding women are available. Data from animals indicate that \nriociguat is excreted into milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants \nAdempas should not be used during breast-feeding. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with this medicinal product. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies with riociguat in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a \nreproduction toxicity study in rats, decreased testes weights were seen, but there were no effects on \nfertility (see section 5.3). The relevance of this finding for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdempas has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported \nand may affect the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be aware of how \nthey react to this medicinal product, before driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Adempas has been evaluated in phase III studies of 681 patients with CTEPH and PAH \nreceiving at least one dose of riociguat (see section 5.1). \n \nMost of the adverse reactions are caused by relaxation of smooth muscle cells in vasculature or the \ngastrointestinal tract. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions, occurring in \u226510% of patients under Adempas \ntreatment (up to 2.5 mg three times daily), were headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, peripheral oedema, \nnausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.  \n \nSerious haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage, including cases with fatal outcome have been \nobserved in patients with CTEPH or PAH treated with Adempas (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe safety profile of Adempas in patients with CTEPH and PAH appeared to be similar, therefore \nadverse reactions identified from placebo controlled 12 and 16 weeks clinical studies are presented as \npooled frequency in the table listed below (see table 1). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions reported with Adempas are listed in the table below by MedDRA system organ \nclass and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported with Adempas in the phase III studies \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ Class \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and infestations  Gastroenteritis  \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n Anaemia (incl. respective \nlaboratory parameters) \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness, \nHeadache \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Palpitations  \nVascular disorders  Hypotension  \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Haemoptysis, \nEpistaxis, \nNasal congestion \n\nPulmonary \nhaemorrhage* \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Dyspepsia, \nDiarrhoea, \nNausea, \nVomiting \n\nGastritis, \nGastro-oesophageal reflux \ndisease, \nDysphagia, \nGastrointestinal and \nabdominal pains, \nConstipation,  \nAbdominal distension \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nOedema \nperipheral \n\n  \n\n* fatal pulmonary haemorrhage was reported in uncontrolled long term extension studies \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInadvertent overdosing with total daily doses of 9 to 25 mg riociguat between 2 to 32 days was \nreported. Adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses (see section 4.8). \n \nIn case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required.  \nIn case of pronounced hypotension, active cardiovascular support may be required.  \nBased on the high plasma protein binding riociguat is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihypertensives (antihypertensives for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension) \nATC code: C02KX05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRiociguat is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary \nsystem and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO). When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyses synthesis \nof the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intra-cellular cGMP plays an \nimportant role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and \ninflammation. \nPulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of NO and \ninsufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. \nRiociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitises sGC to endogenous NO by stabilising the NO-sGC \nbinding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC independently of NO. \nRiociguat restores the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRiociguat restores the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway resulting in a significant improvement of pulmonary \nvascular haemodynamics and an increase in exercise ability. \nThere is a direct relationship between riociguat plasma concentration and haemodynamic parameters \nsuch as systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy in patients with CTEPH \n \nA randomised, double-blind, multi-national, placebo controlled, phase III study (CHEST-1) was \nconducted in 261 adult patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension \n(CTEPH) (72%) or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA; 28%). \nDuring the first 8 weeks riociguat was titrated every 2-weeks based on the patient\u2019s systolic blood \npressure and signs or symptoms of hypotension to the optimal individual dose (range 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg \nthree times daily) which was then maintained for a further 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study \nwas the placebo adjusted change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at the last visit \n(week 16). \nAt the last visit, the increase in 6MWD in patients treated with riociguat was 46 m (95% confidence \ninterval (CI): 25 m to 67 m; p<0.0001), compared to placebo. Results were consistent in the main \nsub-groups evaluated (ITT analysis, see table 2). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 2: Effects of riociguat on 6MWD in CHEST-1 at last visit  \nEntire patient population Riociguat  \n\n(n=173) \nPlacebo \n(n=88) \n\nBaseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n342 \n[82] \n\n356 \n [75] \n\nMean change from baseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n39 \n[79] \n\n-6 \n[84] \n\nPlacebo-adjusted difference (m)  \n95% CI, [p-value] \n\n46 \n25 to 67 [<0.0001] \n\n \nFC III patient population \n\n \nRiociguat  \n(n=107) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=60) \n\nBaseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n326 \n[81] \n\n345 \n [73] \n\nMean change from baseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n38 \n[75] \n\n-17 \n[95] \n\nPlacebo-adjusted difference (m)  \n95% CI  \n\n56 \n29 to 83  \n\nFC II patient population \n \n\nRiociguat  \n(n=55) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=25) \n\nBaseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n387 \n[59] \n\n386 \n [64] \n\nMean change from baseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n45 \n[82] \n\n20 \n[51] \n\nPlacebo-adjusted difference (m)  \n95% CI \n\n25 \n-10 to 61 \n\n \n Inoperable patient population  \n\n \nRiociguat  \n(n=121) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=68) \n\nBaseline (m)  \n[SD] \n\n335 \n[83] \n\n351 \n[75] \n\nMean change from baseline (m)  \n[SD] \n\n44 \n[84] \n\n-8 \n[88] \n\nPlacebo-adjusted difference (m) \n95% CI \n\n54 \n29 to 79 \n\n Patient population with CTEPH \npost-PEA \n\nRiociguat  \n(n=52) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=20) \n\nBaseline (m)  \n[SD] \n\n360 \n[78] \n\n374 \n[72] \n\nMean change from baseline (m) \n[SD] \n\n27 \n[68] \n\n1.8 \n[73] \n\nPlacebo- adjusted difference (m) \n95% CI \n\n27 \n-10 to 63 \n\n \nImprovement in exercise capacity was accompanied by improvement in multiple clinically relevant \nsecondary endpoints.

In \nCHEST-2, all patients received an individualised riociguat dose up to 2.5 mg three times daily. \nThe mean change in 6MWD from baseline to week 12 (last observation until week 12) in CHEST-2 \n(28 weeks on-study for CHEST-1 + CHEST-2) was 57 m in the former 1.0\u20132.5 mg riociguat group \nand 43 m in the former placebo group. Improvements in 6MWD persisted at 2 years in CHEST-2. \nMean change from baseline for the overall population (N=237) was 57 m at 6 months (n=218), 51 m at \n9 months (n=219), 52 m at 12 months (n=209) and 48 m at 24 months (n=193). \n \nThe probability of survival at 1 year was 97%, at 2 years 93% and at 3 years 89%. Survival in patients \nof WHO functional class II at baseline at 1, 2 and 3 years was 97%, 94% and 90% respectively, and \nfor patients of WHO functional class III at baseline was 97%, 93% and 88% respectively. \n \nEfficacy in patients with PAH \n \nA randomised, double-blind, multi-national, placebo controlled, phase III study (PATENT-1) was \nconducted in 443 adult patients with PAH (riociguat individual dose titration up to 2.5 mg three times \ndaily: n=254, placebo: n=126, riociguat \u201ccapped\u201d dose titration (CT) up to 1.5 mg (exploratory dose \narm, no statistical testing performed; n=63)). Patients were either treatment-na\u00efve (50%) or pre-treated \nwith ERA (43%) or a prostacyclin analogue (inhaled (iloprost), oral (beraprost) or subcutaneous \n(treprostinil); 7%) and had been diagnosed with idiopathic or heritable PAH (63.4%), PAH associated \nwith connective tissue disease (25.1%) and congenital heart disease (7.9%). \nDuring the first 8 weeks riociguat was titrated every 2-weeks based on the patient\u2019s systolic blood \npressure and signs or symptoms of hypotension to the optimal individual dose (range 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg \n\n\n\n15 \n\nthree times daily), which was then maintained for a further 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study \nwas placebo-adjusted change from baseline in 6MWD at the last visit (week 12).  \n \nAt the last visit the increase in 6MWD with riociguat individual dose titration (IDT) was 36 m \n(95% CI: 20 m to 52 m; p\uf03c0.0001) compared to placebo. Treatment-na\u00efve patients (n=189) improved \nby 38 m, and pre-treated patients (n=191) by 36 m (ITT analysis, see table 4).

In PATENT-2, all patients received an individualised riociguat dose up to 2.5 mg \nthree times daily. The mean change in 6MWD from baseline to week 12 (last observation until \nweek 12) in PATENT-2 (24 weeks on-study for PATENT-1 + PATENT-2) was 52 m in the former \n1.0\u20132.5 mg riociguat group,45 m in the former placebo group and 52 m in the former 1.0\u20131.5 mg \nriociguat group. Improvements in 6MWD persisted at 2 years in PATENT-2. Mean change from \n\n\n\n18 \n\nbaseline for the overall population (N=396) was 53 m at 6 months (n=366), 52 m at 9 months (n=354), \n50 m at 12 months (n=351) and 46 m at 24 months (n=316). \n \nThe probability of survival at 1 year was 97%, at 2 years 93% and at 3 years 88%. Survival in patients \nof WHO functional class II at baseline at 1, 2 and 3 years was 98%, 96% and 93% respectively, and \nfor patients of WHO functional class III at baseline was 96%, 91% and 84% respectively. \n \nPatients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP)  \n \nA randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled phase II study (RISE-IIP) to evaluate the efficacy and \nsafety of riociguat in patients with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic \ninterstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP) was terminated early due to an increased risk of mortality and serious \nadverse events in patients treated with riociguat and a lack of efficacy. More patients taking riociguat \ndied (11% vs. 4%) and had serious adverse events (37% vs. 23%) during the main phase. In the long-\nterm extension, more patients who switched from the placebo group to riociguat (21%) died than those \nwho continued in the riociguat group (3%). \n \nRiociguat is therefore contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with \nidiopathic interstitial pneumonias (see section 4.3).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAdempas in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of pulmonary \nhypertension. \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of riociguat is high (94%). Riociguat is rapidly absorbed with maximum \nconcentrations (Cmax) appearing 1-1.5 hours after tablet intake. Intake with food reduced riociguat \nAUC slightly, Cmax was reduced by 35%. \n \nBioavailability (AUC and Cmax) is comparable for Adempas administered orally as a crushed tablet \nsuspended in apple sauce or in water compared to a whole tablet (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding in humans is high at approximately 95%, with serum albumin and \nalpha 1-acidic glycoprotein being the main binding components. The volume of distribution is \nmoderate with volume of distribution at steady state being approximately 30 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nN-demethylation, catalysed by CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP2J2 is the major \nbiotransformation pathway of riociguat leading to its major circulating active metabolite M-1 \n(pharmacological activity: 1/10th to 1/3rd of riociguat) which is further metabolised to the \npharmacologically inactive N-glucuronide. \nCYP1A1 catalyses the formation of riociguat\u2019s main metabolite in liver and lungs and is known to be \ninducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which, for example, are present in cigarette smoke. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nElimination  \n \nTotal riociguat (parent compound and metabolites) is excreted via both renal (33-45%) and \nbiliary/faecal routes (48-59%). Approximately 4-19% of the administered dose was excreted as \nunchanged riociguat via the kidneys. Approximately 9-44% of the administered dose was found as \nunchanged riociguat in faeces. \nBased on in vitro data riociguat and its main metabolite are substrates of the transporter proteins P-gp \n(P-glycoprotein) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein). With a systemic clearance of about \n3-6 L/h, riociguat can be classified as a low-clearance drug. Elimination half-life is about 7 hours in \nhealthy subjects and about 12 hours in patients. \n \nLinearity \n \nRiociguat pharmacokinetics are linear from 0.5 to 2.5 mg. Inter-individual variability (CV) of \nriociguat exposure (AUC) across all doses is approximately 60%. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nGender \nPharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant differences due to gender in the exposure to riociguat.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of riociguat in paediatric patients.  \n \nElderly population \nElderly patients (65 years or older) exhibited higher plasma concentrations than younger patients, with \nmean AUC values being approximately 40% higher in elderly, mainly due to reduced (apparent) total \nand renal clearance.  \n \nInter-ethnic differences \nPharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant inter-ethnic differences.  \n \nDifferent weight categories \nPharmacokinetic data reveal no relevant differences due to weight in the exposure to riociguat.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn cirrhotic patients (non-smokers) with mild hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A) \nriociguat mean AUC was increased by 35% compared to healthy controls, which is within normal \nintra-individual variability. In cirrhotic patients (non-smokers) with moderate hepatic impairment \n(classified as Child Pugh B), riociguat mean AUC was increased by 51% compared to healthy \ncontrols. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh C). \n \nPatients with ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 x ULN were not studied (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nOverall, mean dose- and weight- normalised exposure values for riociguat were higher in subjects with \nrenal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Corresponding values for the main \nmetabolite were higher in subjects with renal impairment compared to healthy subjects. In non-\nsmoking individuals with mild (creatinine clearance 80-50 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance \n<50-30 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment, riociguat plasma \nconcentrations (AUC) were increased by 53%, 139% or 54%, respectively.  \nData in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min are limited and there are no data for patients on \ndialysis. \nDue to the high plasma protein binding riociguat is not expected to be dialysable. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single dose toxicity, phototoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. \n \nEffects observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies were mainly due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic \nactivity of riociguat (haemodynamic and smooth muscle relaxing effects). \n \nIn growing, juvenile and adolescent rats, effects on bone formation were seen. In juvenile rats, the \nchanges consisted of thickening of trabecular bone and of hyperostosis and remodeling of metaphyseal \nand diaphyseal bone, whereas in adolescent rats an overall increase of bone mass was observed. No \nsuch effects were observed in adult rats. \n \nIn a fertility study in rats, decreased testes weights occurred at systemic exposure of about 7-fold of \nhuman exposure, whereas no effects on male and female fertility were seen. Moderate passage across \nthe placental barrier was observed. Developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits have shown \nreproductive toxicity of riociguat. In rats, an increased rate of cardiac malformation was observed as \nwell as a reduced gestation rate due to early resorption at maternal systemic exposure of about 7-fold \nof human exposure (2.5 mg three times daily). In rabbits, starting at systemic exposure of about 3-fold \nof human exposure (2.5 mg three times daily) abortion and foetal toxicity were seen. \n \n \n6.

What Adempas is and what it is used for \n \nAdempas contains the active substance riociguat. Riociguat is a type of medicine called a guanylate \ncyclase (sGC)-stimulator. It works by widening the pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that connect \nthe heart to the lungs), making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the lungs. Adempas can be \nused to treat adults with certain forms of pulmonary hypertension, a condition in which these blood \nvessels become narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood through them and leading to \nhigh blood pressure in the vessels. Because the heart must work harder than normal, people with \npulmonary hypertension feel tired, dizzy and short of breath. By widening the narrowed arteries, \nAdempas leads to an improvement in your ability to carry out physical activity. \n \nAdempas is used in either of two types of pulmonary hypertension: \n \n\uf0b7 chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). \n\nIn CTEPH, the blood vessels of the lung are blocked or narrowed with blood clots. Adempas \ncan be used for patients with CTEPH who cannot be operated on, or after surgery for patients in \nwhom increased blood pressure in the lungs remains or returns. \n\n\uf0b7 certain types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  \nIn PAH, the wall of the blood vessels of the lungs are thickened and the vessels become \nnarrowed. Adempas is only prescribed for certain forms of PAH, i.e. idiopathic PAH (the cause \nof PAH is unknown), heritable PAH and PAH caused by connective tissue disease. Your doctor \nwill check this. Adempas can be taken alone or together with certain other medicines used to \ntreat PAH. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Adempas \n \nDo not take Adempas: \n- if you are taking certain medicines called PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). \n\nThese are medicines used for the treatment of high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs \n(PAH) or erectile dysfunction. \n\n- if you have severe liver problems (severe hepatic impairment, Child Pugh C). \n- if you are allergic to riociguat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are pregnant. \n- if you are taking nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form, medicines \n\noften used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain or heart disease. This also includes \nrecreational drugs called poppers. \n\n- if you have low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg) before starting \nfirst treatment with this medicine. \n\n- if you have increased pressure in your pulmonary circulation associated with scarring of the \nlungs, of unknown cause (idiopathic pulmonary pneumonia).  \n\nIf any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor first and do not take Adempas. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Adempas if: \n- you have recently experienced serious bleeding from the lung, or if you have undergone \n\ntreatment to stop coughing up blood (bronchial arterial embolisation). \n- you take blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants) since this may cause bleeding from the \n\nlungs. Your doctor will regularly monitor you. \n- you feel short of breath during treatment with this medicine, this can be caused by a build-up \n\nof fluid in the lungs. Talk to your doctor if this happens. \n- you have any symptoms of low blood pressure (hypotension) such as dizziness, \n\nlightheadedness, or fainting or if you are taking medicines to lower your blood pressure or \nmedicines that cause an increase in urination or if you have problems with your heart or \ncirculation. Your doctor may decide to monitor your blood pressure. If you are older than \n65 years, you have an increased risk of developing low blood pressure. \n\n- you take medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, \nitraconazole) or medicines for the treatment of HIV infection (e.g. abacavir, atazanavir, \ncobicistat, darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, \nritonavir, and tenofovir). Your doctor will monitor your health status and should consider a \nreduced starting dose for Adempas.  \n\n- your kidneys do not work properly (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or if you are on \ndialysis as the use of this medicine is not recommended. \n\n- you have moderate liver problems (hepatic impairment, Child Pugh B). \n- you start or stop smoking during treatment with this medicine, because this may influence the \n\nlevel of riociguat in your blood. \n \nYou will receive Adempas only for special types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), see \nsection 1. There is no experience in the use of Adempas in other types of PAH. Use of Adempas in \nother types of PAH is therefore not recommended. Your doctor will check if Adempas is suitable for \nyou. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Adempas in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) should be avoided because \nefficacy and safety have not been established for this age group. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nOther medicines and Adempas \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, in particular, medicines used for: \n- high blood pressure or heart disease (such as nitrates and amyl nitrite) in any form, as you must \n\nnot take those medicines together with Adempas. \n- high blood pressure in the lung vessels (the pulmonary arteries), as you must not take certain \n\nmedicines (sildenafil and tadalafil) together with Adempas. Other medicines for high blood \npressure in the lung vessels (PAH), such as bosentan and iloprost, can be used with Adempas, \nbut you should still tell your doctor. \n\n- erectile dysfunction (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), as you must not take those \nmedicines together with Adempas. \n\n- fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or HIV infection (such as \nabacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, \nemtricitabine, rilpivirine or ritonavir)  because alternative treatment options may be \nconsidered. If you already take one of these medicines and start treatment with Adempas, \nyour doctor will monitor your health status and should consider a reduced starting dose for \nAdempas. \n\n- epilepsy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone). \n- depression (St. John\u2019s Wort). \n- preventing rejection of transplanted organs (ciclosporin). \n- joint and muscular pain (niflumic acid). \n- cancer (such as erlotinib, gefitinib). \n- stomach disease or heartburn (antacids such as aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide). \n\nThese antacid medicines should be taken at least two hours before or one hour after taking \nAdempas. \n\n- nausea, vomiting (feeling or being sick) (such as granisetron). \n \nSmoking \nIf you smoke, it is recommended that you stop, as smoking may reduce the effectiveness of these \ntablets. Please tell your doctor if you smoke or if you stop smoking during treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nDo not take Adempas during pregnancy. If there is a chance you could become pregnant, use reliable \nforms of contraception while you are taking these tablets. You are also advised to take monthly \npregnancy tests. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIf you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \ntaking this medicine because it might harm your baby. You should not breast-feed while taking this \nmedicine. Your doctor will decide with you if you either should stop breast-feeding or stop treatment \nwith Adempas. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAdempas has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It may cause side effects \nsuch as dizziness. You should be aware of the side effects of this medicine before driving or using \nmachines (see section 4). \n \nAdempas contains lactose \nIf you have been told by a doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nAdempas contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to take Adempas \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nTreatment should only be started and monitored by a doctor experienced in the treatment of CTEPH or \nPAH. During the first weeks of treatment your doctor will need to measure your blood pressure at \nregular intervals. Adempas is available in different strengths and by checking your blood pressure \nregularly at the beginning of your treatment, your doctor will ensure that you are taking the \nappropriate dose. \n \nCrushed tablets: \nIf you have difficulty swallowing the whole tablet, talk to your doctor about other ways to take \nAdempas. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or a soft food, such as apple sauce, \nimmediately before you take it. \n \nDose \nThe recommended starting dose is a 1-mg tablet taken 3 times a day for 2 weeks.  \nThe tablets should be taken 3 times a day, approximately 6 to 8 hours apart. They can generally be \ntaken with or without food.  \nHowever, if you are prone to having low blood pressure (hypotension), you should not switch from \ntaking Adempas with food to taking Adempas without food because it may affect how you react to this \nmedicine.  \n \nYour doctor will increase the dose every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg 3 times a day (maximum \ndaily dose of 7.5 mg) unless you experience any side effects or very low blood pressure. In this case, \nyour doctor will prescribe you Adempas at the highest dose you are comfortable on. For some patients \nlower doses three times a day might be sufficient, the optimal dose will be selected by your doctor.  \n \nSpecial considerations for patients with kidney or liver problems \nYou should tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems. Your dose may need to be adjusted. \nIf you have severe liver problems (Child Pugh C), do not take Adempas. \n \n65 years or older \nIf you are 65 years or older your doctor will take extra care in adjusting your dose of Adempas, \nbecause you may be at greater risk of low blood pressure. \n \nSpecial considerations for patients who smoke \nYou should tell your doctor if you start or stop smoking during treatment with this medicine. Your \ndose may be adjusted. \n \nIf you take more Adempas than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than you should and experience any side effects (see section 4), please \ncontact your doctor. If your blood pressure drops (which can make you feel dizzy) then you may need \nimmediate medical attention. \n \nIf you forget to take Adempas \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what adempas is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "adempas contains the active substance riociguat. riociguat is a type of medicine called a guanylate cyclase (sgc)-stimulator. it works by widening the pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that connect the heart to the lungs), making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the lungs. adempas can be used to treat adults with certain forms of pulmonary hypertension, a condition in which these blood vessels become narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood through them and leading to high blood pressure in the vessels. because the heart must work harder than normal, people with pulmonary hypertension feel tired, dizzy and short of breath. by widening the narrowed arteries, adempas leads to an improvement in your ability to carry out physical activity. adempas is used in either of two types of pulmonary hypertension: chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (cteph). in cteph, the blood vessels of the lung are blocked or narrowed with blood clots. adempas can be used for patients with cteph who cannot be operated on, or after surgery for patients in whom increased blood pressure in the lungs remains or returns. certain types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). in pah, the wall of the blood vessels of the lungs are thickened and the vessels become narrowed. adempas is only prescribed for certain forms of pah, i.e. idiopathic pah (the cause of pah is unknown), heritable pah and pah caused by connective tissue disease. your doctor will check this. adempas can be taken alone or together with certain other medicines used to treat pah.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "adempas", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

"Section_Content": "do not take adempas: - if you are taking certain medicines called pde5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). these are medicines used for the treatment of high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pah) or erectile dysfunction. - if you have severe liver problems (severe hepatic impairment, child pugh c). - if you are allergic to riociguat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you are pregnant. - if you are taking nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form, medicines often used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain or heart disease. this also includes recreational drugs called poppers. - if you have low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 95 mmhg) before starting first treatment with this medicine. - if you have increased pressure in your pulmonary circulation associated with scarring of the lungs, of unknown cause (idiopathic pulmonary pneumonia). if any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor first and do not take adempas. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking adempas if: - you have recently experienced serious bleeding from the lung, or if you have undergone treatment to stop coughing up blood (bronchial arterial embolisation). - you take blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants) since this may cause bleeding from the lungs. your doctor will regularly monitor you. - you feel short of breath during treatment with this medicine, this can be caused by a build-up of fluid in the lungs. talk to your doctor if this happens. - you have any symptoms of low blood pressure (hypotension) such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting or if you are taking medicines to lower your blood pressure or medicines that cause an increase in urination or if you have problems with your heart or circulation. your doctor may decide to monitor your blood pressure. if you are older than 65 years, you have an increased risk of developing low blood pressure. - you take medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or medicines for the treatment of hiv infection (e.g. abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, rilpivirine, ritonavir, and tenofovir). your doctor will monitor your health status and should consider a reduced starting dose for adempas. - your kidneys do not work properly (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or if you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine is not recommended. - you have moderate liver problems (hepatic impairment, child pugh b). - you start or stop smoking during treatment with this medicine, because this may influence the level of riociguat in your blood. you will receive adempas only for special types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah), see section 1. there is no experience in the use of adempas in other types of pah. use of adempas in other types of pah is therefore not recommended. your doctor will check if adempas is suitable for you. children and adolescents the use of adempas in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) should be avoided because efficacy and safety have not been established for this age group. other medicines and adempas tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, in particular, medicines used for: - high blood pressure or heart disease (such as nitrates and amyl nitrite) in any form, as you must not take those medicines together with adempas. - high blood pressure in the lung vessels (the pulmonary arteries), as you must not take certain medicines (sildenafil and tadalafil) together with adempas. other medicines for high blood pressure in the lung vessels (pah), such as bosentan and iloprost, can be used with adempas, but you should still tell your doctor. - erectile dysfunction (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), as you must not take those medicines together with adempas. - fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) or hiv infection (such as abacavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, rilpivirine or ritonavir) because alternative treatment options may be considered. if you already take one of these medicines and start treatment with adempas, your doctor will monitor your health status and should consider a reduced starting dose for adempas. - epilepsy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone). - depression (st. john's wort). - preventing rejection of transplanted organs (ciclosporin). - joint and muscular pain (niflumic acid). - cancer (such as erlotinib, gefitinib). -

vomiting (feeling or being sick) (such as granisetron). smoking if you smoke, it is recommended that you stop, as smoking may reduce the effectiveness of these tablets. please tell your doctor if you smoke or if you stop smoking during treatment. pregnancy and breast-feeding pregnancy do not take adempas during pregnancy. if there is a chance you could become pregnant, use reliable forms of
