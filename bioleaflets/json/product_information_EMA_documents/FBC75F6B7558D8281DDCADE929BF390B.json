NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVantobra 170 mg nebuliser solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single-dose ampoule of 1.7 ml contains 170 mg tobramycin.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNebuliser solution. \n \nA clear to slightly yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVantobra is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in \npatients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF).  \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose of Vantobra is the same for all patients within the approved age range, regardless of age or weight. \nThe recommended dose is one ampoule (170 mg/1.7 ml) administered twice daily (i.e. total daily dose is 2 \nampoules) for 28 days. The dose interval should be as close as possible to 12 hours and not less than 6 hours.  \nVantobra is taken in alternating cycles of 28 days. A cycle of 28 days of active therapy (on-treatment period) \nand 28 days of rest from treatment (off-treatment period) should be maintained. \n \nMissed doses \nIn case of a missed dose with at least 6 hours remaining until the next dose, the patient should inhale the dose \nas soon as possible. If less than 6 hours remain to the next planned dose, the patient should wait for the next \ndose and not inhale more to make up for the missed dose. \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment should be continued on a cyclical basis for as long as the physician considers the patient is gaining \nclinical benefit from the treatment taking into account that long-term safety data are not available for \nVantobra. If clinical deterioration of pulmonary status is evident, additional or alternative anti-pseudomonal \ntherapy should be considered. See also information on clinical benefit and tolerability in sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.1. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years) \nThere are insufficient data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nRenal impairment \nThere are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment with \nVantobra. Please also refer to nephrotoxicity information in section 4.4 and excretion information in section \n5.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been performed on patients with hepatic impairment. As tobramycin is not metabolised, an \neffect of hepatic impairment on the exposure to tobramycin is not expected. \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \nAdequate data do not exist for the use of inhaled tobramycin in patients after organ transplantation. No \nrecommendation for or against dose adjustment can be made for patients after organ transplantation. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Vantobra in children below 6 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nInhalation use. \n \nVantobra is administered by inhalation using the Tolero nebuliser handset provided in the pack. For detailed \ninstructions on use see section 6.6. \n \nVantobra must not be administered by any other route or using any other device than the one provided in the \npack. The use of an alternative untested nebuliser system may alter the pulmonary deposition of the active \nsubstance. And this in turn may alter efficacy and safety of the product. \n \nWhere patients are receiving several inhaled medicinal products and chest physiotherapy, it is recommended \nthat Vantobra is used last.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOtotoxicity \n \nOtotoxicity, manifested as both auditory toxicity (hearing loss) and vestibular toxicity, has been reported \nwith parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. \nTinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution.  \n \nAuditory toxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, was observed \nwith parenteral aminoglycosides and may be considered also for the inhalation route of administration. In \nopen label studies and post-marketing experience, some patients with a history of prolonged previous or \nconcomitant use of intravenous aminoglycosides have experienced hearing loss. Physicians should consider \nthe potential for aminoglycosides to cause vestibular and cochlear toxicity and carry out appropriate \nassessments of auditory function during Vantobra therapy.  \n \nIn patients with a predisposing risk due to previous prolonged systemic aminoglycoside therapy it may be \nnecessary to consider audiological assessment before initiating Vantobra therapy. If a patient reports tinnitus \nor hearing loss during aminoglycoside therapy, the physician should consider referring them for audiological \nassessment. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nNephrotoxicity has been associated with parenteral aminoglycoside therapy. There was no evidence of \nnephrotoxicity during clinical trials with inhaled tobramycin and Vantobra. Caution should be exercised \nwhen prescribing Vantobra to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. According to current \nclinical practice baseline renal function should be assessed. Urea and creatinine levels should be reassessed \nafter every 6 complete cycles of Vantobra therapy (180 days of nebulised aminoglycoside therapy).  \n \nMonitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations \n \nPatients with known or suspected auditory or renal dysfunction should be monitored for serum tobramycin \nconcentrations. If oto- or nephrotoxicity occurs in a patient receiving Vantobra, tobramycin therapy should \nbe discontinued until serum concentration falls below 2 µg/ml. \n \nSerum concentrations greater than 12 µg/ml are associated with tobramycin toxicity and treatment should be \ndiscontinued if concentrations exceed this level. \n \nThe serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored using validated methods. Finger prick \nblood sampling is not recommended due to the risk of contamination of the sample. \n \nBronchospasm \n \nBronchospasm can occur with inhalation of medicinal products and has been reported with the use of \nnebulised tobramycin. Bronchospasm should be treated as medically appropriate. \n \nThe first dose of Vantobra should be used under supervision of a physician, after taking a bronchodilator if \nthis is part of the current regimen for the patient. FEV1 should be measured before and after nebulisation.  \n \nIf there is evidence of therapy-induced bronchospasm, the physician should carefully evaluate whether the \nbenefits of continued use of Vantobra outweighs the risks to the patient. If an allergic response is suspected, \nVantobra should be discontinued.  \n \nNeuromuscular disorders \n \nVantobra should be used with great caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinsonism or \nother conditions characterized by myasthenia, including myasthenia gravis, as aminoglycosides may \naggravate muscle weakness due to a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. \n \nHaemoptysis \n \nInhalation of nebulised tobramycin solutions may induce a cough reflex. The treatment with Vantobra in \npatients with active, severe haemoptysis should be initiated only if the benefits of treatment are considered to \noutweigh the risks of inducing further haemorrhage. \n \nDevelopment of resistance \n \nThe development of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa and superinfection with other pathogens represent \npotential risks associated with antibiotic therapy. Development of resistance during inhaled tobramycin \ntherapy could limit treatment options during acute exacerbations; this should be monitored. \n \nOther precautions \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPatients receiving concomitant parenteral aminoglycoside therapy (or any medicine affecting renal excretion, \nsuch as diuretics) should be monitored as clinically appropriate taking into account the risk of cumulative \ntoxicity. This includes monitoring of serum concentrations of tobramycin.  \n \nSafety and efficacy have not been studied in patients colonised with Burkholderia cepacia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Based on the interaction profile for tobramycin following \nintravenous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of Vantobra is not \nrecommended with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential, such as: \n- amphotericin B, cefalotin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, polymyxins (risk of increased nephrotoxicity); \n- platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity);   \n \nConcurrent use of Vantobra with diuretic compounds (such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea or mannitol) \nis not recommended. Such compounds can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic \nconcentrations in serum and tissue (see section 4.4). \n \nOther medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterally \nadministered aminoglycosides include: \n\n- anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects). \n \nIn clinical studies patients using inhaled tobramycin continued to take dornase alfa, bronchodilators, inhaled \ncorticosteroids and macrolides. No evidence of drug interactions with these medicines was identified. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the parenteral use of tobramycin in pregnant women. There are no adequate data \nfrom the use of tobramycin administered by inhalation in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate a \nteratogenic effect of tobramycin (see section 5.3). However, aminoglycosides can cause foetal harm (e.g., \ncongenital deafness and nephrotoxicity) when high systemic concentrations are achieved in a pregnant \nwoman. Systemic exposure following inhalation of Vantobra is very low (see section 5.2). If Vantobra is \nused during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Vantobra, she should be informed of \nthe potential hazard to the foetus.  \n \nVantobra should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the \nfoetus or baby. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nTobramycin is excreted in human breast milk after systemic administration. The amount of tobramycin \nexcreted in human breast milk after administration by inhalation is not known, though it is estimated to be \nvery low considering the low systemic exposure. Because of the potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity \nin infants, a decision should be made whether to terminate breast-feeding or discontinue treatment with \nVantobra, taking into account the importance of the treatment to the mother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo effect on male or female fertility was observed in animal studies after subcutaneous administration (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nVantobra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn controlled clinical trials with Vantobra the most frequent adverse reactions in cystic fibrosis patients with \nP. aeruginosa infection were cough and dysphonia. \n \nClinical experience with tobramycin nebuliser solutions reports dysphonia and tinnitus in patients treated \nwith tobramycin. The episodes of tinnitus were transient and resolved without discontinuation of tobramycin \ntherapy.  \nOccasionally, patients with a history of prolonged previous or concomitant use of intravenous \naminoglycosides may experience hearing loss. Parenteral aminoglycosides have been associated with \nhypersensitivity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nLong-term safety data are not available for Vantobra (see also section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions reported for tobramycin nebuliser solution are listed in Table 1. \nAdverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within each system organ \nclass, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the \ncorresponding frequency category is provided using the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); \nCommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); Very rare \n(< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency category Adverse Reactions \nInfections and infestations   \n Rare Laryngitis \n Very rare Fungal infection  \n\nOral candidiasis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \n Very rare Lymphadenopathy \nImmune system disorders   \n Very rare Hypersensitivity \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders   \n Rare Anorexia \nNervous system disorders   \n Rare \n\n \nDizziness \nAphonia \nHeadache \n\n Very rare Somnolence \nEar and labyrinth disorders   \n Rare \n\n \nHearing loss \nTinnitus \n\n Very rare \n \n\nEar pain  \nEar disorder \n\nVascular disorders \n \n\n  \n\n Rare Haemoptysis \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Epistaxis \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  \n\n Uncommon \n \n\nDyspnoea \nDysphonia \nPharyngitis  \nCough \n\n Rare Asthma \nLung disorder  \nChest discomfort \nProductive cough \nRhinitis \nBronchospasm \n\n Very rare Hypoxia \nHyperventilation \nSinusitis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   \n Rare \n\n \nVomiting \nMouth ulceration \nNausea \nDysgeusia \n\n Very rare \n \n\nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders   \n Rare Rash \n Very rare Urticaria \n\nPruritus \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  \n\n Very rare Back pain \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n  \n\n Rare Asthenia \nPyrexia \nPain \nChest pain \n\n Very rare Malaise \nInvestigations   \n Rare Pulmonary function \n\ntest decreased \n \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere was no difference in the safety profile between pediatric and adult patient population treated with \nVantobra. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nAdministration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Symptoms of aerosol \noverdose may include severe hoarseness. \n \nIn the event of accidental ingestion of Vantobra, toxicity is unlikely as tobramycin is poorly absorbed from \nan intact gastrointestinal tract. \n \nIn the event of inadvertent administration of Vantobra by the intravenous route, signs and symptoms of \nparenteral tobramycin overdose may occur, including dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of hearing acuity, \nrespiratory distress and/or neuromuscular blockage and renal impairment. \n \nAcute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of Vantobra and baseline tests of renal function \nshould be undertaken. Assessment of tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring \noverdose. In the case of any overdose, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in the elimination \nof Vantobra or other medicinal products should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, Aminoglycoside antibacterials.  \nATC code: J01GB01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius. It acts primarily by \ndisrupting protein synthesis leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell \nenvelope and eventual cell death. It is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than \ninhibitory concentrations. \n \nBreakpoints \nEstablished susceptibility breakpoints for parenteral administration of tobramycin are inappropriate in the \naerosolised administration of the medicinal product. Sputum of cystic fibrosis patients exhibits an inhibitory \naction on the local biological activity of nebulised aminoglycosides. This necessitates sputum concentrations \nfollowing treatment with aerosolised tobramycin to be ten to twentyfive-fold above the Minimum Inhibitory \nConcentration (MIC) for both P. aeruginosa growth suppression and control of bactericidal activity. In \ncontrolled clinical trials, 97% of patients receiving tobramycin nebuliser solution achieved sputum \nconcentrations 10-fold of the highest P. aeruginosa MIC cultured from the patient and 95% of patients \nreceiving tobramycin nebuliser solution achieved 25-fold of the highest MIC.  \n \nSusceptibility \nIn the absence of conventional susceptibility breakpoints for the nebulised route of administration, caution \nmust be exercised in defining organisms as susceptible or insusceptible to nebulised tobramycin. \n \nIn clinical studies with TOBI, most patients with P. aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs < 128 µg/ml \nat baseline showed improved lung function following treatment with TOBI. Patients with a P. aeruginosa \nisolate with MIC 128 µg/ml at baseline are less likely to show a clinical response. However, seven of 13 \npatients (54%) in the placebo-controlled trials who acquired isolates with MICs of 128 µg/ml while using \nTOBI had improvement in pulmonary function. \n \nBased upon in-vitro data and/or clinical trial experience, the organisms associated with pulmonary infections \nin CF may be expected to respond to Vantobra therapy as follows: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nHaemophilus influenzae \nStaphylococcus aureus \n\nInsusceptible Burkholderia cepacia \nStenotrophomonas maltophilia \nAlcaligenes xylosoxidans \n\n \nTreatment with the 28-days on and 28-days off dose regimen in clinical studies showed a small but clear \nincrease in tobramycin, amikacin and gentamicin MICs for P. aeruginosa isolates tested. Each additional 6 \nmonths of treatment resulted in incremental increases similar in magnitude to that observed in the 6 months \nof controlled studies. The most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance mechanism seen in P. aeruginosa \nisolated from chronically infected CF patients is impermeability, defined by a general lack of susceptibility to \nall aminoglycosides. P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients has also been shown to exhibit adaptive \naminoglycoside resistance that is characterised by a reversion to susceptibility when the antibiotic is \nremoved. \n \nOther information \nThere is no evidence that patients treated with up to 18 months with tobramycin nebuliser solution were at a \ngreater risk for acquiring B. cepacia, S. maltophilia or A. xylosoxidans, than would be expected in untreated \npatients. Aspergillus species were more frequently recovered from the sputum of treated patients; however, \nclinical sequelae such as Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) were reported rarely and with \nsimilar frequency as in the control group. \n \nAerosol characteristics \nTable 2: Comparative performance data for the clinical test and reference batches:  \nVantobra /Tolero nebuliser handset1, and TOBI/PARI LC PLUS2. \n\nPerformance parameter/ Drug/Device \ncombination* \n\nVantobra/Tolero  TOBI/PARI LC \nPLUS \n\nTotal Drug Delivered [mg±SD] 96 ± 4.4 101 ± 8.5  \nFine Particle Mass < 5 µm [mg±SD] 72 ± 6.5 65 ± 7.1 \nDrug Delivery Rate [mg/min] 27 ± 5.0 7 ± 0.9 \nMass Median Aerodynamic Diameter \n[µm ± SD] \n\n3.8 ± 0.3 3.6 ± 0.4 \n\nGeometric Standard Deviation ±SD 1.5 ± 0.0 2.3 ± 0.2 \nNebulisation Time [min] 3.9 ± 0.6  15.3 ± 0.6  \n*Results from breath simulation and cascade impactor measurements. \n1 connected with an eBase controller or eFlow rapid controller \n2 connected with a PARI Boy SX compressor \n \nThe drug delivery rate of Vantobra with the Tolero nebuliser is independent of the breathing pattern applied \ni.e. adult or child in contrast to the PARI LC PLUS nebuliser. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nLimited data from one controlled clinical study over one treatment cycle indicate that the improvement in \nlung function was maintained above baseline during the 28-day off-treatment period. \nAs a result of study 12012.101, lung function improvement FEV1% predicted relative to baseline increased \nby 8.2 ± 9.4% under Vantobra and by 4.8 ± 9.6% under the reference therapy in the first treatment cycle \nshowing non-inferior (p=0.0005) efficacy. CFU reduction as an indicator for suppression of P. aeruginosa \nwas comparable for Vantobra and the reference product. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nThe systemic exposure to tobramycin after inhalation of Vantobra is expected to emerge primarily from the \ninhaled portion of the medicinal product as tobramycin is not absorbed to any appreciable extent when \nadministered via the oral route. Inhalation of nebulised tobramycin produces high sputum concentrations and \nlow plasma levels.  \n \nFor comparative aerosol data please refer to Table 2 in section 5.1  \n \nAt the end of a 4-weeks dosing cycle of Vantobra (170 mg/1.7 ml twice daily) in cystic fibrosis patients, \nmaximum tobramycin plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 1.27 ± 0.81 µg/ml were reached at approximately \none hour after inhalation. Sputum concentrations were higher and more variable with Cmax of 1,951 + 2,187 \nµg/g. After administering a single dose of Vantobra 170 mg to healthy volunteers Cmax of 1.1 + 0.4 µg/ml \nwere reached after a tmax of approximately 4 hours. \n \nDistribution \n \nLess than 10% of tobramycin is bound to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTobramycin is not metabolised and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination of tobramycin administered by the inhalation route has not been studied. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 hours.  \n \nUnabsorbed tobramycin following administration by inhalation is probably eliminated primarily in \nexpectorated sputum. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal that the main hazard for humans, based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and \ndevelopment, consists of renal toxicity and ototoxicity. In repeated dose toxicity studies it has been shown \nthat target organs of toxicity are the kidneys and vestibular/cochlear functions. In general, toxicity is seen at \nhigher systemic tobramycin levels than are achievable by inhalation of the recommended clinical dose. \n \nNo reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with tobramycin administered by inhalation. \nSubcutaneous administration at doses of 100 mg/kg/day in rats and the maximum tolerated dose of 20 \nmg/kg/day in rabbits during organogenesis was not teratogenic. Teratogenicity could not be assessed at \nhigher parenteral doses in rabbits as they induced maternal toxicity and abortion. Based on available data \nfrom animals a risk of toxicity (e.g. ototoxicity) at prenatal exposure levels cannot be excluded. Tobramycin \ndid not impair fertility in male or female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nVantobra 170 mg nebuliser solution  \ntobramycin \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vantobra is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Vantobra \n3. How to use Vantobra \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Vantobra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vantobra is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Vantobra is \nVantobra contains an antibiotic medicine called tobramycin. It belongs to a class of antibiotic medicines \ncalled aminoglycosides. \n \nWhat Vantobra is used for \nVantobra is used in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6 years and older to treat lung infections caused by \nbacteria named Pseudomonas aeruginosa. \n \nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that frequently infects the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients at some \ntime during their lives. If the infection is not properly treated, it continues to damage the lungs, causing \nfurther problems with breathing. \n \nHow Vantobra works \nWhen you inhale Vantobra, the antibiotic can enter directly into your lungs to fight the bacteria causing the \ninfection. It works by disrupting the production of proteins that the bacteria need to build their cell walls. \nThis damages the bacteria and eventually kills them. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Vantobra \n \nDo not use Vantobra: \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tobramycin, to any type of aminoglycoside antibiotics, or to any \n\nof the other ingredients of Vantobra (listed in section 6). \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor if you have ever had any of the following conditions: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n• hearing problems (including noises in your ears and dizziness); \n• kidney problems; \n• chest tightness; \n• blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up); \n• muscle weakness that lasts or becomes worse over time, a symptom mostly related to conditions such \n\nas myasthenia (muscle weakness) or Parkinson’s disease. \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. \n \nIf you have problems with your hearing or kidney function, your doctor may take blood samples to monitor \nthe amount of Vantobra in your system. \n \nInhaling medicines can cause chest tightness due to narrowing of the airways, and this can happen with \nVantobra. Your doctor may ask you to use other appropriate medicines to widen the airways before using \nVantobra. \n \nStrains of Pseudomonas can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means that \nVantobra may not work as well as it should over time. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about this. \n \nIf you are also taking tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic by injection, it may increase the risk \nof side effects and your doctor will monitor for these as appropriate. \n \nChildren  \nThe medicine is not intended for use in children under 6 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Vantobra \nTell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou should not take the following medicines while you are using Vantobra: \n• furosemide, a diuretic (“water tablet”); \n• other medicines with diuretic potential such as urea or mannitol; \n• other medicines which may harm your kidneys or hearing:  \n\no amphotericin B, cefalotin, polymyxins (used to treat microbial infections), ciclosporin, \ntacrolimus (used to reduce the activity of immune system). These medicines may harm the \nkidneys;  \n\no platinum compounds such as carboplatin and cisplatin (used to treat some forms of cancer). \nThese medicines may harm the kidneys or hearing. \n\n \nThe following medicines can increase the risks of harmful effects occurring if they are given to you while \nyou also take tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic given by injection: \n• anticholinesterases such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine (used to treat muscle weakness), or \n\nbotulinum toxin. These medicines may cause muscle weakness to appear or become worse. \n \nIf you are taking one or more of the above medicines, talk to your doctor before you use Vantobra. \n \nYou should not mix or dilute Vantobra with any other medicine in your Tolero nebuliser handset which is \nprovided together with Vantobra. \nIf you are taking several different treatments for cystic fibrosis, you should take them in the following order: \n \n1. Bronchodilator therapy, such as salbutamol \n2. Chest physiotherapy \n3. Other inhaled medicines \n4. Vantobra \n\nPlease check this order with your doctor as well. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nIt is not known whether inhaling this medicine while you are pregnant causes side effects. When they are \ngiven by injection, tobramycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics can cause harm to an unborn child, such \nas deafness and kidney problems. \n \nIf you are breast feeding, you should talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVantobra is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Vantobra \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is two ampoules each day (one in the morning and one in the evening) for 28 days.  \n \n• The dose is the same for all persons aged 6 years and older. \n• Inhale by mouth the full content of one ampoule in the morning, and one ampoule in the evening using \n\nthe Tolero nebuliser handset. \n• It is best to have an interval as close as possible to 12 hours between doses, but this interval must be at \n\nleast 6 hours. \n• After you have used your medicine for 28 days, you then have a 28-day break, during which you do not \n\ninhale any Vantobra. You then start another course after the break (as illustrated). \n• It is important that you keep using the medicine twice each day during your 28 days on treatment, and \n\nthat you keep to the 28-day on / 28-day off cycle. \n \n \n\n \n \nON Vantobra  OFF Vantobra \nUse Vantobra twice a day for 28 days Do not use any Vantobra for the next 28 days \n \n \n           \n         Repeat cycle \n \nContinue using Vantobra on this cyclical basis for as long as your doctor tells you.  \nIf you have questions about how long to use Vantobra, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nPreparing Vantobra for inhalation \n \n\n•   Use Vantobra only with the Tolero nebuliser handset shown in the picture below to make sure you \ninhale the correct dose. Do not use the Tolero nebuliser handset for any other medicine.  \n\n•   Read the Instructions for Use provided with the handset device before use.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n• Make sure you have an eFlowrapid or eBase controller to connect the Tolero nebuliser handset. The \n\nrespective controller can be prescribed by your physician or purchased separately. \n• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n• Remove one ampoule of Vantobra from the aluminium foil sachet just before inhalation.  \n• Keep the rest of the medicine refrigerated in the original box. \n• Lay out all the pieces of your Tolero nebuliser handset on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. Make \n\nsure the nebuliser handset is on a flat, stable surface. \n• Assemble the Tolero nebuliser handset as illustrated in the Instructions for Use of the handset device. \n• Hold the ampoule upright and tap lightly before twisting off the head part to avoid spilling. Empty \n\nthe contents of one ampoule into the medication reservoir of the nebuliser handset. \n• Begin your treatment sitting in an upright position, in a well ventilated room. Hold the nebuliser \n\nhandset horizontally and breath normally through your mouth. Avoid breathing through your nose. \nContinue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished.
