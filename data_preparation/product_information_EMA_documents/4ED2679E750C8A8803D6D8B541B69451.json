NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZebinix 200 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite oblong tablets, engraved ’ESL 200’ on one side and scored on the other side, with a length of \n11 mm. The tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZebinix is indicated as: \n \n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; \n\n• adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with partial-onset \nseizures with or without secondary generalisation.  \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nZebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The recommended \nstarting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two \nweeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily. Some \npatients on monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nNo dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not \ndisturbed. Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is \nnot recommended for this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients, adult and children above 6 years of age, with \nrenal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance (CLCR) as follows: \n- CLCR >60 ml/min: no dose adjustment required. \n- CLCR 30-60 ml/min: initial dose of 200 mg (or 5 mg/kg in children above 6 years) once daily or \n\n400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years) every other day for 2 weeks followed by a once \ndaily dose of 400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years). However, based on individual \nresponse, the dose may be increased. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n- CLCR <30 ml/min: use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to \ninsufficient data. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) and use in these patients is, therefore, not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren above 6 years of age \nThe recommended starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day once daily. Dosage should be increased in weekly or \nbi-weekly increments of 10 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/kg/day, based on individual response. The \nmaximum dose is 1,200 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren with a body weight of ≥60 kg \nChildren with a body weight of 60 kg or more should be given the same dose as for adults. \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children aged 6 years and below has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nZebinix may be taken with or without food. \n \nSwitching preparations \nBased on comparative bioavailability data for the tablet and the suspension formulations, switching  \npatients from one formulation to the other can be done. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSecond or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic active \nsubstances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for eslicarbazepine acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored for \nsigns of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour emerge. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such \nas dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.  \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf Zebinix is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential \nof increased seizure frequency.  \n \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash developed as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of total population treated with Zebinix in clinical \nstudies in epileptic patients. Urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported in patients taking \nZebinix. Angioedema in the context of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction associated with \nlaryngeal oedema can be fatal. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, eslicarbazepine \nacetate must be discontinued immediately and alternative treatment should be initiated.  \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix \ntreatment. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nZebinix should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). If \nthe patients have developed such reactions, treatment with Zebinix must not be restarted in these \npatients at any time.  \n \nHLA-B* 1502 allele - in Han Chinese, Thai and other Asian populations \n \nHLA-B* 1502 in individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin has been shown to be strongly associated \nwith the risk of developing the severe cutaneous reactions known as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) \nwhen treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of eslicarbazepine acetate is similar to that \nof carbamazepine, and it is possible that patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 may also be at risk \nfor SJS after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. The prevalence of HLA-B*1502 carrier is about \n10% in Han Chinese and Thai populations. Whenever possible, these individuals should be screened \nfor this allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine or chemically-related active substances. If \npatients of these ethnic origins are tested positive for HLA- B*1502 allele, the use of eslicarbazepine \nacetate may be considered if the benefits are thought to exceed risks. \nBecause of the prevalence of this allele in other Asian populations (e.g, above 15% in the Philippines \nand Malaysia), testing genetically at risk populations for the presence of HLA- B*1502 may be \nconsidered. \n \nHLA-A*3101 allele- European descent and Japanese populations \n \nThere are some data that suggest HLA-A*3101 is associated with an increased risk of carbamazepine \ninduced cutaneous adverse drug reactions including SJS, TEN, Drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), \nor less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash in people \nof European descent and the Japanese. \nThe frequency of the HLA-A*3101 allele varies widely between ethnic populations. HLA-A*3101 \nallele has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in European populations and about 10% in Japanese population. \nThe presence of HLA-A*3101 allele may increase the risk for carbamazepine induced cutaneous \nreactions (mostly less severe) from 5.0% in general population to 26.0% among subjects of European \nancestry, whereas its absence may reduce the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. \nThere are insufficient data supporting a recommendation for HLA-A*3101 screening before starting \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds treatment. \nIf patients of European descent or Japanese origin are known to be positive for HLA-A*3101 allele, \nthe use of carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be considered if the benefits are \nthought to exceed risks. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.5% of patients treated with Zebinix. \nHyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms \n\n\n\n5 \n\nlike worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia \nincreased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease \nleading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may \nthemselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels \nshould be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum \nsodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium \nlevels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant \nhyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued. \n \nPR interval \n \nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac \nconduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated \nwith PR prolongation. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be \nadjusted according to creatinine clearance (see section 4.2). In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is \nnot recommended due to insufficient data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic \nand clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should \nbe used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, which is mainly eliminated by \nglucuronidation. In vitro eslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronyl \ntransferases. In vivo eslicarbazepine showed an inducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts that are mainly eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 (e.g. Simvastatin). Thus, an \nincrease in the dose of the medicinal products that are mainly metabolised through CYP3A4 may be \nrequired, when used concomitantly with eslicarbazepine acetate. Eslicarbazepine in vivo may have an \ninducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by conjugation \nthrough the UDP-glucuronyl transferases. When initiating or discontinuing treatment with Zebinix or \nchanging the dose, it may take 2 to 3 weeks to reach the new level of enzyme activity. This time delay \nmust be taken into account when Zebinix is being used just prior to or in combination with other \nmedicinal products that require dose adjustment when co-administered with Zebinix. Eslicarbazepine \nhas inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19. Thus, interactions can arise when co-administering \nhigh doses of eslicarbazepine acetate with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by \nCYP2C19 (e.g. Phenytoin). \n \nInteractions with other antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nCarbamazepine \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once \ndaily and carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average decrease of 32% in exposure to the \nactive metabolite eslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation. No change in \nexposure to carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-epoxide was noted. Based on individual \nresponse, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased if used concomitantly with \n\n\n\n6 \n\ncarbamazepine. Results from patient studies showed that concomitant treatment increased the risk of \nthe following adverse reactions: diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness. The risk of increase of \nother specific adverse reactions caused by co-administration of carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine \nacetate cannot be excluded. \n \nPhenytoin \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and phenytoin resulted in an average decrease of 31-33% in exposure to the active metabolite, \neslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation, and an average increase of \n31-35% in exposure to phenytoin, most likely caused by an inhibition of CYP2C19. Based on \nindividual response, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased and the dose of \nphenytoin may need to be decreased. \n \nLamotrigine \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for both eslicarbazepine and lamotrigine and, \ntherefore, an interaction could be expected. A study in healthy subjects with eslicarbazepine acetate \n1,200 mg once daily showed a minor average pharmacokinetic interaction (exposure of lamotrigine \ndecreased 15%) between eslicarbazepine acetate and lamotrigine and consequently no dose \nadjustments are required. However, due to inter-individual variability, the effect may be clinically \nrelevant in some individuals. \n \nTopiramate \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and topiramate showed no significant change in exposure to eslicarbazepine but an 18% decrease \nin exposure to topiramate, most likely caused by a reduced bioavailability of topiramate. No dose \nadjustment is required.  \n \nValproate and levetiracetam \nA population pharmacokinetics analysis of phase III studies in epileptic adult patients indicated that \nconcomitant administration with valproate or levetiracetam did not affect the exposure to \neslicarbazepine but this has not been verified by conventional interaction studies.  \n \nOxcarbazepine \nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may \ncause overexposure to the active metabolites. \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \nAdministration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily to female subjects using a combined \noral contraceptive showed an average decrease of 37% and 42% in systemic exposure to \nlevonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, respectively, most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4. \nTherefore, women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception during treatment with \nZebinix, and up to the end of the current menstruation cycle after the treatment has been discontinued \n(see section4.6). \n \nSimvastatin \nA study in healthy subjects showed an average decrease of 50% in systemic exposure to simvastatin \nwhen co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily, most likely caused by an \ninduction of CYP3A4. An increase of the simvastatin dose may be required when used concomitantly \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nRosuvastatin \nThere was an average decrease of 36-39% in systemic exposure in healthy subjects when \nco-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily. The mechanism for this reduction \nis unknown, but could be due to interference of transporter activity for rosuvastatin alone or in \n\n\n\n7 \n\ncombination with induction of its metabolism. Since the relationship between exposure and drug \nactivity is unclear, the monitoring of response to therapy (e.g., cholesterol levels) is recommended. \n \nWarfarin \nCo-administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily with warfarin showed a small \n(23%), but statistically significant decrease in exposure to S-warfarin. There was no effect on the R-\nwarfarin pharmacokinetics or on coagulation. However, due to inter-individual variability in the \ninteraction, special attention on monitoring of INR should be performed the first weeks after initiation \nor ending concomitant treatment of warfarin and eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nDigoxin \nA study in healthy subjects showed no effect of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily on \ndigoxin pharmacokinetics, suggesting that eslicarbazepine acetate has no effect on the transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nMonoamino Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) \nBased on a structural relationship of eslicarbazepine acetate to tricyclic antidepressants, an interaction \nbetween eslicarbazepine acetate and MAOIs is theoretically possible.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \n \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Most \nfrequently reported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defects. Multiple \nantiepileptic medicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital \nmalformations than monotherapy, therefore it is important that monotherapy is practised whenever \npossible. Specialist advice should be given to women who are likely to become pregnant or who are of \nchild-bearing potential. The need for antiepileptic therapy should be reviewed when a woman is \nplanning to become pregnant. No sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic therapy should be undertaken \nas this may lead to breakthrough seizures which could have serious consequences for both mother and \nchild. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, \neffective and safe method of contraception should be used during treatment and up to the end of the \ncurrent menstrual cycle after treatment has been stopped. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see Fertility). If women receiving eslicarbazepine acetate become \npregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of Zebinix should be carefully re-evaluated. Minimum \neffective doses should be given, and monotherapy whenever possible should be preferred at least \nduring the first three months of pregnancy. Patients should be counselled regarding the possibility of \nan increased risk of malformations and given the opportunity to antenatal screening. \n \nMonitoring and prevention \nAntiepileptic medicinal products may contribute to folic acid deficiency, a possible contributory cause \nof foetal abnormality. Folic acid supplementation is recommended before and during pregnancy. As \nthe efficacy of this supplementation is not proven, a specific antenatal diagnosis can be offered even \nfor women with a supplementary treatment of folic acid. \n \nIn the newborn child \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBleeding disorders in the newborn caused by antiepileptic medicinal products have been reported. As \na precaution, vitamin K1 should be administered as a preventive measure in the last few weeks of \npregnancy and to the newborn. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether eslicarbazepine acetate is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of eslicarbazepine in breast milk. As a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded breast-\nfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of eslicarbazepine acetate on human fertility. Studies in animals have \nshown impairment of fertility after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZebinix has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients might \nexperience dizziness, somnolence or visual disorders, particularly on initiation of treatment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised that their physical and/or mental abilities needed for operating machinery or \ndriving may be impaired and they are recommended not to do so until it has been established that their \nability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical studies (adjunctive therapy treatment and monotherapy), 2,434 patients with partial-onset \nseizures were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate (1,983 adult patients and 451 paediatric patients) \nand 51% of those patients experienced adverse reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity and occurred predominantly during the \nfirst weeks of treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nThe risks that have been identified for Zebinix are mainly class-based, dose-dependent undesirable \neffects. The most common adverse reactions reported, in placebo controlled adjunctive therapy studies \nwith adult epileptic patients and in an active controlled monotherapy study comparing eslicarbazepine \nacetate with carbamazepine controlled release, were dizziness, somnolence, headache, and nausea. The \nmajority of adverse reactions were reported in <3% of subjects in any treatment group. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with eslicarbazepine acetate obtained from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing surveillance are tabulated below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and not known (frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Treatment emergent adverse reactions associated with Zebinix obtained from  clinical studies \nand post-marketing surveillance \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  Hypothyroidism  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyponatraemia, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nElectrolyte \nimbalance, \ndehydration, \nhypochloraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Psychotic \ndisorder,  \napathy, \ndepression, \nnervousness, \nagitation, \nirritability, \nattention deficit/ \nhyperactivity \ndisorder, \nconfusional \nstate, mood \nswings, crying, \npsychomotor \nretardation, \nanxiety   \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nsomnolence \n \n\nHeadache, \ndisturbance in \nattention, \ntremor, ataxia, \nbalance disorder \n\nCoordination \nabnormal, \nmemory \nimpairment, \namnesia, \nhypersomnia, \nsedation, \naphasia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndystonia, \nlethargy, \nparosmia, \ncerebellar \nsyndrome, \nconvulsion, \nperipheral \nneuropathy, \nnystagmus, \nspeech disorder, \ndysarthria, \nburning \nsensation, \nparaesthesia, \nmigraine \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\nVisual \nimpairment, \noscillopsia, \nbinocular eye \nmovement \ndisorder, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo \n \n\nHypoacusis, \ntinnitus \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension \n(including \nhypertensive \ncrisis), \nhypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nflushing, \nperipheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Epistaxis, chest \npain \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nConstipation, \ndyspepsia, \ngastritis, \nabdominal pain, \ndry mouth, \nabdominal \ndiscomfort, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ngingivitis, \nmelaena, \ntoothache \n\nPancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver disorder  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \n \n\nAlopecia, dry \nskin, \nhyperhidrosis, \nerythema, skin \ndisorder, \npruritus, \ndermatitis \nallergic \n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome, \ndrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic symptoms \n(DRESS), \nangioedema, \nurticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, bone \nmetabolism \ndisorder, \nmuscular \nweakness, pain \nin extremity \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue, gait \ndisturbance, \nasthenia \n\nMalaise, chills, \noedema \nperipheral  \n\n \n\nInvestigations  Weight \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \ndecreased, \nweight \ndecreased, blood \npressure \nincreased, blood \nsodium \ndecreased, blood \nchloride \ndecreased, \nosteocalcin \nincreased, \nhaematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased, \ntransaminases \nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications  \n\n  Drug toxicity, \nfall, thermal \nburn  \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nEye and nervous system disorders \nIn patients concomitantly treated with carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate in placebo-\ncontrolled studies, the following adverse reactions were observed: diplopia (11.4% of subjects with \nconcomitant carbamazepine, 2.4% of subjects without concomitant carbamazepine), abnormal \ncoordination (6.7% with concomitant carbamazepine, 2.7% without concomitant carbamazepine), and \ndizziness (30.0% with concomitant carbamazepine, 11.5% without concomitant carbamazepine), see \nsection 4.5. \n \nPR interval \nThe use of eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \n \nClass related adverse reactions \nRare adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias did not occur during the placebo-controlled studies of \nthe epilepsy program with eslicarbazepine acetate. However, they have been reported with \noxcarbazepine. Therefore, their occurrence after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nThere have been reports of decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures in \npatients on long-term therapy with the structurally related antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and \noxcarbazepine. The mechanism by which bone metabolism is affected has not been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nIn placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged from 2 to 18 years with partial-onset seizures \n(238 patients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate and 189 with placebo), 35.7% of patients treated \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate and 19% of patients treated with placebo experienced adverse reactions. \nThe most common adverse reaction in the group treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia \n(5.0%), somnolence (8.0%) and vomiting (4.6%). \n \nThe adverse reaction profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is generally similar across age goups. In the age \ngroup from 6 to 11 years of age, the most common adverse reactions observed in more than two \npatients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia (9.5%), somnolence (7.4%), diziness \n(6.3%), convulsion (6.3%) and nausea (3.2%); in the age group from 12 to 18 years were somnolence \n(7.4%), vomiting (4.2%), diplopia (3.2%) and fatigue (3.2%). The safety of Zebinix in children aged 6 \nyears and below has not yet been established. \n \nThe safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was generally similar between adult and paediatric \npatients, except for agitation (common, 1.3%) and abdominal pain (common, 2.1%) which were more \ncommon in children than in adults. Dizziness; somnolence; vertigo; asthenia; gait disturbance; tremor; \nataxia; balance disorder; vision blurred; diarrhoea; rash and hyponatraemia were less common in \nchildren than in adults. Dermatitis allergic (uncommon, 0.8%) was reported only in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \nLong-term safety data in the paediatric population obtained from open label extensions of the phase III \nstudy was consistent with the known safety profile of the product with no new findings of concern. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms observed after an overdose of eslicarbazepine acetate are primarily associated with central \nnervous symptoms (e.g. seizures of all types, status epilepticus) and cardiac disorders (e.g. cardiac \narrhythmia). There is no known specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be \nadministered as appropriate. Eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites can effectively be cleared by \nhaemodialysis, if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives, ATC code: N03AF04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe precise mechanisms of action of eslicarbazepine acetate are unknown. However, in vitro \nelectrophysiological studies indicate that both eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites stabilise the \ninactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, precluding their return to the activated state and \nthereby preventing repetitive neuronal firing.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nEslicarbazepine acetate and its active metabolites prevented the development of seizures in nonclinical \nmodels predictive of anticonvulsant efficacy in man. In humans, the pharmacological activity of \neslicarbazepine acetate is primarily exerted through the active metabolite eslicarbazepine. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nAdult population \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy has been demonstrated in four phase III \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies in 1,703 randomized adult patients with partial epilepsy \nrefractory to treatment with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Oxcarbazepine \nand felbamate were not allowed as concomitant medicinal products in these studies. Eslicarbazepine \nacetate was tested at doses of 400 mg (in -301 and -302 studies only), 800 mg and 1,200 mg, once \ndaily. Eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 1,200 mg once daily were significantly more \neffective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency over a 12-week maintenance period. The \npercentage of subjects with ≥50% reduction (1581 analyzed) in seizure frequency in the phase III \nstudies was 19.3% for placebo, 20.8% for eslicarbazepine acetate 400 mg, 30.5% for eslicarbazepine \nacetate 800 mg and 35.3% for eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg daily.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy has been demonstrated in a double-blind, \nactive controlled (carbamazepine controlled release) study, involving 815 randomized adult patients \nwith newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at once-daily doses of \n800 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg. The doses of the active comparator, carbamazepine controlled \nrelease, were 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, twice-daily. All subjects were randomized to the lowest \ndose level and only if a seizure occurred subjects were to be escalated to the next dose level. From the \n815 randomized patients, 401 patients were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily [271 \npatients (67.6%) remained at dose of 800 mg, 70 patients (17.5%) remained at dose of 1,200 mg and \n60 patients (15.0%) were treated with 1,600 mg]. In the primary efficacy analysis, in which drop-outs \nwere considered as non-responders, 71.1% subjects were classified as seizure free in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group and 75.6% in the carbamazepine controlled release group during the \n26 week evaluation period (average risk difference -4.28%, 95% confidence interval: [-10,30; 1,74]. \nThe treatment effect observed during the 26-week evaluation period was maintained over 1 year of \ntreatment with 64.7 % eslicarbazepine acetate subjects and 70.3 % carbamazepine controlled release \nsubjects classified as seizure free (average risk difference -5.46%, 95% confidence interval: [-11.88; \n0.97]. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis and Cox regression), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk at the end of the evaluation \nperiod was 0.06 with carbamazepine and 0.12 with eslicarbazepine acetate and by the end of 1 year \nwith an additional increased risk to 0.11 with carbamazepine and 0.19 with eslicarbazepine acetate \n(p=0.0002). \n \nAt 1 year, the probability for subjects to withdraw due to either adverse reactions or lack of efficacy \nwas 0.26 for eslicarbazepine acetate and 0.21 for carbamazepine controlled release.  \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as conversion to monotherapy was evaluated in 2 double-blind, \nrandomized controlled studies in 365 adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate \nwas tested at doses of 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg once-daily. Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week \nmonotherapy period were 7.6% (1,600 mg) and 8.3 % (1,200 mg) in one study and 10.0% (1,600 mg) \nand 7.4 % (1,200 mg) in the other study, respectively. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly \npatients were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged \n≥ 65 years). The data shows that the incidence of adverse reactions in this population (65.3 %) is \nsimilar to the general population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies (66.8%). The most \nfrequent individual adverse reactions were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, \nconvulsion and hyponatraemia (8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72 subjects starting the study completed the 26-week treatment \nperiod that corresponds to a retention rate of 69.4% (see section 4.2 for information on elderly use). \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThere is limited data on monotherapy regimen available in the erldely population. Only a few subjects \n(N=27) aged above 65 years were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate in monotherapy study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in \nchildren was evaluated in one phase II study in children aged from 6 to 16 years (N=123) and one \nphase III study in children aged from 2 to 18 years (N=304). Both studies were double-blind and \nplacebo controlled with a duration of maintenance of 8 weeks (study 208) and 12 weeks (study 305), \nrespectively. Study 208 included 2 additional subsequent long-term, open-label extensions (1 year in \npart II and 2 years in part III) and Study 305 included 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension \nperiods (1 year in Parts II, III and IV and 2 years in Part V). Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at \ndoses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day. The target dose was 30 mg/kg/day \nin study 208 and 20 mg/kg/day in study 305. Doses could be adjusted based on tolerability and \ntreatment response. \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase II study, evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective. The \nleast square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance period \nwas significantly (p<0.001) higher with eslicarbazepine acetate (-34.8%) compared to placebo (-\n13.8%). Forty-two patients (50.6%) in the eslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 10 patients \n(25.0%) in the placebo group were responders (≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), \nresulting in a significant difference (p=0.009).  \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase III study, the least square mean reduction in standardised \nseizure frequency with eslicarbazepine acetate (-18.1% versus baseline) was different to placebo (-\n8.6% versus baseline) but not statistically significant (p=0.2490). Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) in the placebo group were responders \n(≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), resulting in a non-significant difference \n(p=0.9017). Post-hoc subgroup analyses for the phase III study were conducted by age strata and \nabove 6 years, as well as by dose. In children above 6 years, 36 patients (35.0%) in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to 29 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group were responders (p=0.4759) and \nthe least square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency was higher in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to placebo (-24.4% versus -10.5%); however, the difference of 13.9% was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.1040). A total of 39% patients in study 305 were up titrated to the \nmaximum possible dose (30 mg/kg/day). Amongst these, when excluding patients aged 6 years and \nyounger, 14 (48.3%) and 11 (30.6%) of patients in the eslicarbazepine acetate and placebo group, \nrespectively, were responders (p=0.1514). Although the robustness of these post-hoc subgroup \nanalyses is limited, the data suggest an age and dose dependent increase in effect size. \n \nIn the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (Part II) of the phase III study (ITT set N=225) the total \nresponder rate was 46.7% (steadily increasing from 44.9% (weeks 1-4) to 57.5% (weeks > 40)). The \ntotal median standardised seizure frequency was 6.1 (decreasing from 7.0 (weeks 1-4) to 4.0 (weeks > \n40), resulting in a median relative change compared to the baseline period of -46.7%). The median \nrelative change was larger in the previous placebo group (-51.4%) than in the previous ESL group (-\n40.4%). The proportion of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%) compared to the baseline \nperiod was 14.2%.  \n \nIn the subsequent 3 open-label extensions (ITT set N=148), the overall responder rate was 26.6% \nwhen compared to baseline Parts III–V (i.e. the last 4 weeks in part II). The total median standardised \nseizure frequency was 2.4 (resulting in a median relative change from Baseline Part III–V of -22.9%). \nThe overall median relative decrease in Part I was greater in patients treated with ESL (-25.8%) than \nin patients treated with placebo (-16.4%). The overall proportion of patients with exacerbation \n(increase of ≥25%) compared to Baseline Parts III–V was 25.7%.  \n \nOf the 183 patients who completed parts I and II of the study, 152 patients were enrolled into part III. \nOf these, 65 patients had received ESL and 87 patients had received placebo during the double-blind \npart of the study. 14 patients (9.2%) completed open-label treatment with ESL through Part V. The \nmost common reason for withdrawal during any part of the study was sponsor request (30 patients in \n\n\n\n15 \n\npart III [19.7% of the patients who entered part III], 9 in part IV [9.6% of the patients who entered part \nIV], and 43 in part V [64.2% of the patients who entered Part V]). \n \nTaking into consideration the limitations of open label uncontrolled data, the long-term response to \neslicarbazepine acetate in the open-label parts of the study was overall maintained. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZebinix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of epilepsy with partial \nonset seizures (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of eslicarbazepine \nacetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. Eslicarbazepine \nCmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Bioavailability may be assumed as high because the \namount of metabolites recovered in urine corresponded to more than 90% of an eslicarbazepine acetate \ndose.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe binding of eslicarbazepine to plasma proteins is relatively low (<40%) and independent from \nconcentration. In vitro studies have shown that plasma protein binding was not relevantly affected by \nthe presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide. The binding of warfarin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide was not significantly affected by the presence of \neslicarbazepine.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is rapidly and extensively biotransformed to its major active metabolite \neslicarbazepine by hydrolytic first-pass metabolism. The steady state plasma concentrations are \nattained after 4 to 5 days of once daily dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of \n20-24 hours. In studies in healthy subjects and epileptic adult patients, the apparent half-life of \neslicarbazepine was 10-20 hours and 13-20 hours, respectively. Minor metabolites in plasma are R-\nlicarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, which were shown to be active, and the glucuronic acid conjugates \nof eslicarbazepine acetate, eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine.  \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate does not affect its own metabolism or clearance. \n \nEslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and has inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19 \n(as stated in section 4.5). \n \nIn studies with eslicarbazepine in fresh human hepatocytes a mild induction of UGT1A1 mediated \nglucuronidation was observed. \n \nElimination \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion, in the unchanged and glucuronide conjugate forms. In total, eslicarbazepine and its \nglucuronide correspond to more than 90% of total metabolites excreted in urine, approximately two \nthirds in the unchanged form and one third as glucuronide conjugate. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate is linear and dose-proportional in the range \n400-1,200 mg both in healthy subjects and patients. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is unaffected in the elderly patients with \ncreatinine clearance >60 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion. A study in adult patients with mild to severe renal impairment showed that clearance is \ndependent on renal function. During treatment with Zebinix dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients, adult and children above 6 years of age with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see section \n4.2).  \nIn children from 2 to 6 years of age, the use of eslicarbazepine acetate is not recommended. At this age \nthe intrinsic activity of the elimination process has not yet reached maturation. \n \nHaemodialysis removes eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites from plasma.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eslicarbazepine acetate were evaluated in healthy subjects \nand moderately liver-impaired patients after multiple oral doses. Moderate hepatic impairment did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate. No dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients with mild to moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nGender \n \nStudies in healthy subjects and patients showed that pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate were \nnot affected by gender.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSimilar to adults, eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of \neslicarbazepine acetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. \nEslicarbazepine Cmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Body weight was shown to have an \neffect on volume of distribution and clearance. Furthermore, a role of age independently of weight \nwith regards to clearance of eslicarbazepine acetate could not be excluded, in particular for the \nyoungest age group (2-6 years). \n \nChildren aged 6 years and below \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that in the subgroup of children aged from 2 to 6 years, doses of \n27.5 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day are required in order to achieve exposures that are equivalent to the \ntherapeutic doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years of age. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that comparable eslicarbazepine exposure is observed between \n20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years old and adults with 800 and 1200 mg of \neslicarbazepine acetate once-daily, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies occurred at exposure levels appreciably lower than the \nclinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine (the principal and pharmacologically active metabolite of \neslicarbazepine acetate). Safety margins based on comparative exposure have thus not been \nestablished. \n \nEvidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in repeated dose-toxicity studies in the rat, but was not seen \nin studies in mice or dogs, and is consistent with an exacerbation of spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy in this species.  \n \nLiver centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats and an \nincreased incidence of liver tumours was observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice; these findings \nare consistent with an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been \nobserved in patients receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile dogs, the toxicity profile was comparable to that observed in adult \nanimals. In the 10-month study decreases in bone mineral content, bone area and/or bone mineral \ndensity in lumbar vertebrae and/or femur were observed in high-dose female animals at exposure \nlevels lower than the clinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine in children. \n \nGenotoxicity studies with eslicarbazepine acetate indicate no special hazards for humans. \n \nImpairment of fertility was observed in female rats; decreases in implantations and live embryos seen \nin the mouse fertility study may also indicate effects on female fertility, however, corpora lutea counts \nwere not evaluated. Eslicarbazepine acetate was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit, but did induce \nskeletal abnormalities in the mouse. Ossification delays, reduced foetal weights, an increase in minor \nskeletal and visceral anomalies were observed at maternal toxic doses in embryotoxicity studies in \nmice, rats and rabbits. A delay in the sexual development of the F1 generation was observed in \nperi/postnatal studies in mice and rats. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZebinix 400 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 400 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \n \nWhite circular biconvex tablets, engraved ‘ESL 400’on one side and scored on the other side, with a \ndiameter of 11 mm.. The scoreline is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and not to \ndivide into equal doses.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZebinix is indicated as: \n \n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; \n\n• adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with partial-onset \nseizures with or without secondary generalisation. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nZebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The recommended \nstarting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two \nweeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily Some patients \non monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nNo dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not \ndisturbed. Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is \nnot recommended for this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients, adult and children above 6 years of age, with \nrenal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance (CLCR) as follows: \n- CLCR >60 ml/min: no dose adjustment required. \n- CLCR 30-60 ml/min: initial dose of 200 mg (or 5 mg/kg in children above 6 years) once daily or \n\n400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years) every other day for 2 weeks followed by a once \n\n\n\n20 \n\ndaily dose of 400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years). However, based on individual \nresponse, the dose may be increased. \n\n- CLCR <30 ml/min: use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to \ninsufficient data. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) and use in these patients is, therefore, not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren above 6 years of age \nThe recommended starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day once daily. Dosage should be increased in weekly or \nbi-weekly increments of 10 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/kg/day, based on individual response. The \nmaximum dose is 1,200 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren with a body weight of ≥60 kg \nChildren with a body weight of 60 kg or more should be given the same dose as for adults. \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children aged 6 years and below has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nZebinix may be taken with or without food. \n \nSwitching preparations \nBased on comparative bioavailability data for the tablet and the suspension formulations, switching  \npatients from one formulation to the other can be done. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSecond or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic active \nsubstances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for eslicarbazepine acetate. Therefore patients should be monitored for \nsigns of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour emerge. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such \nas dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.  \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nOther warnings and precautions \n \nIf Zebinix is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential \nof increased seizure frequency.  \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash developed as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of total population treated with Zebinix in  clinical \nstudies in epileptic patients. Urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported in patients taking \nZebinix. Angioedema in the context of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction associated with \nlaryngeal oedema can be fatal. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, eslicarbazepine \nacetate must be discontinued immediately and alternative treatment should be initiated.  \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix \ntreatment. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nZebinix should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). If \nthe patients have developed such reactions, treatment with Zebinix must not be restarted in these \npatients at any time. \n \nHLA-B* 1502 allele - in Han Chinese, Thai and other Asian populations \n \nHLA-B* 1502 in individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin has been shown to be strongly associated \nwith the risk of developing the severe cutaneous reactions known as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) \nwhen treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of eslicarbazepine acetate is similar to that \nof carbamazepine, and it is possible that patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 may also be at risk \nfor SJS after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. The prevalence of HLA-B*1502 carrier is about \n10% in Han Chinese and Thai populations. Whenever possible, these individuals should be screened \nfor this allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine or chemically-related active substances. If \npatients of these ethnic origins are tested positive for HLA- B*1502 allele, the use of eslicarbazepine \nacetate may be considered if the benefits are thought to exceed risks. \nBecause of the prevalence of this allele in other Asian populations (e.g, above 15% in the Philippines \nand Malaysia), testing genetically at risk populations for the presence of HLA- B*1502 may be \nconsidered. \n \nHLA-A*3101 allele- European descent and Japanese populations \n \nThere are some data that suggest HLA-A*3101 is associated with an increased risk of carbamazepine \ninduced cutaneous adverse drug reactions including SJS, TEN, Drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), \nor less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash in people \nof European descent and the Japanese. \nThe frequency of the HLA-A*3101 allele varies widely between ethnic populations. HLA-A*3101 \nallele has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in European populations and about 10% in Japanese population. \nThe presence of HLA-A*3101 allele may increase the risk for carbamazepine induced cutaneous \nreactions (mostly less severe) from 5.0% in general population to 26.0% among subjects of European \nancestry, whereas its absence may reduce the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. \nThere are insufficient data supporting a recommendation for HLA-A*3101 screening before starting \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds treatment. \nIf patients of European descent or Japanese origin are known to be positive for HLA-A*3101 allele, \nthe use of carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be considered if the benefits are \nthought to exceed risks. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.5% of patients treated with Zebinix. \nHyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms \nlike worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia \nincreased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease \nleading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may \nthemselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels \nshould be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum \nsodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium \nlevels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant \nhyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued. \n \nPR interval \n \nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac \nconduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated \nwith PR prolongation. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be \nadjusted according to creatinine clearance (see section 4.2). In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is \nnot recommended due to insufficient data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic \nand clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should \nbe used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, which is mainly eliminated by \nglucuronidation. In vitro eslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronyl \ntransferases. In vivo eslicarbazepine showed an inducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts that are mainly eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 (e.g. Simvastatin). Thus, an \nincrease in the dose of the medicinal products that are mainly metabolised through CYP3A4 may be \nrequired, when used concomitantly with eslicarbazepine acetate. Eslicarbazepine in vivo may have an \ninducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by conjugation \nthrough the UDP-glucuronyl transferases.When initiating or discontinuing treatment with Zebinix or \nchanging the dose, it may take 2 to 3 weeks to reach the new level of enzyme activity. This time delay \nmust be taken into account when Zebinix is being used just prior to or in combination with other \nmedicinal products that require dose adjustment when co-administered with Zebinix. Eslicarbazepine \nhas inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19. Thus, interactions can arise when co-administering \nhigh doses of eslicarbazepine acetate with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by \nCYP2C19 (e.g. Phenytoin). \n \nInteractions with other antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nCarbamazepine \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once \ndaily and carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average decrease of 32% in exposure to the \nactive metabolite eslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation. No change in \n\n\n\n23 \n\nexposure to carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-epoxide was noted. Based on individual \nresponse, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased if used concomitantly with \ncarbamazepine. Results from patient studies showed that concomitant treatment increased the risk of \nthe following adverse reactions: diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness. The risk of increase of \nother specific adverse reactions caused by co-administration of carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine \nacetate cannot be excluded.  \n \nPhenytoin \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and phenytoin resulted in an average decrease of 31-33% in exposure to the active metabolite, \neslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation, and an average increase of \n31-35% in exposure to phenytoin, most likely caused by an inhibition of CYP2C19. Based on \nindividual response, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased and the dose of \nphenytoin may need to be decreased. \n \nLamotrigine \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for both eslicarbazepine and lamotrigine and \ntherefore, an interaction could be expected. A study in healthy subjects with eslicarbazepine acetate \n1,200 mg once daily showed a minor average pharmacokinetic interaction (exposure of lamotrigine \ndecreased 15%) between eslicarbazepine acetate and lamotrigine and consequently no dose \nadjustments are required. However, due to inter-individual variability, the effect may be clinically \nrelevant in some individuals. \n \nTopiramate \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and topiramate showed no significant change in exposure to eslicarbazepine but an 18% decrease \nin exposure to topiramate, most likely caused by a reduced bioavailability of topiramate. No dose \nadjustment is required.  \n \nValproate and levetiracetam \nA population pharmacokinetics analysis of phase III studies in epileptic adult patients indicated that \nconcomitant administration with valproate or levetiracetam did not affect the exposure to \neslicarbazepine but this has not been verified by conventional interaction studies.  \n \nOxcarbazepine \nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may \ncause overexposure to the active metabolites. \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \nAdministration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily to female subjects using a combined \noral contraceptive showed an average decrease of 37% and 42% in systemic exposure to \nlevonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, respectively, most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4. \nTherefore, women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception during treatment with \nZebinix, and up to the end of the current menstruation cycle after the treatment has been discontinued \n(see section 4.6). \n \nSimvastatin \nA study in healthy subjects showed an average decrease of 50% in systemic exposure to simvastatin \nwhen co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily, most likely caused by an \ninduction of CYP3A4. An increase of the simvastatin dose may be required when used concomitantly \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nRosuvastatin \n\n\n\n24 \n\nThere was an average decrease of 36-39% in systemic exposure in healthy subjects when \nco-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily. The mechanism for this reduction \nis unknown, but could be due to interference of transporter activity for rosuvastatin alone or in \ncombination with induction of its metabolism. Since the relationship between exposure and drug \nactivity is unclear, the monitoring of response to therapy (e.g., cholesterol levels) is recommended. \n \nWarfarin \nCo-administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily with warfarin showed a small \n(23%), but statistically significant decrease in exposure to S-warfarin. There was no effect on the R-\nwarfarin pharmacokinetics or on coagulation. However, due to inter-individual variability in the \ninteraction, special attention on monitoring of INR should be performed the first weeks after initiation \nor ending concomitant treatment of warfarin and eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nDigoxin \nA study in healthy subjects showed no effect of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily on \ndigoxin pharmacokinetics, suggesting that eslicarbazepine acetate has no effect on the transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nMonoamino Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) \nBased on a structural relationship of eslicarbazepine acetate to tricyclic antidepressants, an interaction \nbetween eslicarbazepine acetate and MAOIs is theoretically possible.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Most \nfrequently reported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defects. Multiple \nantiepileptic medicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital \nmalformations than monotherapy, therefore it is important that monotherapy is practised whenever \npossible. Specialist advice should be given to women who are likely to become pregnant or who are of \nchild-bearing potential. The need for antiepileptic therapy should be reviewed when a woman is \nplanning to become pregnant. No sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic therapy should be undertaken \nas this may lead to breakthrough seizures which could have serious consequences for both mother and \nchild. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \nEslicarbazepine acetate adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, \neffective and safe method of contraception should be used during treatment and up to the end of the \ncurrent menstrual cycle after treatment has been stopped. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see Fertility). If women receiving eslicarbazepine acetate become \npregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of Zebinix should be carefully re-evaluated. Minimum \neffective doses should be given, and monotherapy whenever possible should be preferred at least \nduring the first three months of pregnancy. Patients should be counselled regarding the possibility of \nan increased risk of malformations and given the opportunity to antenatal screening. \n \nMonitoring and prevention \nAntiepileptic medicinal products may contribute to folic acid deficiency, a possible contributory cause \nof foetal abnormality. Folic acid supplementation is recommended before and during pregnancy. As \nthe efficacy of this supplementation is not proven, a specific antenatal diagnosis can be offered even \nfor women with a supplementary treatment of folic acid. \n \nIn the newborn child \n\n\n\n25 \n\nBleeding disorders in the newborn caused by antiepileptic medicinal products have been reported. As \na precaution, vitamin K1 should be administered as a preventive measure in the last few weeks of \npregnancy and to the newborn. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether eslicarbazepine acetate is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of eslicarbazepine in breast milk. As a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded breast-\nfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nFertility  \nThere are no data on the effects of eslicarbazepine acetate on human fertility. Studies in animals have \nshown impairment of fertility after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZebinix has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients might \nexperience dizziness, somnolence or visual disorders, particularly on initiation of treatment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised that their physical and/or mental abilities needed for operating machinery or \ndriving may be impaired and they are recommended not to do so until it has been established that their \nability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical studies (adjunctive therapy treatment and monotherapy), 2,434 patients with partial-onset \nseizures were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate (1,983 adult patients and 451 paediatric patients) \nand 51% of those patients experienced adverse reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity and occurred predominantly during the \nfirst weeks of treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nThe risks that have been identified for Zebinix are mainly class-based, dose-dependent undesirable \neffects. The most common adverse reactions reported, in placebo controlled adjunctive therapy studies \nwith adult epileptic patients and in an active controlled monotherapy study comparing eslicarbazepine \nacetate with carbamazepine controlled release, were dizziness, somnolence, headache, and nausea. The \nmajority of adverse reactions were reported in <3% of subjects in any treatment group. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with eslicarbazepine acetate obtained from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing surveillance are tabulated below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and not known (frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Treatment emergent adverse reactions associated with Zebinix obtained  clinical studies and \npost-marketing surveillance \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\n\n\n26 \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  Hypothyroidism  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyponatraemia, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nElectrolyte \nimbalance, \ndehydration, \nhypochloraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Psychotic \ndisorder, apathy, \ndepression, \nnervousness, \nagitation, \nirritability, \nattention deficit/ \nhyperactivity \ndisorder, \nconfusional \nstate, mood \nswings, crying, \npsychomotor \nretardation, \nanxiety  \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nsomnolence \n \n\nHeadache, \ndisturbance in \nattention, \ntremor, ataxia, \nbalance disorder \n\nCoordination \nabnormal, \nmemory \nimpairment, \namnesia, \nhypersomnia, \nsedation, \naphasia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndystonia, \nlethargy, \nparosmia, \ncerebellar \nsyndrome, \nconvulsion, \nperipheral \nneuropathy, \nnystagmus, \nspeech disorder, \ndysarthria, \nburning \nsensation, \nparaesthesia, \nmigraine \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\nVisual \nimpairment, \noscillopsia, \nbinocular eye \nmovement \ndisorder, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo \n \n\nHypoacusis, \ntinnitus \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension \n(including \nhypertensis \ncrisis), \nhypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nflushing, \nperipheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Epistaxis, chest \npain \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nConstipation, \ndyspepsia, \ngastritis, \nabdominal pain, \ndry mouth, \nabdominal \ndiscomfort, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ngingivitis, \nmelaena, \ntoothache \n\nPancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver disorder  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \n \n\nAlopecia, dry \nskin, \nhyperhidrosis, \nerythema, skin \ndisorder, \npruritus, \ndermatitis \nallergic \n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome, \ndrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic symptoms \n(DRESS), \nangioedema, \nurticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, bone \nmetabolism \ndisorder, \nmuscular \nweakness, pain \nin extremity \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue, gait \ndisturbance, \nasthenia \n \n\nMalaise, chills, \noedema \nperipheral \n\n \n\nInvestigations  Weight \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \ndecreased, \nweight \ndecreased, blood \npressure \nincreased, blood \nsodium \ndecreased, blood \nchloride \ndecreased, \nosteocalcin \nincreased,   \nhaematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased, \ntransaminases \nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n  Drug toxicity, \nfall, thermal \nburn \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nEye and nervous system disorders \nIn patients concomitantly treated with carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate in placebo-\ncontrolled studies, the following adverse reactions were observed: diplopia (11.4% of subjects with \nconcomitant carbamazepine, 2.4% of subjects without concomitant carbamazepine), abnormal \ncoordination (6.7% with concomitant carbamazepine, 2.7% without concomitant carbamazepine), and \ndizziness (30.0% with concomitant carbamazepine, 11.5% without concomitant carbamazepine), see \nsection 4.5. \n \nPR interval \nThe use of eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \n \nClass related adverse reactions \nRare adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias did not occur during the placebo-controlled studies of \nthe epilepsy program with eslicarbazepine acetate. However, they have been reported with \noxcarbazepine. Therefore, their occurrence after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nThere have been reports of decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures in \npatients on long-term therapy with the structurally related antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and \noxcarbazepine. The mechanism by which bone metabolism is affected has not been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nIn placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged from 2 to 18 years with partial-onset seizures \n(238 patients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate and 189 with placebo), 35.7% of patients treated \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate and 19% of patients treated with placebo experienced adverse reactions. \nThe most common adverse reaction in the group treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia \n(5.0%), somnolence (8.0%) and vomiting (4.6%). \n \nThe adverse reaction profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is generally similar across age goups. In the age \ngroup from 6 to 11 years of age, the most common adverse reactions observed in more than two \npatients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia (9.5%), somnolence (7.4%), diziness \n(6.3%), convulsion (6.3%) and nausea (3.2%); in the age group from 12 to 18 years were somnolence \n(7.4%), vomiting (4.2%), diplopia (3.2%) and fatigue (3.2%). The safety of Zebinix in children aged 6 \nyears and below has not yet been established. \n \nThe safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was generally similar between adult and paediatric \npatients, except for agitation (common, 1.3%) and abdominal pain (common, 2.1%) which were more \ncommon in children than in adults. Dizziness; somnolence; vertigo; asthenia; gait disturbance; tremor; \nataxia; balance disorder; vision blurred; diarrhoea; rash and hyponatraemia were less common in \nchildren than in adults. Dermatitis allergic (uncommon, 0.8%) was reported only in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \nLong-term safety data in the paediatric population obtained from open label extensions of the Phase III \nstudy was consistent with the known safety profile of the product with no new findings of concern. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms observed after an overdose of eslicarbazepine acetate are primarily associated with central \nnervous symptoms (e.g. seizures of all types, status epilepticus) and cardiac disorders (e.g. cardiac \narrhythmia). There is no known specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be \nadministered as appropriate. Eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites can effectively be cleared by \nhaemodialysis, if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives, ATC code: N03AF04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe precise mechanisms of action of eslicarbazepine acetate are unknown. However, in vitro \nelectrophysiological studies indicate that both eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites stabilise the \ninactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, precluding their return to the activated state and \nthereby preventing repetitive neuronal firing.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\nEslicarbazepine acetate and its active metabolites prevented the development of seizures in nonclinical \nmodels predictive of anticonvulsant efficacy in man. In humans, the pharmacological activity of \neslicarbazepine acetate is primarily exerted through the active metabolite eslicarbazepine. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nAdult population \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy has been demonstrated in four phase III \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies in 1,703 randomized adult patients with partial epilepsy \nrefractory to treatment with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Oxcarbazepine \nand felbamate were not allowed as concomitant medicinal products in these studies. Eslicarbazepine \nacetate was tested at doses of 400 mg (in -301 and -302 studies only), 800 mg and 1,200 mg, once \ndaily. Eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 1,200 mg once daily were significantly more \neffective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency over a 12-week maintenance period. The \npercentage of subjects with ≥50% reduction (1581 analyzed) in seizure frequency in the phase III \nstudies was 19.3% for placebo, 20.8% for eslicarbazepine acetate 400 mg, 30.5% for eslicarbazepine \nacetate 800 mg and 35.3% for eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg daily.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy has been demonstrated in a double-blind, \nactive controlled (carbamazepine controlled release) study, involving 815 randomized adult patients \nwith newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at once-daily doses of \n800 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg. The doses of the active comparator, carbamazepine controlled \nrelease, were 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, twice-daily. All subjects were randomized to the lowest \ndose level and only if a seizure occurred subjects were to be escalated to the next dose level. From the \n815 randomized patients, 401 patients were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily [271 \npatients (67.6%) remained at dose of 800 mg, 70 patients (17.5%) remained at dose of 1,200 mg and \n60 patients (15.0%) were treated with 1,600 mg]. In the primary efficacy analysis, in which drop-outs \nwere considered as non-responders, 71.1% subjects were classified as seizure free in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group and 75.6% in the carbamazepine controlled release group during the \n26 week evaluation period (average risk difference -4.28%, 95% confidence interval: [-10,30; 1,74]. \nThe treatment effect observed during the 26-week evaluation period was maintained over 1 year of \ntreatment with 64.7 % eslicarbazepine acetate subjects and 70.3 % carbamazepine controlled release \nsubjects classified as seizure free (average risk difference -5.46%, 95% confidence interval: [-11.88; \n0.97]. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis and Cox regression), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk at the end of the evaluation \nperiod was 0.06 with carbamazepine and 0.12 with eslicarbazepine acetate and by the end of 1 year \nwith an additional increased risk to 0.11 with carbamazepine and 0.19 with eslicarbazepine acetate \n(p=0.0002).  \n \nAt 1 year, the probability for subjects to withdraw due to either adverse reactions or lack of efficacy \nwas 0.26 for eslicarbazepine acetate and 0.21 for carbamazepine controlled release.  \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as conversion to monotherapy was evaluated in 2 double-blind, \nrandomized controlled studies in 365 adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate \nwas tested at doses of 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg once-daily. Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week \nmonotherapy period were 7.6% (1,600 mg) and 8.3 % (1,200 mg) in one study and 10.0% (1,600 mg) \nand 7.4 % (1,200 mg) in the other study, respectively. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly \npatients were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged \n≥ 65 years). The data shows that the incidence of adverse reactions in this population (65.3 %) is \nsimilar to the general population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies (66.8%). The most \nfrequent individual adverse reactions were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, \nconvulsion and hyponatraemia (8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72 subjects starting the study completed the 26-week treatment \nperiod that corresponds to a retention rate of 69.4% (see section 4.2 for information on elderly use). \n\n\n\n31 \n\nThere is limited data on monotherapy regimen available in the erldely population. Only a few subjects \n(N=27) aged above 65 years were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate in monotherapy study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in \nchildren was evaluated in one phase II study in children aged from 6 to 16 years (N=123) and one \nphase III study in children aged from 2 to 18 years (N=304). Both studies were double-blind and \nplacebo controlled with a duration of maintenance of 8 weeks (study 208) and 12 weeks (study 305), \nrespectively. Study 208 included 2 additional subsequent long-term, open-label extensions (1 year in \npart II and 2 years in part III) and Study 305 included 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension \nperiods (1 year in Parts II, III and IV and 2 years in Part V). Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at \ndoses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day. The target dose was 30 mg/kg/day \nin study 208 and 20 mg/kg/day in study 305. Doses could be adjusted based on tolerability and \ntreatment response. \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase II study, evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective. The \nleast square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance period \nwas significantly (p<0.001)  higher with eslicarbazepine acetate (-34.8%) compared to placebo (-\n13.8%). Forty-two patients (50.6%) in the eslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 10 patients \n(25.0%) in the placebo group were responders (≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), \nresulting in a significant difference (p=0.009).  \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase III study, the least square mean reduction in standardised \nseizure frequency with eslicarbazepine acetate (-18.1% versus baseline) was different to placebo (-\n8.6% versus baseline) but not statistically significant (p=0.2490). Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) in the placebo group were responders \n(≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), resulting in a non-significant difference \n(p=0.9017). Post-hoc subgroup analyses for the phase III study were conducted by age strata and \nabove 6 years, as well as by dose. In children above 6 years, 36 patients (35.0%) in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to 29 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group were responders (p=0.4759) and \nthe least square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency was higher in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to placebo (-24.4% versus -10.5%); however, the difference of 13.9% was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.1040). A total of 39% patients in study 305 were up titrated to the \nmaximum possible dose (30 mg/kg/day). Amongst these, when excluding patients aged 6 years and \nyounger, 14 (48.3%) and 11 (30.6%) of patients in the eslicarbazepine acetate and placebo group, \nrespectively, were responders (p=0.1514). Although the robustness of these post-hoc subgroup \nanalyses is limited, the data suggest an age and dose dependent increase in effect size. \n \nIn the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (Part II) of the phase III study (ITT set N=225) the total \nresponder rate was 46.7% (steadily increasing from 44.9% (weeks 1-4) to 57.5% (weeks > 40)). The \ntotal median standardised seizure frequency was 6.1 (decreasing from 7.0 (weeks 1-4) to 4.0 (weeks > \n40), resulting in a median relative change compared to the baseline period of -46.7%). The median \nrelative change was larger in the previous placebo group (-51.4%) than in the previous ESL group (-\n40.4%). The proportion of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%) compared to the baseline \nperiod was 14.2%. \n \nIn the subsequent 3 open-label extensions (ITT set N=148), the overall responder rate was 26.6% \nwhen compared to baseline Parts III–V (i.e. the last 4 weeks in part II). The total median standardised \nseizure frequency was 2.4 (resulting in a median relative change from Baseline Part III–V of -22.9%). \nThe overall median relative decrease in Part I was greater in patients treated with ESL (-25.8%) than \nin patients treated with placebo (-16.4%). The overall proportion of patients with exacerbation \n(increase of ≥25%) compared to Baseline Parts III–V was 25.7%.   \n \nOf the 183 patients who completed parts I and II of the study, 152 patients were enrolled into part III. \nOf these, 65 patients had received ESL and 87 patients had received placebo during the double-blind \npart of the study. 14 patients (9.2%) completed open-label treatment with ESL through Part V. The \n\n\n\n32 \n\nmost common reason for withdrawal during any part of the study was sponsor request (30 patients in \npart III [19.7% of the patients who entered part III], 9 in part IV [9.6% of the patients who entered part \nIV], and 43 in part V [64.2% of the patients who entered Part V]). \n \nTaking into consideration the limitations of open label uncontrolled data, the long-term response to \neslicarbazepine acetate in the open-label parts of the study was overall maintained. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZebinix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of epilepsy with partial \nonset seizures (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of eslicarbazepine \nacetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. Eslicarbazepine \nCmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Bioavailability may be assumed as high because the \namount of metabolites recovered in urine corresponded to more than 90% of an eslicarbazepine acetate \ndose.  \n \nDistribution \nThe binding of eslicarbazepine to plasma proteins is relatively low (<40%) and independent from \nconcentration. In vitro studies have shown that plasma protein binding was not relevantly affected by \nthe presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide. The binding of warfarin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide was not significantly affected by the presence of \neslicarbazepine.  \n \nBiotransformation \nEslicarbazepine acetate is rapidly and extensively biotransformed to its major active metabolite \neslicarbazepine by hydrolytic first-pass metabolism. The steady state plasma concentrations are \nattained after 4 to 5 days of once daily dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of \n20-24 hours. In studies in healthy subjects and epileptic adult patients, the apparent half-life of \neslicarbazepine was 10-20 hours and 13-20 hours, respectively. Minor metabolites in plasma are R-\nlicarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, which were shown to be active, and the glucuronic acid conjugates \nof eslicarbazepine acetate, eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine.  \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate does not affect its own metabolism or clearance. \n \nEslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and has inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19 \n(as stated in section 4.5). \n \nIn studies with eslicarbazepine in fresh human hepatocytes a mild induction of UGT1A1 mediated \nglucuronidation was observed. \n \nElimination \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion, in the unchanged and glucuronide conjugate forms. In total, eslicarbazepine and its \nglucuronide correspond to more than 90% of total metabolites excreted in urine, approximately two \nthirds in the unchanged form and one third as glucuronide conjugate. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate is linear and dose-proportional in the range \n400-1,200 mg both in healthy subjects and patients. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is unaffected in the elderly patients with \ncreatinine clearance >60 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion. A study in adult patients with mild to severe renal impairment showed that clearance is \ndependent on renal function. During treatment with Zebinix dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients, adult and children above 6 years of age with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see section \n4.2).  \nIn children from 2 to 6 years of age, the use of eslicarbazepine acetate is not recommended. At this age \nthe intrinsic activity of the elimination process has not yet reached maturation. \n \nHaemodialysis removes eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites from plasma.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eslicarbazepine acetate were evaluated in healthy subjects \nand moderately liver-impaired patients after multiple oral doses. Moderate hepatic impairment did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate. No dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients with mild to moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nGender \nStudies in healthy subjects and patients showed that pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate were \nnot affected by gender.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSimilar to adults, eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of \neslicarbazepine acetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. \nEslicarbazepine Cmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Body weight was shown to have an \neffect on volume of distribution and clearance. Furthermore, a role of age independently of weight \nwith regards to clearance of eslicarbazepine acetate could not be excluded, in particular for the \nyoungest age group (2-6 years). \n \nChildren aged 6 years and below \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that in the subgroup of children aged from 2 to 6 years, doses of \n27.5 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day are required in order to achieve exposures that are equivalent to the \ntherapeutic doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years of age. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that comparable eslicarbazepine exposure is observed between \n20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years old and adults with 800 and 1200 mg of \neslicarbazepine acetate once-daily, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies occurred at exposure levels appreciably lower than the \nclinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine (the principal and pharmacologically active metabolite of \neslicarbazepine acetate). Safety margins based on comparative exposure have thus not been \nestablished. \n \nEvidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in repeated dose-toxicity studies in the rat, but was not seen \nin studies in mice or dogs, and is consistent with an exacerbation of spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy in this species.  \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nLiver centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats and an \nincreased incidence of liver tumours was observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice; these findings \nare consistent with an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been \nobserved in patients receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile dogs, the toxicity profile was comparable to that observed in adult \nanimals. In the 10-month study decreases in bone mineral content, bone area and/or bone mineral \ndensity in lumbar vertebrae and/or femur were observed in high-dose female animals at exposure \nlevels lower than the clinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine in children. \n \nGenotoxicity studies with eslicarbazepine acetate indicate no special hazards for humans.  \n \nImpairment of fertility was observed in female rats; decreases in implantations and live embryos seen \nin the mouse fertility study may also indicate effects on female fertility, however, corpora lutea counts \nwere not evaluated. Eslicarbazepine acetate was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit, but did induce \nskeletal abnormalities in the mouse. Ossification delays, reduced foetal weights, an increase in minor \nskeletal and visceral anomalies were observed at maternal toxic doses in embryotoxicity studies in \nmice, rats and rabbits. A delay in the sexual development of the F1 generation was observed in \nperi/postnatal studies in mice and rats. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZebinix is indicated as: \n \n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; \n\n• adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with partial-onset \nseizures with or without secondary generalisation. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nZebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The recommended \nstarting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two \nweeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily Some patients \non monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nNo dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not \ndisturbed. Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is \nnot recommended for this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients, adult and children above 6 years of age, with \nrenal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance (CLCR) as follows: \n- CLCR >60 ml/min: no dose adjustment required. \n- CLCR 30-60 ml/min: initial dose of 200 mg (or 5 mg/kg in children above 6 years) once daily or \n\n400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years) every other day for 2 weeks followed by a once \ndaily dose of 400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years). However, based on individual \nresponse, the dose may be increased. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n- CLCR <30 ml/min: use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to \ninsufficient data. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) and use in these patients is, therefore, not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren above 6 years of age \nThe recommended starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day once daily. Dosage should be increased in weekly or \nbi-weekly increments of 10 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/kg/day, based on individual response. The \nmaximum dose is 1,200 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren with a body weight of ≥60 kg \nChildren with a body weight of 60 kg or more should be given the same dose as for adults. \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children aged 6 years and below has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nZebinix may be taken with or without food. \n \nSwitching preparations \nBased on comparative bioavailability data for the tablet and the suspension formulations, switching  \npatients from one formulation to the other can be done. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSecond or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic active \nsubstances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for eslicarbazepine acetate. Therefore patients should be monitored for \nsigns of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour emerge. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such \nas dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.  \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nIf Zebinix is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential \nof increased seizure frequency.  \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash developed as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of total population treated with Zebinix in clinical \nstudies in epileptic patients. Urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported in patients taking \nZebinix. Angioedema in the context of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction associated with \nlaryngeal oedema can be fatal. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, eslicarbazepine \nacetate must be discontinued immediately and alternative treatment should be initiated.  \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix \ntreatment. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nZebinix should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). If \nthe patients have developed such reactions, treatment with Zebinix must not be restarted in these \npatients at any time. \n \nHLA-B* 1502 allele - in Han Chinese, Thai and other Asian populations \n \nHLA-B* 1502 in individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin has been shown to be strongly associated \nwith the risk of developing the severe cutaneous reactions known as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) \nwhen treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of eslicarbazepine acetate is similar to that \nof carbamazepine, and it is possible that patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 may also be at risk \nfor SJS after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. The prevalence of HLA-B*1502 carrier is about \n10% in Han Chinese and Thai populations. Whenever possible, these individuals should be screened \nfor this allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine or chemically-related active substances. If \npatients of these ethnic origins are tested positive for HLA- B*1502 allele, the use of eslicarbazepine \nacetate may be considered if the benefits are thought to exceed risks. \nBecause of the prevalence of this allele in other Asian populations (e.g, above 15% in the Philippines \nand Malaysia), testing genetically at risk populations for the presence of HLA- B*1502 may be \nconsidered. \n \nHLA-A*3101 allele- European descent and Japanese populations \n \nThere are some data that suggest HLA-A*3101 is associated with an increased risk of carbamazepine \ninduced cutaneous adverse drug reactions including SJS, TEN, Drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), \nor less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash in people \nof European descent and the Japanese. \nThe frequency of the HLA-A*3101 allele varies widely between ethnic populations. HLA-A*3101 \nallele has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in European populations and about 10% in Japanese population. \nThe presence of HLA-A*3101 allele may increase the risk for carbamazepine induced cutaneous \nreactions (mostly less severe) from 5.0% in general population to 26.0% among subjects of European \nancestry, whereas its absence may reduce the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. \nThere are insufficient data supporting a recommendation for HLA-A*3101 screening before starting \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds treatment. \nIf patients of European descent or Japanese origin are known to be positive for HLA-A*3101 allele, \nthe use of carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be considered if the benefits are \nthought to exceed risks. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.5% of patients treated with Zebinix. \nHyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms \nlike worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia \n\n\n\n39 \n\nincreased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease \nleading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may \nthemselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels \nshould be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum \nsodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium \nlevels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant \nhyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued. \n \nPR interval \n \nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac \nconduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated \nwith PR prolongation. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be \nadjusted according to creatinine clearance (see section 4.2). In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is \nnot recommended due to insufficient data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic \nand clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should \nbe used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, which is mainly eliminated by \nglucuronidation. In vitro eslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronyl \ntransferases. In vivo eslicarbazepine showed an inducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts that are mainly eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 (e.g. Simvastatin). Thus, an \nincrease in the dose of the medicinal products that are mainly metabolised through CYP3A4 may be \nrequired, when used concomitantly with eslicarbazepine acetate. Eslicarbazepine in vivo may have an \ninducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by conjugation \nthrough the UDP-glucuronyl transferases. When initiating or discontinuing treatment with Zebinix or \nchanging the dose, it may take 2 to 3 weeks to reach the new level of enzyme activity. This time delay \nmust be taken into account when Zebinix is being used just prior to or in combination with other \nmedicinal products that require dose adjustment when co-administered with Zebinix. Eslicarbazepine \nhas inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19. Thus, interactions can arise when co-administering \nhigh doses of eslicarbazepine acetate with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by \nCYP2C19 (e.g. Phenytoin). \n \nInteractions with other antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nCarbamazepine \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once \ndaily and carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average decrease of 32% in exposure to the \nactive metabolite eslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation. No change in \nexposure to carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-epoxide was noted. Based on individual \nresponse, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased if used concomitantly with \ncarbamazepine. Results from patient studies showed that concomitant treatment increased the risk of \n\n\n\n40 \n\nthe following adverse reactions: diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness. The risk of increase of \nother specific adverse reactions caused by co-administration of carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine \nacetate cannot be excluded. \n  \nPhenytoin \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and phenytoin resulted in an average decrease of 31-33% in exposure to the active metabolite, \neslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation, and an average increase of \n31-35% in exposure to phenytoin, most likely caused by an inhibition of CYP2C19. Based on \nindividual response, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased and the dose of \nphenytoin may need to be decreased. \n \nLamotrigine \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for both eslicarbazepine and lamotrigine and \ntherefore, an interaction could be expected. A study in healthy subjects with eslicarbazepine acetate \n1,200 mg once daily showed a minor average pharmacokinetic interaction (exposure of lamotrigine \ndecreased 15%) between eslicarbazepine acetate and lamotrigine and consequently no dose \nadjustments are required. However, due to inter-individual variability, the effect may be clinically \nrelevant in some individuals. \n \nTopiramate \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and topiramate showed no significant change in exposure to eslicarbazepine but an 18% decrease \nin exposure to topiramate, most likely caused by a reduced bioavailability of topiramate. No dose \nadjustment is required.  \n \nValproate and levetiracetam \nA population pharmacokinetics analysis of phase III studies in epileptic adult patients indicated that \nconcomitant administration with valproate or levetiracetam did not affect the exposure to \neslicarbazepine but this has not been verified by conventional interaction studies.  \n \nOxcarbazepine \nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may \ncause overexposure to the active metabolites. \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \nAdministration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily to female subjects using a combined \noral contraceptive showed an average decrease of 37% and 42% in systemic exposure to \nlevonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, respectively, most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4. \nTherefore, women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception during treatment with \nZebinix, and up to the end of the current menstruation cycle after the treatment has been discontinued \n(see section 4.6). \n \nSimvastatin \nA study in healthy subjects showed an average decrease of 50% in systemic exposure to simvastatin \nwhen co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily, most likely caused by an \ninduction of CYP3A4. An increase of the simvastatin dose may be required when used concomitantly \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nRosuvastatin \nThere was an average decrease of 36-39% in systemic exposure in healthy subjects when \nco-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily. The mechanism for this reduction \nis unknown, but could be due to interference of transporter activity for rosuvastatin alone or in \n\n\n\n41 \n\ncombination with induction of its metabolism. Since the relationship between exposure and drug \nactivity is unclear, the monitoring of response to therapy (e.g., cholesterol levels) is recommended. \n \nWarfarin \nCo-administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily with warfarin showed a small \n(23%), but statistically significant decrease in exposure to S-warfarin. There was no effect on the R-\nwarfarin pharmacokinetics or on coagulation. However, due to inter-individual variability in the \ninteraction, special attention on monitoring of INR should be performed the first weeks after initiation \nor ending concomitant treatment of warfarin and eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nDigoxin \nA study in healthy subjects showed no effect of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily on \ndigoxin pharmacokinetics, suggesting that eslicarbazepine acetate has no effect on the transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nMonoamino Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) \nBased on a structural relationship of eslicarbazepine acetate to tricyclic antidepressants, an interaction \nbetween eslicarbazepine acetate and MAOIs is theoretically possible.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Most \nfrequently reported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defects. Multiple \nantiepileptic medicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital \nmalformations than monotherapy, therefore it is important that monotherapy is practised whenever \npossible. Specialist advice should be given to women who are likely to become pregnant or who are of \nchild-bearing potential. The need for antiepileptic therapy should be reviewed when a woman is \nplanning to become pregnant. No sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic therapy should be undertaken \nas this may lead to breakthrough seizures which could have serious consequences for both mother and \nchild. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \nEslicarbazepine acetate adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, \neffective and safe method of contraception should be used during treatment and up to the end of the \ncurrent menstrual cycle after treatment has been stopped. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see Fertility). If women receiving eslicarbazepine acetate become \npregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of Zebinix should be carefully re-evaluated. Minimum \neffective doses should be given, and monotherapy whenever possible should be preferred at least \nduring the first three months of pregnancy. Patients should be counselled regarding the possibility of \nan increased risk of malformations and given the opportunity to antenatal screening. \n \nMonitoring and prevention \nAntiepileptic medicinal products may contribute to folic acid deficiency, a possible contributory cause \nof foetal abnormality. Folic acid supplementation is recommended before and during pregnancy. As \nthe efficacy of this supplementation is not proven, a specific antenatal diagnosis can be offered even \nfor women with a supplementary treatment of folic acid. \n \nIn the newborn child \nBleeding disorders in the newborn caused by antiepileptic medicinal products have been reported. As \na precaution, vitamin K1 should be administered as a preventive measure in the last few weeks of \npregnancy and to the newborn. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether eslicarbazepine acetate is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of eslicarbazepine in breast milk. As a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded breast-\nfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of eslicarbazepine acetate on human fertility. Studies in animals have \nshown impairment of fertility after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZebinix has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients might \nexperience dizziness, somnolence or visual disorders, particularly on initiation of treatment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised that their physical and/ or mental abilities needed for operating machinery \nor driving may be impaired and they are recommended not to do so until it has been established that \ntheir ability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical studies (adjunctive therapy treatment and monotherapy), 2,434 patients with partial-onset \nseizures were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate (1,983 adult patients and 451 paediatric patients) \nand 51% of those patients experienced adverse reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity and occurred predominantly during the \nfirst weeks of treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nThe risks that have been identified for Zebinix are mainly class-based, dose-dependent undesirable \neffects. The most common adverse reactions reported, in placebo controlled adjunctive therapy  \nstudies with adult epileptic patients and in an active controlled monotherapy study comparing \neslicarbazepine acetate with carbamazepine controlled release, were dizziness, somnolence, headache, \nand nausea. The majority of adverse reactions were reported in <3% of subjects in any treatment \ngroup. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with eslicarbazepine acetate obtained from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing surveillance are tabulated below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and not known (frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Treatment emergent adverse reactions associated with Zebinix obtained from clinical studies \nand post-marketing surveillance \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia \n\n\n\n43 \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  Hypothyroidism  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyponatraemia, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nElectrolyte \nimbalance, \ndehydration, \nhypochloraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Psychotic \ndisorder, apathy, \ndepression, \nnervousness, \nagitation, \nirritability, \nattention deficit/ \nhyperactivity \ndisorder, \nconfusional \nstate, mood \nswings, crying, \npsychomotor \nretardation, \nanxiety  \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nsomnolence \n \n\nHeadache, \ndisturbance in \nattention, \ntremor, ataxia, \nbalance disorder \n\nCoordination \nabnormal, \nmemory \nimpairment, \namnesia, \nhypersomnia, \nsedation, \naphasia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndystonia, \nlethargy, \nparosmia, \ncerebellar \nsyndrome, \nconvulsion, \nperipheral \nneuropathy, \nnystagmus, \nspeech disorder, \ndysarthria, \nburning \nsensation, \nparaesthesia, \nmigraine \n\n \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\nVisual \nimpairment, \noscillopsia, \nbinocular eye \nmovement \ndisorder, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo \n \n\nHypoacusis, \ntinnitus \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension \n(including \nhypertensive \ncrisis), \nhypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nflushing, \nperipheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Epistaxis, chest \npain \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nConstipation, \ndyspepsia, \ngastritis, \nabdominal pain, \ndry mouth, \nabdominal \ndiscomfort, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ngingivitis, \nmelaena, \ntoothache \n\nPancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver disorder  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \n \n\nAlopecia, dry \nskin, \nhyperhidrosis, \nerythema, skin \ndisorder, \npruritus, \ndermatitis \nallergic \n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome, \ndrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic symptoms \n(DRESS), \nangioedema, \nurticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, bone \nmetabolism \ndisorder, \nmuscular \nweakness, pain \nin extremity \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue, gait \ndisturbance, \nasthenia \n\nMalaise, chills, \noedema \nperipheral \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nInvestigations  Weight \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \ndecreased, \nweight \ndecreased, blood \npressure \nincreased, blood \nsodium \ndecreased, blood \nchloride \ndecreased, \nosteocalcin \nincreased, \nhaematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased, \ntransaminases \nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n  Drug toxicity, \nfall, thermal \nburn \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nEye and nervous system disorders \nIn patients concomitantly treated with carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate in placebo-\ncontrolled studies, the following adverse reactions were observed: diplopia (11.4% of subjects with \nconcomitant carbamazepine, 2.4% of subjects without concomitant carbamazepine), abnormal \ncoordination (6.7% with concomitant carbamazepine, 2.7% without concomitant carbamazepine), and \ndizziness (30.0% with concomitant carbamazepine, 11.5% without concomitant carbamazepine), see \nsection 4.5. \n \nPR interval \nThe use of eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \n \nClass related adverse reactions \nRare adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias did not occur during the placebo-controlled studies of \nthe epilepsy program with eslicarbazepine acetate. However, they have been reported with \noxcarbazepine. Therefore, their occurrence after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nThere have been reports of decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures in \npatients on long-term therapy with the structurally related antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and \noxcarbazepine. The mechanism by which bone metabolism is affected has not been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged from 2 to 18 years with partial-onset seizures \n(238 patients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate and 189 with placebo), 35.7% of patients treated \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate and 19% of patients treated with placebo experienced adverse reactions. \nThe most common adverse reaction in the group treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia \n(5.0%), somnolence (8.0%) and vomiting (4.6%). \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nThe adverse reaction profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is generally similar across age goups. In the age \ngroup from 6 to 11 years of age, the most common adverse reactions observed in more than two \npatients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia (9.5%), somnolence (7.4%), diziness \n(6.3%), convulsion (6.3%) and nausea (3.2%); in the age group from 12 to 18 years were somnolence \n(7.4%), vomiting (4.2%), diplopia (3.2%) and fatigue (3.2%). The safety of Zebinix in children aged 6 \nyears and below has not yet been established. \n \nThe safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was generally similar between adult and paediatric \npatients, except for agitation (common, 1.3%) and abdominal pain (common, 2.1%) which were more \ncommon in children than in adults. Dizziness; somnolence; vertigo; asthenia; gait disturbance; tremor; \nataxia; balance disorder; vision blurred; diarrhoea; rash and hyponatraemia were less common in \nchildren than in adults. Dermatitis allergic (uncommon, 0.8%) was reported only in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \nLong-term safety data in the paediatric population obtained from open label extensions of the phase \nIII study was consistent with the known safety profile of the product with no new findings of concern. \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms observed after an overdose of eslicarbazepine acetate are primarily associated with central \nnervous symptoms (e.g. seizures of all types, status epilepticus) and cardiac disorders (e.g. cardiac \narrhythmia). There is no known specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be \nadministered as appropriate. Eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites can effectively be cleared by \nhaemodialysis, if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives, ATC code: N03AF04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe precise mechanisms of action of eslicarbazepine acetate are unknown. However, in vitro \nelectrophysiological studies indicate that both eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites stabilise the \ninactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, precluding their return to the activated state and \nthereby preventing repetitive neuronal firing.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate and its active metabolites prevented the development of seizures in nonclinical \nmodels predictive of anticonvulsant efficacy in man. In humans, the pharmacological activity of \neslicarbazepine acetate is primarily exerted through the active metabolite eslicarbazepine. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nAdult population \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy has been demonstrated in four phase III \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies in 1,703 randomized adult patients with partial epilepsy \nrefractory to treatment with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Oxcarbazepine \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n47 \n\nand felbamate were not allowed as concomitant medicinal products in these studies. Eslicarbazepine \nacetate was tested at doses of 400 mg (in -301 and -302 studies only), 800 mg and 1,200 mg, once \ndaily. Eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 1,200 mg once daily were significantly more \neffective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency over a 12-week maintenance period. The \npercentage of subjects with ≥50% reduction (1581 analyzed) in seizure frequency in the phase III \nstudies was 19.3% for placebo, 20.8% for eslicarbazepine acetate 400 mg, 30.5% for eslicarbazepine \nacetate 800 mg and 35.3% for eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg daily.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy has been demonstrated in a double-blind, \nactive controlled (carbamazepine controlled release) study, involving 815 randomized adult patients \nwith newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at once-daily doses of \n800 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg. The doses of the active comparator, carbamazepine controlled \nrelease, were 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, twice-daily. All subjects were randomized to the lowest \ndose level and only if a seizure occurred subjects were to be escalated to the next dose level. From the \n815 randomized patients, 401 patients were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily [271 \npatients (67.6%) remained at dose of 800 mg, 70 patients (17.5%) remained at dose of 1,200 mg and \n60 patients (15.0%) were treated with 1,600 mg]. In the primary efficacy analysis, in which drop-outs \nwere considered as non-responders, 71.1% subjects were classified as seizure free in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group and 75.6% in the carbamazepine controlled release group during the \n26 week evaluation period (average risk difference -4.28%, 95% confidence interval: [-10,30; 1,74]. \nThe treatment effect observed during the 26-week evaluation period was maintained over 1 year of \ntreatment with 64.7 % eslicarbazepine acetate subjects and 70.3 % carbamazepine controlled release \nsubjects classified as seizure free (average risk difference -5.46%, 95% confidence interval: [-11.88; \n0.97]. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis and Cox regression), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk at the end of the evaluation \nperiod was 0.06 with carbamazepine and 0.12 with eslicarbazepine acetate and by the end of 1 year \nwith an additional increased risk to 0.11 with carbamazepine and 0.19 with eslicarbazepine acetate \n(p=0.0002).  \n \nAt 1 year, the probability for subjects to withdraw due to either adverse reactions or lack of efficacy \nwas 0.26 for eslicarbazepine acetate and 0.21 for carbamazepine controlled release.  \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as conversion to monotherapy was evaluated in 2 double-blind, \nrandomized controlled studies in 365 adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate \nwas tested at doses of 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg once-daily. Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week \nmonotherapy period were 7.6% (1,600 mg) and 8.3 % (1,200 mg) in one study and 10.0% (1,600 mg) \nand 7.4 % (1,200 mg) in the other study, respectively. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly \npatients were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged \n≥ 65 years). The data shows that the incidence of adverse reactions in this population (65.3 %) is \nsimilar to the general population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies (66.8%). The most \nfrequent individual adverse reactions were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, \nconvulsion and hyponatraemia (8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72 subjects starting the study completed the 26-week treatment \nperiod that corresponds to a retention rate of 69.4% (see section 4.2 for information on elderly use). \nThere is limited data on monotherapy regimen available in the erldely population. Only a few subjects \n(N=27) aged above 65 years were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate in monotherapy study. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in \nchildren was evaluated in one phase II study in children aged from 6 to 16 years (N=123) and one \nphase III study in children aged from 2 to 18 years (N=304). Both studies were double-blind and \nplacebo controlled with a duration of maintenance of 8 weeks (study 208) and 12 weeks (study 305), \nrespectively. Study 208 included 2 additional subsequent long-term, open-label extensions (1 year in \npart II and 2 years in part III) and Study 305 included 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension \n\n\n\n48 \n\nperiods (1 year in Parts II, III and IV and 2 years in Part V).  Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at \ndoses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day. The target dose was 30 mg/kg/day \nin study 208 and 20 mg/kg/day in study 305. Doses could be adjusted based on tolerability and \ntreatment response. \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase II study, evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective. The \nleast square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance period \nwas significantly (p<0.001) higher with eslicarbazepine acetate (-34.8%) compared to placebo (-\n13.8%). Forty-two patients (50.6%) in the eslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 10 patients \n(25.0%) in the placebo group were responders (≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), \nresulting in a significant difference (p=0.009).  \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase III study, the least square mean reduction in standardised \nseizure frequency with eslicarbazepine acetate (-18.1% versus baseline) was different to placebo (-\n8.6% versus baseline) but not statistically significant (p=0.2490). Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) in the placebo group were responders \n(≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), resulting in a non-significant difference \n(p=0.9017). Post-hoc subgroup analyses for the phase III study were conducted by age strata and \nabove 6 years, as well as by dose. In children above 6 years, 36 patients (35.0%) in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to 29 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group were responders (p=0.4759) and \nthe least square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency was higher in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to placebo (-24.4% versus -10.5%); however, the difference of 13.9% was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.1040). A total of 39% patients in study 305 were up titrated to the \nmaximum possible dose (30 mg/kg/day). Amongst these, when excluding patients aged 6 years and \nyounger, 14 (48.3%) and 11 (30.6%) of patients in the eslicarbazepine acetate and placebo group, \nrespectively, were responders (p=0.1514). Although the robustness of these post-hoc subgroup \nanalyses is limited, the data suggest an age and dose dependent increase in effect size. \n \nIn the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (Part II) of the phase III study (ITT set N=225) the total \nresponder rate was 46.7% (steadily increasing from 44.9% (weeks 1-4) to 57.5% (weeks > 40)). The \ntotal median standardised seizure frequency was 6.1 (decreasing from 7.0 (weeks 1-4) to 4.0 (weeks > \n40), resulting in a median relative change compared to the baseline period of -46.7%). The median \nrelative change was larger in the previous placebo group (-51.4%) than in the previous ESL group (-\n40.4%). The proportion of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%) compared to the baseline \nperiod was 14.2%. \n \nIn the subsequent 3 open-label extensions (ITT set N=148), the overall responder rate was 26.6% \nwhen compared to baseline Parts III–V (i.e. the last 4 weeks in part II). The total median standardised \nseizure frequency was 2.4 (resulting in a median relative change from Baseline Part III–V of -22.9%). \nThe overall median relative decrease in Part I was greater in patients treated with ESL (-25.8%) than \nin patients treated with placebo (-16.4%). The overall proportion of patients with exacerbation \n(increase of ≥25%) compared to Baseline Parts III–V was 25.7%. \n \nOf the 183 patients who completed parts I and II of the study, 152 patients were enrolled into part III. \nOf these, 65 patients had received ESL and 87 patients had received placebo during the double-blind \npart of the study. 14 patients (9.2%) completed open-label treatment with ESL through Part V. The \nmost common reason for withdrawal during any part of the study was sponsor request (30 patients in \npart III [19.7% of the patients who entered part III], 9 in part IV [9.6% of the patients who entered part \nIV], and 43 in part V [64.2% of the patients who entered Part V]). \n \nTaking into consideration the limitations of open label uncontrolled data, the long-term response to \neslicarbazepine acetate in the open-label parts of the study was overall maintained. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZebinix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of epilepsy with partial \nonset seizures (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of eslicarbazepine \nacetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. Eslicarbazepine \nCmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Bioavailability may be assumed as high because the \namount of metabolites recovered in urine corresponded to more than 90% of an eslicarbazepine acetate \ndose.  \n \nDistribution \nThe binding of eslicarbazepine to plasma proteins is relatively low (<40%) and independent from \nconcentration. In vitro studies have shown that plasma protein binding was not relevantly affected by \nthe presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide. The binding of warfarin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide was not significantly affected by the presence of \neslicarbazepine.  \n \nBiotransformation \nEslicarbazepine acetate is rapidly and extensively biotransformed to its major active metabolite \neslicarbazepine by hydrolytic first-pass metabolism. The steady state plasma concentrations are \nattained after 4 to 5 days of once daily dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of \n20-24 hours. In studies in healthy subjects and epileptic adult patients, the apparent half-life of \neslicarbazepine was 10-20 hours and 13-20 hours, respectively. Minor metabolites in plasma are R-\nlicarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, which were shown to be active, and the glucuronic acid conjugates \nof eslicarbazepine acetate, eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine.  \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate does not affect its own metabolism or clearance. \n \nEslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and has inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19 \n(as stated in section 4.5). \n \nIn studies with eslicarbazepine in fresh human hepatocytes a mild induction of UGT1A1 mediated \nglucuronidation was observed. \n \nElimination \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion, in the unchanged and glucuronide conjugate forms. In total, eslicarbazepine and its \nglucuronide correspond to more than 90% of total metabolites excreted in urine, approximately two \nthirds in the unchanged form and one third as glucuronide conjugate. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate is linear and dose-proportional in the range \n400-1,200 mg both in healthy subjects and patients. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is unaffected in the elderly patients with \ncreatinine clearance >60 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion. A study in adult patients with mild to severe renal impairment showed that clearance is \ndependent on renal function. During treatment with Zebinix dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients,adult and children above 6 years of age with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see section \n4.2).  \nIn children from 2 to 6 years of age, the use of eslicarbazepine acetate is not recommended. At this age \nthe intrinsic activity of the elimination process has not yet reached maturation. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \nHaemodialysis removes eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites from plasma.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eslicarbazepine acetate were evaluated in healthy subjects \nand moderately liver-impaired patients after multiple oral doses. Moderate hepatic impairment did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate. No dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients with mild to moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nGender \nStudies in healthy subjects and patients showed that pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate were \nnot affected by gender.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSimilar to adults, eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of \neslicarbazepine acetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. \nEslicarbazepine Cmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Body weight was shown to have an \neffect on volume of distribution and clearance. Furthermore, a role of age independently of weight \nwith regards to clearance of eslicarbazepine acetate could not be excluded, in particular for the \nyoungest age group (2-6 years). \n \nChildren aged 6 years and below \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that in the subgroup of children aged from 2 to 6 years, doses of \n27.5 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day are required in order to achieve exposures that are equivalent to the \ntherapeutic doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years of age. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that comparable eslicarbazepine exposure is observed between \n20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years old and adults with 800 and 1200 mg of \neslicarbazepine acetate once-daily, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies occurred at exposure levels appreciably lower than the \nclinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine (the principal and pharmacologically active metabolite of \neslicarbazepine acetate). Safety margins based on comparative exposure have thus not been \nestablished. \n \nEvidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in repeated dose-toxicity studies in the rat, but was not seen \nin studies in mice or dogs, and is consistent with an exacerbation of spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy in this species.  \n \nLiver centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats and an \nincreased incidence of liver tumours was observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice; these findings \nare consistent with an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been \nobserved in patients receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile dogs, the toxicity profile was comparable to that observed in adult \nanimals. In the 10-month study decreases in bone mineral content, bone area and/or bone mineral \ndensity in lumbar vertebrae and/or femur were observed in high-dose female animals at exposure \nlevels lower than the clinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine in children. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nGenotoxicity studies with eslicarbazepine acetate indicate no special hazards for humans.  \n \nImpairment of fertility was observed in female rats; decreases in implantations and live embryos seen \nin the mouse fertility study may also indicate effects on female fertility, however, corpora lutea counts \nwere not evaluated. Eslicarbazepine acetate was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit, but did induce \nskeletal abnormalities in the mouse. Ossification delays, reduced foetal weights, an increase in minor \nskeletal and visceral anomalies were observed at maternal toxic doses in embryotoxicity studies in \nmice, rats and rabbits. A delay in the sexual development of the F1 generation was observed in \nperi/postnatal studies in mice and rats. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZebinix 800 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 800 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite oblong tablets, engraved ‘ESL 800’on one side and scored on the other side, with a length of 19 \nmm. The tablet can be divided into equal doses.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZebinix is indicated as: \n \n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; \n\n• adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years with partial-onset \nseizures with or without secondary generalisation. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \nZebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The recommended \nstarting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two \nweeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily  Some \npatients on monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nNo dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not \ndisturbed. Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is \nnot recommended for this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients, adult and children above 6 years of age, with \nrenal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance (CLCR) as follows: \n- CLCR >60 ml/min: no dose adjustment required. \n- CLCR 30-60 ml/min: initial dose of 200 mg (or 5 mg/kg in children above 6 years) once daily or \n\n400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years) every other day for 2 weeks followed by a once \ndaily dose of 400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years). However, based on individual \nresponse, the dose may be increased. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n- CLCR <30 ml/min: use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to \ninsufficient data. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) and use in these patients is, therefore, not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren above 6 years of age \nThe recommended starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day once daily. Dosage should be increased in weekly or \nbi-weekly increments of 10 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/kg/daybased on individual response. the maximum \ndose is 1,200 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren with a body weight of ≥60 kg \nChildren with a body weight of 60 kg or more should be given the same dose as for adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children aged 6 years and below has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nZebinix may be taken with or without food. \n \nSwitching preparations \nBased on comparative bioavailability data for the tablet and the suspension formulations, switching  \npatients from one formulation to the other can be done. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSecond or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic active \nsubstances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for eslicarbazepine acetate. Therefore patients should be monitored for \nsigns of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour emerge. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such \nas dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.  \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nIf Zebinix is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential \nof increased seizure frequency.  \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash developed as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of total population treated with Zebinix in clinical \nstudies in epileptic patients. Urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported in patients taking \nZebinix. Angioedema in the context of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction associated with \nlaryngeal oedema can be fatal. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, eslicarbazepine \nacetate must be discontinued immediately and alternative treatment should be initiated.  \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix \ntreatment. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nZebinix should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). If \nthe patients have developed such reactions, treatment with Zebinix must not be restarted in these \npatients at any time. \n \nHLA-B* 1502 allele - in Han Chinese, Thai and other Asian populations \n \nHLA-B* 1502 in individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin has been shown to be strongly associated \nwith the risk of developing the severe cutaneous reactions known as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) \nwhen treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of eslicarbazepine acetate is similar to that \nof carbamazepine, and it is possible that patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 may also be at risk \nfor SJS after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. The prevalence of HLA-B*1502 carrier is about \n10% in Han Chinese and Thai populations. Whenever possible, these individuals should be screened \nfor this allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine or chemically-related active substances. If \npatients of these ethnic origins are tested positive for HLA- B*1502 allele, the use of eslicarbazepine \nacetate may be considered if the benefits are thought to exceed risks. \nBecause of the prevalence of this allele in other Asian populations (e.g, above 15% in the Philippines \nand Malaysia), testing genetically at risk populations for the presence of HLA- B*1502 may be \nconsidered. \n \nHLA-A*3101 allele- European descent and Japanese populations \n \nThere are some data that suggest HLA-A*3101 is associated with an increased risk of carbamazepine \ninduced cutaneous adverse drug reactions including SJS, TEN, Drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), \nor less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash in people \nof European descent and the Japanese. \nThe frequency of the HLA-A*3101 allele varies widely between ethnic populations. HLA-A*3101 \nallele has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in European populations and about 10% in Japanese population. \nThe presence of HLA-A*3101 allele may increase the risk for carbamazepine induced cutaneous \nreactions (mostly less severe) from 5.0% in general population to 26.0% among subjects of European \nancestry, whereas its absence may reduce the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. \nThere are insufficient data supporting a recommendation for HLA-A*3101 screening before starting \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds treatment. \nIf patients of European descent or Japanese origin are known to be positive for HLA-A*3101 allele, \nthe use of carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be considered if the benefits are \nthought to exceed risks. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.5% of patients treated with Zebinix. \nHyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms \n\n\n\n56 \n\nlike worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia \nincreased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease \nleading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may \nthemselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels \nshould be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum \nsodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium \nlevels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant \nhyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued. \n \nPR interval \n \nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac \nconduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated \nwith PR prolongation. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be \nadjusted according to creatinine clearance (see section 4.2). In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is \nnot recommended due to insufficient data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic \nand clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should \nbe used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, which is mainly eliminated by \nglucuronidation. In vitro eslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronyl \ntransferases. In vivo eslicarbazepine showed an inducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts that are mainly eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 (e.g. Simvastatin). Thus, an \nincrease in the dose of the medicinal products that are mainly metabolised through CYP3A4 may be \nrequired, when used concomitantly with eslicarbazepine acetate. Eslicarbazepine in vivo may have an \ninducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by conjugation \nthrough the UDP-glucuronyl transferases. When initiating or discontinuing treatment with Zebinix or \nchanging the dose, it may take 2 to 3 weeks to reach the new level of enzyme activity. This time delay \nmust be taken into account when Zebinix is being used just prior to or in combination with other \nmedicinal products that require dose adjustment when co-administered with Zebinix. Eslicarbazepine \nhas inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19. Thus, interactions can arise when co-administering \nhigh doses of eslicarbazepine acetate with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by \nCYP2C19 (e.g. Phenytoin). \n \nInteractions with other antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nCarbamazepine \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once \ndaily and carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average decrease of 32% in exposure to the \nactive metabolite eslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation. No change in \nexposure to carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-epoxide was noted. Based on individual \nresponse, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased if used concomitantly with \n\n\n\n57 \n\ncarbamazepine. Results from patient studies showed that concomitant treatment increased the risk of \nthe following adverse reactions: diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness. The risk of increase of \nother specific adverse reactions caused by co-administration of carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine \nacetate cannot be excluded.  \n \nPhenytoin \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and phenytoin resulted in an average decrease of 31-33% in exposure to the active metabolite, \neslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation, and an average increase of \n31-35% in exposure to phenytoin, most likely caused by an inhibition of CYP2C19. Based on \nindividual response, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased and the dose of \nphenytoin may need to be decreased. \n \nLamotrigine \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for both eslicarbazepine and lamotrigine and \ntherefore, an interaction could be expected. A study in healthy subjects with eslicarbazepine acetate \n1,200 mg once daily showed a minor average pharmacokinetic interaction (exposure of lamotrigine \ndecreased 15%) between eslicarbazepine acetate and lamotrigine and consequently no dose \nadjustments are required. However, due to inter-individual variability, the effect may be clinically \nrelevant in some individuals. \n \nTopiramate \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and topiramate showed no significant change in exposure to eslicarbazepine but an 18% decrease \nin exposure to topiramate, most likely caused by a reduced bioavailability of topiramate. No dose \nadjustment is required.  \n \nValproate and levetiracetam \nA population pharmacokinetics analysis of phase III studies in epileptic adult patients indicated that \nconcomitant administration with valproate or levetiracetam did not affect the exposure to \neslicarbazepine but this has not been verified by conventional interaction studies.  \n \nOxcarbazepine \nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may \ncause overexposure to the active metabolites. \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \nAdministration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily to female subjects using a combined \noral contraceptive showed an average decrease of 37% and 42% in systemic exposure to \nlevonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, respectively, most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4. \nTherefore, women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception during treatment with \nZebinix, and up to the end of the current menstruation cycle after the treatment has been discontinued \n(see section and 4.6). \n \nSimvastatin \nA study in healthy subjects showed an average decrease of 50% in systemic exposure to simvastatin \nwhen co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily, most likely caused by an \ninduction of CYP3A4. An increase of the simvastatin dose may be required when used concomitantly \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nRosuvastatin \nThere was an average decrease of 36-39% in systemic exposure in healthy subjects when \nco-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily. The mechanism for this reduction \nis unknown, but could be due to interference of transporter activity for rosuvastatin alone or in \n\n\n\n58 \n\ncombination with induction of its metabolism. Since the relationship between exposure and drug \nactivity is unclear, the monitoring of response to therapy (e.g., cholesterol levels) is recommended. \n \nWarfarin \nCo-administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily with warfarin showed a small \n(23%), but statistically significant decrease in exposure to S-warfarin. There was no effect on the R-\nwarfarin pharmacokinetics or on coagulation. However, due to inter-individual variability in the \ninteraction, special attention on monitoring of INR should be performed the first weeks after initiation \nor ending concomitant treatment of warfarin and eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nDigoxin \nA study in healthy subjects showed no effect of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily on \ndigoxin pharmacokinetics, suggesting that eslicarbazepine acetate has no effect on the transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nMonoamino Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) \nBased on a structural relationship of eslicarbazepine acetate to tricyclic antidepressants, an interaction \nbetween eslicarbazepine acetate and MAOIs is theoretically possible.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Most \nfrequently reported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defects. Multiple \nantiepileptic medicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital \nmalformations than monotherapy, therefore it is important that monotherapy is practised whenever \npossible. Specialist advice should be given to women who are likely to become pregnant or who are of \nchild-bearing potential. The need for antiepileptic therapy should be reviewed when a woman is \nplanning to become pregnant. No sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic therapy should be undertaken \nas this may lead to breakthrough seizures which could have serious consequences for both mother and \nchild. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \nEslicarbazepine acetate adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, \neffective and safe method of contraception should be used during treatment and up to the end of the \ncurrent menstrual cycle after treatment has been stopped. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see Fertility). If women receiving eslicarbazepine acetate become \npregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of Zebinix should be carefully re-evaluated. Minimum \neffective doses should be given, and monotherapy whenever possible should be preferred at least \nduring the first three months of pregnancy. Patients should be counselled regarding the possibility of \nan increased risk of malformations and given the opportunity to antenatal screening. \n \nMonitoring and prevention \nAntiepileptic medicinal products may contribute to folic acid deficiency, a possible contributory cause \nof foetal abnormality. Folic acid supplementation is recommended before and during pregnancy. As \nthe efficacy of this supplementation is not proven, a specific antenatal diagnosis can be offered even \nfor women with a supplementary treatment of folic acid. \n \nIn the newborn child \nBleeding disorders in the newborn caused by antiepileptic medicinal products have been reported. As \na precaution, vitamin K1 should be administered as a preventive measure in the last few weeks of \npregnancy and to the newborn. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether eslicarbazepine acetate is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of eslicarbazepine in breast milk. As a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded breast-\nfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of eslicarbazepine acetate on human fertility. Studies in animals have \nshown impairment of fertility after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZebinix has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients might \nexperience dizziness, somnolence or visual disorders, particularly on initiation of treatment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised that their physical and/or mental abilities needed for operating machinery or \ndriving may be impaired and they are recommended not to do so until it has been established that their \nability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nIn clinical studies (adjunctive therapy treatment and monotherapy), 2,434 patients with partial-onset \nseizures were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate (1,983 adult patients and 451 paediatric patients) \nand 51% of those patients experienced adverse reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity and occurred predominantly during the \nfirst weeks of treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nThe risks that have been identified for Zebinix are mainly class-based, dose-dependent  undesirable \neffects. The most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported, in placebo controlled \nadjunctive therapy studies with adult epileptic patients and in an active controlled monotherapy study \ncomparing eslicarbazepine acetate with carbamazepine controlled release, were dizziness, somnolence, \nheadache, and nausea. The majority of adverse reactions were reported in <3% of subjects in any \ntreatment group. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with eslicarbazepine acetate obtained from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing surveillance are tabulated below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and not known (frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Treatment emergent adverse reactions associated with Zebinix obtained from in clinical \nstudies and post-marketing surveillance \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia \n\n\n\n60 \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  Hypothyroidism  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyponatraemia, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nElectrolyte \nimbalance, \ndehydration, \nhypochloraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Psychotic \ndisorder, apathy, \ndepression, \nnervousness, \nagitation, \nirritability, \nattention deficit/ \nhyperactivity \ndisorder, \nconfusional \nstate, mood \nswings, crying, \npsychomotor \nretardation, \nanxiety  \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nsomnolence \n \n\nHeadache, \ndisturbance in \nattention, \ntremor, ataxia, \nbalance disorder \n\nCoordination \nabnormal, \nmemory \nimpairment, \namnesia, \nhypersomnia, \nsedation, \naphasia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndystonia, \nlethargy, \nparosmia, \ncerebellar \nsyndrome, \nconvulsion, \nperipheral \nneuropathy, \nnystagmus, \nspeech disorder, \ndysarthria, \nburning \nsensation, \nparaesthesia, \nmigraine \n\n \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\nVisual \nimpairment, \noscillopsia, \nbinocular eye \nmovement \ndisorder, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo \n \n\nHypoacusis, \ntinnitus \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension \n(including \nhypertensive \ncrisis), \nhypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nflushing, \nperipheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Epistaxis, chest \npain \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nConstipation, \ndyspepsia, \ngastritis, \nabdominal pain, \ndry mouth, \nabdominal \ndiscomfort, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ngingivitis , \nmelaena, \ntoothache \n\nPancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver disorder  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \n \n\nAlopecia, dry \nskin, \nhyperhidrosis, \nerythema, skin \ndisorder, \npruritus, \ndermatitis \nallergic \n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome, \ndrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic symptoms \n(DRESS), \nangioedema, \nurticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, bone \nmetabolism \ndisorder, \nmuscular \nweakness, pain \nin extremity \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue, gait \ndisturbance, \nasthenia \n\nMalaise, chills, \noedema \nperipheral \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nInvestigations  Weight \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \ndecreased, \nweight \ndecreased, blood \npressure \nincreased, blood \nsodium \ndecreased, blood \nchloride \ndecreased, \nosteocalcin \nincreased, \nhaematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased, \ntransaminases \nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications  \n\n  Drug toxicity, \nfall, thermal \nburn \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nEye and nervous system disorders \nIn patients concomitantly treated with carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate in placebo-\ncontrolled studies, the following adverse reactions were observed: diplopia (11.4% of subjects with \nconcomitant carbamazepine, 2.4% of subjects without concomitant carbamazepine), abnormal \ncoordination (6.7% with concomitant carbamazepine, 2.7% without concomitant carbamazepine), and \ndizziness (30.0% with concomitant carbamazepine, 11.5% without concomitant carbamazepine), see \nsection 4.5. \n \nPR interval \nThe use of eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \n \nClass related adverse reactions \nRare adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias did not occur during the placebo-controlled studies of \nthe epilepsy program with eslicarbazepine acetate. However, they have been reported with \noxcarbazepine. Therefore, their occurrence after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nThere have been reports of decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures in \npatients on long-term therapy with the structurally related antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and \noxcarbazepine. The mechanism by which bone metabolism is affected has not been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged from 2 to 18 years with partial-onset seizures \n(238 patients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate and 189 with placebo), 35.7% of patients treated \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate and 19% of patients treated with placebo experienced adverse reactions.  \nThe most common adverse reaction in the group treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia \n(5.0%), somnolence (8.0%) and vomiting (4.6%). \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nThe adverse reaction profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is generally similar across age goups. In the age \ngroup from 6 to 11 years of age, the most common adverse reaction observed in more than two \npatients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia (9.5%), somnolence (7.4%), diziness \n(6.3%), convulsion (6.3%) and nausea (3.2%); in the age group from 12 to 18 years were somnolence \n(7.4%), vomiting (4.2%), diplopia (3.2%) and fatigue (3.2%). The safety of Zebinix in children aged 6 \nyears and below has not yet been established. \n \nThe safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was generally similar between adult and paediatric \npatients, except for agitation (common, 1.3%) and abdominal pain (common, 2.1%) which were more \ncommon in children than in adults. Dizziness; somnolence; vertigo; asthenia; gait disturbance; tremor; \nataxia; balance disorder; vision blurred; diarrhoea; rash and hyponatraemia were less common in \nchildren than in adults. Dermatitis allergic (uncommon, 0.8%) was reported only in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \nLong-term safety data in the paediatric population obtained from open label extensions of the phase III \nstudy was consistent with the known safety profile of the product with no new findings of concern. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms observed after an overdose of eslicarbazepine acetate are primarily associated with central \nnervous symptoms (e.g. seizures of all types, status epilepticus) and cardiac disorders (e.g. cardiac \narrhythmia). There is no known specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be \nadministered as appropriate. Eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites can effectively be cleared by \nhaemodialysis, if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives, ATC code: N03AF04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe precise mechanisms of action of eslicarbazepine acetate are unknown. However, in vitro \nelectrophysiological studies indicate that both eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites stabilise the \ninactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, precluding their return to the activated state and \nthereby preventing repetitive neuronal firing.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate and its active metabolites prevented the development of seizures in nonclinical \nmodels predictive of anticonvulsant efficacy in man. In humans, the pharmacological activity of \neslicarbazepine acetate is primarily exerted through the active metabolite eslicarbazepine. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nAdult population \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy has been demonstrated in four phase III \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies in 1,703 randomized adult patients with partial epilepsy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n64 \n\nrefractory to treatment with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Oxcarbazepine \nand felbamate were not allowed as concomitant medicinal products in these studies. Eslicarbazepine \nacetate was tested at doses of 400 mg (in -301 and -302 studies only), 800 mg and 1,200 mg, once \ndaily. Eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 1,200 mg once daily were significantly more \neffective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency over a 12-week maintenance period. The \npercentage of subjects with ≥50% reduction (1581 analyzed) in seizure frequency in the phase III \nstudies was 19.3% for placebo, 20.8% for eslicarbazepine acetate 400 mg, 30.5% for eslicarbazepine \nacetate 800 mg and 35.3% for eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg daily.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy has been demonstrated in a double-blind, \nactive controlled (carbamazepine controlled release) study, involving 815 randomized adult patients \nwith newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at once-daily doses of \n800 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg. The doses of the active comparator, carbamazepine controlled \nrelease, were 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, twice-daily. All subjects were randomized to the lowest \ndose level and only if a seizure occurred subjects were to be escalated to the next dose level. From the \n815 randomized patients, 401 patients were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily [271 \npatients (67.6%) remained at dose of 800 mg, 70 patients (17.5%) remained at dose of 1,200 mg and \n60 patients (15.0%) were treated with 1,600 mg]. In the primary efficacy analysis, in which drop-outs \nwere considered as non-responders, 71.1% subjects were classified as seizure free in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group and 75.6% in the carbamazepine controlled release group during the \n26 week evaluation period (average risk difference -4.28%, 95% confidence interval: [-10,30; 1,74]. \nThe treatment effect observed during the 26-week evaluation period was maintained over 1 year of \ntreatment with 64.7 % eslicarbazepine acetate subjects and 70.3 % carbamazepine controlled release \nsubjects classified as seizure free (average risk difference -5.46%, 95% confidence interval: [-11.88; \n0.97]. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis and Cox regression), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk at the end of the evaluation \nperiod was 0.06 with carbamazepine and 0.12 with eslicarbazepine acetate and by the end of 1 year \nwith an additional increased risk to 0.11 with carbamazepine and 0.19 with eslicarbazepine acetate \n(p=0.0002). \n \nAt 1 year, the probability for subjects to withdraw due to either adverse reactions or lack of efficacy \nwas 0.26 for eslicarbazepine acetate and 0.21 for carbamazepine controlled release.  \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as conversion to monotherapy was evaluated in 2 double-blind, \nrandomized controlled studies in 365 adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate \nwas tested at doses of 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg once-daily. Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week \nmonotherapy period were 7.6% (1,600 mg) and 8.3 % (1,200 mg) in one study and 10.0% (1,600 mg) \nand 7.4 % (1,200 mg) in the other study, respectively. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly \npatients were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged \n≥ 65 years). The data shows that the incidence of adverse reactions in this population (65.3 %) is \nsimilar to the general population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies (66.8%). The most \nfrequent individual adverse reactions were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, \nconvulsion and hyponatraemia (8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72 subjects starting the study completed the 26-week treatment \nperiod that corresponds to a retention rate of 69.4% (see section 4.2 for information on elderly use). \nThere is limited data on monotherapy regimen available in the erldely population. Only a few subjects \n(N=27) aged above 65 years were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate in monotherapy study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in \nchildren was evaluated in one phase II study in children aged from 6 to 16 years (N=123) and one \nphase III study in children aged from 2 to 18 years (N=304). Both studies were double-blind and \nplacebo controlled with a duration of maintenance of 8 weeks (study 208) and 12 weeks (study 305), \nrespectively. Study 208 included 2 additional subsequent long-term, open-label extensions (1 year in \n\n\n\n65 \n\npart II and 2 years in part III) and Study 305 included 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension \nperiods (1 year in Parts II, III and IV and 2 years in Part V). Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at \ndoses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day. The target dose was 30 mg/kg/day \nin study 208 and 20 mg/kg/day in study 305. Doses could be adjusted based on tolerability and \ntreatment response. \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase II study, evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective. The \nleast square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance period \nwas significantly (p<0.001) higher with eslicarbazepine acetate (-34.8%) compared to placebo (-\n13.8%). Forty-two patients (50.6%) in the eslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 10 patients \n(25.0%) in the placebo group were responders (≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), \nresulting in a significant difference (p=0.009).  \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase III study, the least square mean reduction in standardised \nseizure frequency with eslicarbazepine acetate (-18.1% versus baseline) was different to placebo (-\n8.6% versus baseline) but not statistically significant (p=0.2490). Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) in the placebo group were responders \n(≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), resulting in a non-significant difference \n(p=0.9017). Post-hoc subgroup analyses for the phase III study were conducted by age strata and \nabove 6 years, as well as by dose. In children above 6 years, 36 patients (35.0%) in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to 29 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group were responders (p=0.4759) and \nthe least square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency was higher in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to placebo (-24.4% versus -10.5%); however, the difference of 13.9% was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.1040). A total of 39% patients in study 305 were up titrated to the \nmaximum possible dose (30 mg/kg/day). Amongst these, when excluding patients aged 6 years and \nyounger, 14 (48.3%) and 11 (30.6%) of patients in the eslicarbazepine acetate and placebo group, \nrespectively, were responders (p=0.1514). Although the robustness of these post-hoc subgroup \nanalyses is limited, the data suggest an age and dose dependent increase in effect size. \n \nIn the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (Part II) of the phase III study (ITT set N=225) the total \nresponder rate was 46.7% (steadily increasing from 44.9% (weeks 1-4) to 57.5% (weeks > 40)). The \ntotal median standardised seizure frequency was 6.1 (decreasing from 7.0 (weeks 1-4) to 4.0 (weeks > \n40), resulting in a median relative change compared to the baseline period of -46.7%). The median \nrelative change was larger in the previous placebo group (-51.4%) than in the previous ESL group (-\n40.4%). The proportion of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%) compared to the baseline \nperiod was 14.2%. \n \nIn the subsequent 3 open-label extensions (ITT set N=148), the overall responder rate was 26.6% \nwhen compared to baseline Parts III–V (i.e. the last 4 weeks in part II). The total median standardised \nseizure frequency was 2.4 (resulting in a median relative change from Baseline Part III–V of -22.9%). \nThe overall median relative decrease in Part I was greater in patients treated with ESL (-25.8%) than \nin patients treated with placebo (-16.4%). The overall proportion of patients with exacerbation \n(increase of ≥25%) compared to Baseline Parts III–V was 25.7%. \n \nOf the 183 patients who completed parts I and II of the study, 152 patients were enrolled into part III. \nOf these, 65 patients had received ESL and 87 patients had received placebo during the double-blind \npart of the study. 14 patients (9.2%) completed open-label treatment with ESL through Part V. The \nmost common reason for withdrawal during any part of the study was sponsor request (30 patients in \npart III [19.7% of the patients who entered part III], 9 in part IV [9.6% of the patients who entered part \nIV], and 43 in part V [64.2% of the patients who entered Part V]). \n \nTaking into consideration the limitations of open label uncontrolled data, the long-term response to \neslicarbazepine acetate in the open-label parts of the study was overall maintained. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZebinix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of epilepsy with partial \nonset seizures (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of eslicarbazepine \nacetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. Eslicarbazepine \nCmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Bioavailability may be assumed as high because the \namount of metabolites recovered in urine corresponded to more than 90% of an eslicarbazepine acetate \ndose.  \n \nDistribution \nThe binding of eslicarbazepine to plasma proteins is relatively low (<40%) and independent from \nconcentration. In vitro studies have shown that plasma protein binding was not relevantly affected by \nthe presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide. The binding of warfarin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide was not significantly affected by the presence of \neslicarbazepine.  \n \nBiotransformation \nEslicarbazepine acetate is rapidly and extensively biotransformed to its major active metabolite \neslicarbazepine by hydrolytic first-pass metabolism. The steady state plasma concentrations are \nattained after 4 to 5 days of once daily dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of \n20-24 hours. In studies in healthy subjects and epileptic adult patients, the apparent half-life of \neslicarbazepine was 10-20 hours and 13-20 hours, respectively. Minor metabolites in plasma are R-\nlicarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, which were shown to be active, and the glucuronic acid conjugates \nof eslicarbazepine acetate, eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine.  \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate does not affect its own metabolism or clearance. \n \nEslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and has inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19 \n(as stated in section 4.5). \n \nIn studies with eslicarbazepine in fresh human hepatocytes a mild induction of UGT1A1 mediated \nglucuronidation was observed. \n \nElimination \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion, in the unchanged and glucuronide conjugate forms. In total, eslicarbazepine and its \nglucuronide correspond to more than 90% of total metabolites excreted in urine, approximately two \nthirds in the unchanged form and one third as glucuronide conjugate. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate is linear and dose-proportional in the range \n400-1,200 mg both in healthy subjects and patients. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is unaffected in the elderly patients with \ncreatinine clearance >60 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion. A study in adult patients with mild to severe renal impairment showed that clearance is \ndependent on renal function. During treatment with Zebinix dose adjustment is recommended in \n\n\n\n67 \n\npatients, adult and children above 6 years of age with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see section \n4.2).  \nIn children from 2 to 6 years of age, the use of eslicarbazepine acetate is not recommended. At this age \nthe intrinsic activity of the elimination process has not yet reached maturation. \n \nHaemodialysis removes eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites from plasma.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eslicarbazepine acetate were evaluated in healthy subjects \nand moderately liver-impaired patients after multiple oral doses. Moderate hepatic impairment did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate. No dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients with mild to moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nGender \nStudies in healthy subjects and patients showed that pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate were \nnot affected by gender.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSimilar to adults, eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of \neslicarbazepine acetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. \nEslicarbazepine Cmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Body weight was shown to have an \neffect on volume of distribution and clearance. Furthermore, a role of age independently of weight \nwith regards to clearance of eslicarbazepine acetate could not be excluded, in particular for the \nyoungest age group (2-6 years). \n \nChildren aged 6 years and below \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that in the subgroup of children aged from 2 to 6 years, doses of \n27.5 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day are required in order to achieve exposures that are equivalent to the \ntherapeutic doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years of age. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that comparable eslicarbazepine exposure is observed between \n20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years old and adults with 800 and 1200 mg of \neslicarbazepine acetate once-daily, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies occurred at exposure levels appreciably lower than the \nclinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine (the principal and pharmacologically active metabolite of \neslicarbazepine acetate). Safety margins based on comparative exposure have thus not been \nestablished. \n \nEvidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in repeated dose-toxicity studies in the rat, but was not seen \nin studies in mice or dogs, and is consistent with an exacerbation of spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy in this species.  \n \nLiver centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats and an \nincreased incidence of liver tumours was observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice; these findings \nare consistent with an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been \nobserved in patients receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n\n\n\n68 \n\nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile dogs, the toxicity profile was comparable to that observed in adult \nanimals. In the 10-month study decreases in bone mineral content, bone area and/or bone mineral \ndensity in lumbar vertebrae and/or femur were observed in high-dose female animals at exposure \nlevels lower than the clinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine in children. \n \nGenotoxicity studies with eslicarbazepine acetate indicate no special hazards for humans.  \n \nImpairment of fertility was observed in female rats; decreases in implantations and live embryos seen \nin the mouse fertility study may also indicate effects on female fertility, however, corpora lutea counts \nwere not evaluated. Eslicarbazepine acetate was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit, but did induce \nskeletal abnormalities in the mouse. Ossification delays, reduced foetal weights, an increase in minor \nskeletal and visceral anomalies were observed at maternal toxic doses in embryotoxicity studies in \nmice, rats and rabbits. A delay in the sexual development of the F1 generation was observed in \nperi/postnatal studies in mice and rats. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZebinix 50 mg/ml oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of oral suspension contains 50 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach ml of oral suspension contains 2.0 mg of methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and approximately \n0.00001 mg of sulphites. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral suspension. \nOff-white to white suspension.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZebinix is indicated as: \n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; \n\n• adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with partial-onset \nseizures with or without secondary generalisation. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nZebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The recommended \nstarting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two \nweeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily  Some \npatients on monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nNo dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not \ndisturbed. Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is \nnot recommended for this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients, adult and children above 6 years of age, with \nrenal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance (CLCR) as follows: \n- CLCR >60 ml/min: no dose adjustment required. \n- CLCR 30-60 ml/min: initial dose of 200 mg (or 5 mg/kg in children above 6 years) once daily or \n\n400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years)every other day for 2 weeks followed by a once \ndaily dose of 400 mg (or 10 mg/kg in children above 6 years). However, based on individual \nresponse, the dose may be increased. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n- CLCR <30 ml/min: use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to \ninsufficient data. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) and use in these patients is, therefore, not recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren above 6 years of age \nThe recommended starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day once daily. Dosage should be increased in weekly or \nbi-weekly increments of 10 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/kg/day,based on individual response. The \nmaximum dose is1,200 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren with a body weight of ≥60 kg \nChildren with a body weight of 60 kg or more should be given the same dose as for adults. \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children aged 6 years and below has not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nZebinix may be taken with or without food. \n \nSwitching preparations \nBased on comparative bioavailability data for the tablet and the suspension formulations, switching  \npatients from one formulation to the other can be done. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSecond or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuicidal ideation \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic active \nsubstances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for eslicarbazepine acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored for \nsigns of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or \nbehaviour emerge. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such \nas dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.  \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nIf Zebinix is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential \nof increased seizure frequency.  \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nRash developed as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of total population treated with Zebinix in  clinical \nstudies in epileptic patients. Urticaria and angioedema cases have been reported in patients taking \nZebinix. Angioedema in the context of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction associated with \nlaryngeal oedema can be fatal. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, eslicarbazepine \nacetate must be discontinued immediately and alternative treatment should be initiated.  \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix \ntreatment. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nZebinix should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). If \nthe patients have developed such reactions, treatment with Zebinix must not be restarted in these \npatients at any time. \n \nHLA-B* 1502 allele - in Han Chinese, Thai and other Asian populations \n \nHLA-B* 1502 in individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin has been shown to be strongly associated \nwith the risk of developing the severe cutaneous reactions known as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) \nwhen treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of eslicarbazepine acetate is similar to that \nof carbamazepine, and it is possible that patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 may also be at risk \nfor SJS after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. The prevalence of HLA-B*1502 carrier is about \n10% in Han Chinese and Thai populations. Whenever possible, these individuals should be screened \nfor this allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine or chemically-related active substances. If \npatients of these ethnic origins are tested positive for HLA- B*1502 allele, the use of eslicarbazepine \nacetate may be considered if the benefits are thought to exceed risks. \nBecause of the prevalence of this allele in other Asian populations (e.g, above 15% in the Philippines \nand Malaysia), testing genetically at risk populations for the presence of HLA- B*1502 may be \nconsidered. \n \nHLA-A*3101 allele- European descent and Japanese populations \n \nThere are some data that suggest HLA-A*3101 is associated with an increased risk of carbamazepine \ninduced cutaneous adverse drug reactions including SJS, TEN, Drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), \nor less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash in people \nof European descent and the Japanese. \nThe frequency of the HLA-A*3101 allele varies widely between ethnic populations. HLA-A*3101 \nallele has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in European populations and about 10% in Japanese population. \nThe presence of HLA-A*3101 allele may increase the risk for carbamazepine induced cutaneous \nreactions (mostly less severe) from 5.0% in general population to 26.0% among subjects of European \nancestry, whereas its absence may reduce the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. \nThere are insufficient data supporting a recommendation for HLA-A*3101 screening before starting \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds treatment. \nIf patients of European descent or Japanese origin are known to be positive for HLA-A*3101 allele, \nthe use of carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be considered if the benefits are \nthought to exceed risks. \n \nHyponatraemia \n \nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.5% of patients treated with Zebinix. \nHyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms \nlike worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia \n\n\n\n73 \n\nincreased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease \nleading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may \nthemselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels \nshould be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum \nsodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium \nlevels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant \nhyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued. \n \nPR interval \n \nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac \nconduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated \nwith PR prolongation. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be \nadjusted according to creatinine clearance (see section 4.2). In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is \nnot recommended due to insufficient data. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic \nand clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should \nbe used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nZebinix oral suspension contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed) and sulphites which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions \nand bronchospasm. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, which is mainly eliminated by \nglucuronidation. In vitro eslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronyl \ntransferases. In vivo eslicarbazepine showed an inducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal \nproducts that are mainly eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 (e.g. Simvastatin). Thus, an \nincrease in the dose of the medicinal products that are mainly metabolised through CYP3A4 may be \nrequired, when used concomitantly with eslicarbazepine acetate. Eslicarbazepine in vivo may have an \ninducing effect on the metabolism of medicinal products that are mainly eliminated by conjugation \nthrough the UDP-glucuronyl transferases. When initiating or discontinuing treatment with Zebinix or \nchanging the dose, it may take 2 to 3 weeks to reach the new level of enzyme activity. This time delay \nmust be taken into account when Zebinix is being used just prior to or in combination with other \nmedicinal products that require dose adjustment when co-administered with Zebinix. Eslicarbazepine \nhas inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19. Thus, interactions can arise when co-administering \nhigh doses of eslicarbazepine acetate with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by \nCYP2C19 (e.g. Phenytoin). \n \nInteractions with other antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nCarbamazepine \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once \ndaily and carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily resulted in an average decrease of 32% in exposure to the \n\n\n\n74 \n\nactive metabolite eslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation. No change in \nexposure to carbamazepine or its metabolite carbamazepine-epoxide was noted. Based on individual \nresponse, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased if used concomitantly with \ncarbamazepine. Results from patient studies showed that concomitant treatment increased the risk of \nthe following adverse reactions: diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness. The risk of increase of \nother specific adverse reactions caused by co-administration of carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine \nacetate cannot be excluded. \n \nPhenytoin \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and phenytoin resulted in an average decrease of 31-33% in exposure to the active metabolite, \neslicarbazepine, most likely caused by an induction of glucuronidation, and an average increase of \n31-35% in exposure to phenytoin, most likely caused by an inhibition of CYP2C19. Based on \nindividual response, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be increased and the dose of \nphenytoin may need to be decreased. \n \nLamotrigine \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for both eslicarbazepine and lamotrigine and, \ntherefore, an interaction could be expected. A study in healthy subjects with eslicarbazepine acetate \n1,200 mg once daily showed a minor average pharmacokinetic interaction (exposure of lamotrigine \ndecreased 15%) between eslicarbazepine acetate and lamotrigine and consequently no dose \nadjustments are required. However, due to inter-individual variability, the effect may be clinically \nrelevant in some individuals. \n \nTopiramate \nIn a study in healthy subjects, concomitant administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once \ndaily and topiramate showed no significant change in exposure to eslicarbazepine but an 18% decrease \nin exposure to topiramate, most likely caused by a reduced bioavailability of topiramate. No dose \nadjustment is required.  \n \nValproate and levetiracetam \nA population pharmacokinetics analysis of phase III studies in epileptic adult patients indicated that \nconcomitant administration with valproate or levetiracetam did not affect the exposure to \neslicarbazepine but this has not been verified by conventional interaction studies.  \n \nOxcarbazepine \nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may \ncause overexposure to the active metabolites. \n \nOther medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \nAdministration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily to female subjects using a combined \noral contraceptive showed an average decrease of 37% and 42% in systemic exposure to \nlevonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol, respectively, most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4. \nTherefore, women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception during treatment with \nZebinix, and up to the end of the current menstruation cycle after the treatment has been discontinued \n(see section 4.6). \n \nSimvastatin \nA study in healthy subjects showed an average decrease of 50% in systemic exposure to simvastatin \nwhen co-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily, most likely caused by an \ninduction of CYP3A4. An increase of the simvastatin dose may be required when used concomitantly \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nRosuvastatin \n\n\n\n75 \n\nThere was an average decrease of 36-39% in systemic exposure in healthy subjects when \nco-administered with eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily. The mechanism for this reduction \nis unknown, but could be due to interference of transporter activity for rosuvastatin alone or in \ncombination with induction of its metabolism. Since the relationship between exposure and drug \nactivity is unclear, the monitoring of response to therapy (e.g., cholesterol levels) is recommended. \n \nWarfarin \nCo-administration of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily with warfarin showed a small \n(23%), but statistically significant decrease in exposure to S-warfarin. There was no effect on the R-\nwarfarin pharmacokinetics or on coagulation. However, due to inter-individual variability in the \ninteraction, special attention on monitoring of INR should be performed the first weeks after initiation \nor ending concomitant treatment of warfarin and eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nDigoxin \nA study in healthy subjects showed no effect of eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg once daily on \ndigoxin pharmacokinetics, suggesting that eslicarbazepine acetate has no effect on the transporter P-\nglycoprotein. \n \nMonoamino Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) \nBased on a structural relationship of eslicarbazepine acetate to tricyclic antidepressants, an interaction \nbetween eslicarbazepine acetate and MAOIs is theoretically possible.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nRisk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nIt has been shown that in the offspring of women with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is \ntwo to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population. Most \nfrequently reported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defects. Multiple \nantiepileptic medicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital \nmalformations than monotherapy, therefore it is important that monotherapy is practised whenever \npossible. Specialist advice should be given to women who are likely to become pregnant or who are of \nchild-bearing potential. The need for antiepileptic therapy should be reviewed when a woman is \nplanning to become pregnant. No sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic therapy should be undertaken \nas this may lead to breakthrough seizures which could have serious consequences for both mother and \nchild. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \nEslicarbazepine acetate adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, \neffective and safe method of contraception should be used during treatment and up to the end of the \ncurrent menstrual cycle after treatment has been stopped. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see Fertility). If women receiving eslicarbazepine acetate become \npregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of Zebinix should be carefully re-evaluated. Minimum \neffective doses should be given, and monotherapy whenever possible should be preferred at least \nduring the first three months of pregnancy. Patients should be counselled regarding the possibility of \nan increased risk of malformations and given the opportunity to antenatal screening. \n \nMonitoring and prevention \nAntiepileptic medicinal products may contribute to folic acid deficiency, a possible contributory cause \nof foetal abnormality. Folic acid supplementation is recommended before and during pregnancy. As \nthe efficacy of this supplementation is not proven, a specific antenatal diagnosis can be offered even \nfor women with a supplementary treatment of folic acid. \n \nIn the newborn child \n\n\n\n76 \n\nBleeding disorders in the newborn caused by antiepileptic medicinal products have been reported. As \na precaution, vitamin K1 should be administered as a preventive measure in the last few weeks of \npregnancy and to the newborn. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is unknown whether eslicarbazepine acetate is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of eslicarbazepine in breast milk. As a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded breast-\nfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of eslicarbazepine acetate on human fertility. Studies in animals have \nshown impairment of fertility after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZebinix has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients might \nexperience dizziness, somnolence or visual disorders, particularly on initiation of treatment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised that their physical and/or mental abilities needed for operating machinery or \ndriving may be impaired and they are recommended not to do so until it has been established that their \nability to perform such activities is not affected. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n In clinical studies (adjunctive therapy treatment and monotherapy), 2,434 patients with partial-onset \nseizures were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate (1,983 adult patients and 451 paediatric patients) \nand 51% of those patients experienced adverse reactions. \nAdverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity and occurred predominantly during the \nfirst weeks of treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate.  \n \nThe risks that have been identified for Zebinix are mainly class-based, dose-dependent undesirable \neffects. The most common adverse reactions reported, in placebo controlled adjunctive therapy studies \nwith adult epileptic patients and in an active controlled monotherapy study comparing eslicarbazepine \nacetate with carbamazepine controlled release, were dizziness, somnolence, headache, and nausea. The \nmajority of adverse reactions were reported in <3% of subjects in any treatment group. \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARS), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported in post-marketing experience with Zebinix treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions associated with eslicarbazepine acetate obtained from clinical studies and post-\nmarketing surveillance are tabulated below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and not known (frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Treatment emergent adverse reactions associated with Zebinix obtained from  clinical studies \nand post-marketing surveillance \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Thrombocytopenia,\nleukopenia \n\n\n\n77 \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity  \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  Hypothyroidism  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyponatraemia, \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nElectrolyte \nimbalance, \ndehydration, \nhypochloraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Psychotic \ndisorder, apathy, \ndepression, \nnervousness, \nagitation, \nirritability, \nattention deficit/ \nhyperactivity \ndisorder, \nconfusional \nstate, mood \nswings, crying, \npsychomotor \nretardation, \nanxiety   \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nsomnolence \n \n\nHeadache, \ndisturbance in \nattention, \ntremor, ataxia, \nbalance disorder \n\nCoordination \nabnormal, \nmemory \nimpairment, \namnesia, \nhypersomnia, \nsedation, \naphasia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndystonia, \nlethargy, \nparosmia, \ncerebellar \nsyndrome, \nconvulsion, \nperipheral \nneuropathy, \nnystagmus, \nspeech disorder, \ndysarthria, \nburning \nsensation, \nparaesthesia, \nmigraine \n\n \n\nEye disorders  Diplopia, vision \nblurred \n\nVisual \nimpairment, \noscillopsia, \nbinocular eye \nmovement \ndisorder, ocular \nhyperaemia \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo \n \n\nHypoacusis, \ntinnitus \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Palpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension \n(including \nhypertensive \ncrisis), \nhypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nflushing, \nperipheral \ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Epistaxis, chest \npain \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nConstipation, \ndyspepsia, \ngastritis, \nabdominal pain, \ndry mouth, \nabdominal \ndiscomfort, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ngingivitis, \nmelaena, \ntoothache \n\nPancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Liver disorder  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \n \n\nAlopecia, dry \nskin, \nhyperhidrosis, \nerythema, skin \ndisorder, \npruritus, \ndermatitis \nallergic \n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome, \ndrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic symptoms \n(DRESS), \nangioedema, \nurticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Myalgia, bone \nmetabolism \ndisorder, \nmuscular \nweakness, pain \nin extremity \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Urinary tract \ninfection \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fatigue, gait \ndisturbance, \nasthenia \n\nMalaise, chills, \noedema \nperipheral  \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nInvestigations  Weight \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \ndecreased, \nweight \ndecreased, blood \npressure \nincreased, blood \nsodium \ndecreased, blood \nchloride \ndecreased, \nosteocalcin \nincreased,   \nhaematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased, \ntransaminases \nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications  \n\n  Drug toxicity, \nfall, thermal \nburn  \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nEye and nervous system disorders \nIn patients concomitantly treated with carbamazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate in placebo-\ncontrolled studies, the following adverse reactions were observed: diplopia (11.4% of subjects with \nconcomitant carbamazepine, 2.4% of subjects without concomitant carbamazepine), abnormal \ncoordination (6.7% with concomitant carbamazepine, 2.7% without concomitant carbamazepine), and \ndizziness (30.0% with concomitant carbamazepine, 11.5% without concomitant carbamazepine), see \nsection 4.5. \n \nPR interval \nThe use of eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions \nassociated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. AV block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.  \n \nClass related adverse reactions \nRare adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias did not occur during the placebo-controlled studies of \nthe epilepsy program with eslicarbazepine acetate. However, they have been reported with \noxcarbazepine. Therefore, their occurrence after treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nThere have been reports of decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures in \npatients on long-term therapy with the structurally related antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and \noxcarbazepine. The mechanism by which bone metabolism is affected has not been identified. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged from 2 to 18 years with partial-onset seizures \n(238 patients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate and 189 with placebo), 35.7% of patients treated \nwith eslicarbazepine acetate and 19% of patients treated with placebo experienced adverse reactions. \nThe most common adverse reaction in the group treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia \n(5.0%), somnolence (8.0%) and vomiting (4.6%). \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nThe adverse reaction profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is generally similar across age goups. In the age \ngroup from 6 to 11 years of age, the most common adverse reaction observed in more than two \npatients treated with eslicarbazepine acetate were diplopia (9.5%), somnolence (7.4%), diziness \n(6.3%), convulsion (6.3%) and nausea (3.2%); in the age group from 12 to 18 years were somnolence \n(7.4%), vomiting (4.2%), diplopia (3.2%) and fatigue (3.2%). The safety of Zebinix in children aged 6 \nyears and below has not yet been established. \n \nThe safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was generally similar between adult and paediatric \npatients, except for agitation (common, 1.3%) and abdominal pain (common, 2.1%) which were more \ncommon in children than in adults. Dizziness; somnolence; vertigo; asthenia; gait disturbance; tremor; \nataxia; balance disorder; vision blurred; diarrhoea; rash and hyponatraemia were less common in \nchildren than in adults. Dermatitis allergic (uncommon, 0.8%) was reported only in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \nLong-term safety data in the paediatric population obtained from open label extensions of the phase III \nstudy was consistent with the known safety profile of the product with no new findings of concern. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms observed after an overdose of eslicarbazepine acetate are primarily associated with central \nnervous symptoms (e.g. seizures of all types, status epilepticus) and cardiac disorders (e.g. cardiac \narrhythmia). There is no known specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be \nadministered as appropriate. Eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites can effectively be cleared by \nhaemodialysis, if necessary (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, carboxamide derivatives, ATC code: N03AF04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe precise mechanisms of action of eslicarbazepine acetate are unknown. However, in vitro \nelectrophysiological studies indicate that both eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites stabilise the \ninactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, precludingtheir return to the activated state and \nthereby preventing repetitive neuronal firing.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate and its active metabolites prevented the development of seizures in nonclinical \nmodels predictive of anticonvulsant efficacy in man. In humans, the pharmacological activity of \neslicarbazepine acetate is primarily exerted through the active metabolite eslicarbazepine. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nAdult population \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n81 \n\nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy has been demonstrated in four phase III \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies in 1,703 randomized adult patients with partial epilepsy \nrefractory to treatment with one to three concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products. Oxcarbazepine \nand felbamate were not allowed as concomitant medicinal products in these studies. Eslicarbazepine \nacetate was tested at doses of 400 mg (in -301 and -302 studies only), 800 mg and 1,200 mg, once \ndaily. Eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg once daily and 1,200 mg once daily were significantly more \neffective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency over a 12-week maintenance period. The \npercentage of subjects with ≥50% reduction (1581 analyzed) in seizure frequency in the phase III \nstudies was 19.3% for placebo, 20.8% for eslicarbazepine acetate 400 mg, 30.5% for eslicarbazepine \nacetate 800 mg and 35.3% for eslicarbazepine acetate 1,200 mg daily.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy has been demonstrated in a double-blind, \nactive controlled (carbamazepine controlled release) study, involving 815 randomized adult patients \nwith newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at once-daily doses of \n800 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg. The doses of the active comparator, carbamazepine controlled \nrelease, were 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, twice-daily. All subjects were randomized to the lowest \ndose level and only if a seizure occurred subjects were to be escalated to the next dose level. From the \n815 randomized patients, 401 patients were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily [271 \npatients (67.6%) remained at dose of 800 mg, 70 patients (17.5%) remained at dose of 1,200 mg and \n60 patients (15.0%) were treated with 1,600 mg]. In the primary efficacy analysis, in which drop-outs \nwere considered as non-responders, 71.1% subjects were classified as seizure free in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group and 75.6% in the carbamazepine controlled release group during the \n26 week evaluation period (average risk difference -4.28%, 95% confidence interval: [-10,30; 1,74]. \nThe treatment effect observed during the 26-week evaluation period was maintained over 1 year of \ntreatment with 64.7 % eslicarbazepine acetate subjects and 70.3 % carbamazepine controlled release \nsubjects classified as seizure free (average risk difference -5.46%, 95% confidence interval: [-11.88; \n0.97]. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis and Cox regression), the Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk at the end of the evaluation \nperiod was 0.06 with carbamazepine and 0.12 with eslicarbazepine acetate and by the end of 1 year \nwith an additional increased risk to 0.11 with carbamazepine and 0.19 with eslicarbazepine acetate \n(p=0.0002). \n \nAt 1 year, the probability for subjects to withdraw due to either adverse reactions or lack of efficacy \nwas 0.26 for eslicarbazepine acetate and 0.21 for carbamazepine controlled release.  \n \nThe efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as conversion to monotherapy was evaluated in 2 double-blind, \nrandomized controlled studies in 365 adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Eslicarbazepine acetate \nwas tested at doses of 1,200 mg and 1,600 mg once-daily. Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week \nmonotherapy period were 7.6% (1,600 mg) and 8.3 % (1,200 mg) in one study and 10.0% (1,600 mg) \nand 7.4 % (1,200 mg) in the other study, respectively. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in elderly \npatients were evaluated in one non-controlled study, with a duration of 26 weeks, in 72 elderly (aged \n≥ 65 years). The data shows that the incidence of adverse reactions in this population (65.3 %) is \nsimilar to the general population enrolled in the double-blind epilepsy studies (66.8%).The most \nfrequent individual adverse reactions were dizziness (12.5% of subjects), somnolence (9.7%), fatigue, \nconvulsion and hyponatraemia (8.3%, each), nasopharyngitis (6.9%) and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (5.6%). A total of 50 of the 72 subjects starting the study completed the 26-week treatment \nperiod that corresponds to a retention rate of 69.4% (see section 4.2 for information on elderly use). \nThere is limited data on monotherapy regimen available in the erldely population. Only a few subjects \n(N=27) aged above 65 years were treated with eslicarbazepine acetate in monotherapy study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in \nchildren was evaluated in one phase II study in children aged from 6 to 16 years (N=123) and one \n\n\n\n82 \n\nphase III study in children aged from 2 to 18 years (N=304). Both studies were double-blind and \nplacebo controlled with a duration of maintenance of 8 weeks (study 208) and 12 weeks (study 305), \nrespectively. Study 208 included 2 additional subsequent long-term, open-label extensions (1 year in \npart II and 2 years in part III) and Study 305 included 4 subsequent long-term, open-label extension \nperiods (1 year in Parts II, III and IV and 2 years in Part V). Eslicarbazepine acetate was tested at \ndoses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 1,200 mg/day. The target dose was 30 mg/kg/day \nin study 208 and 20 mg/kg/day in study 305. Doses could be adjusted based on tolerability and \ntreatment response. \n \nIn the double-blind period of the phase II study, evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective, The \nleast square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency from baseline to maintenance period \nwas significantly (p<0.001) higher with eslicarbazepine acetate (-34.8%) compared to placebo (-\n13.8%). Forty-two patients (50.6%) in the eslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 10 patients \n(25.0%) in the placebo group were responders (≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), \nresulting in a significant difference (p=0.009).  \n \nIn the the double-blind period of the phase III study, the least square mean reduction in standardised \nseizure frequency with eslicarbazepine acetate (-18.1% versus baseline) was different to placebo (-\n8.6% versus baseline) but not statistically significant (p=0.2490). Forty-one patients (30.6%) in the \neslicarbazepine acetate group compared to 40 patients (31.0%) in the placebo group were responders \n(≥50% reduction of standardised seizure frequency), resulting in a non-significant difference \n(p=0.9017). Post-hoc subgroup analyses for the phase III study were conducted by age strata and \nabove 6 years, as well as by dose. In children above 6 years, 36 patients (35.0%) in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to 29 patients (30.2%) in the placebo group were responders (p=0.4759) and \nthe least square mean reduction in standardised seizure frequency was higher in the eslicarbazepine \nacetate group compared to placebo (-24.4% versus -10.5%); however, the difference of 13.9% was not \nstatistically significant (p=0.1040). A total of 39% patients in study 305 were up titrated to the \nmaximum possible dose (30 mg/kg/day). Amongst these, when excluding patients aged 6 years and \nyounger, 14 (48.3%) and 11 (30.6%) of patients in the eslicarbazepine acetate and placebo group, \nrespectively, were responders (p=0.1514). Although the robustness of these post-hoc subgroup \nanalyses is limited, the data suggest an age and dose dependent increase in effect size. \n \nIn the subsequent 1-year open-label extension (Part II) of the phase III study (ITT set N=225) the total \nresponder rate was 46.7% (steadily increasing from 44.9% (weeks 1-4) to 57.5% (weeks > 40)). The \ntotal median standardised seizure frequency was 6.1 (decreasing from 7.0 (weeks 1-4) to 4.0 (weeks > \n40), resulting in a median relative change compared to the baseline period of -46.7%). The median \nrelative change was larger in the previous placebo group (-51.4%) than in the previous ESL group (-\n40.4%). The proportion of patients with exacerbation (increase of ≥25%) compared to the baseline \nperiod was 14.2%.  \n \nIn the subsequent 3 open-label extensions (ITT set N=148), the overall responder rate was 26.6% \nwhen compared to baseline Parts III–V (i.e. the last 4 weeks in part II). The total median standardised \nseizure frequency was 2.4 (resulting in a median relative change from Baseline Part III–V of -22.9%). \nThe overall median relative decrease in Part I was greater in patients treated with ESL (-25.8%) than \nin patients treated with placebo (-16.4%). The overall proportion of patients with exacerbation \n(increase of ≥25%) compared to Baseline Parts III–V was 25.7%.   \n \nOf the 183 patients who completed parts I and II of the study, 152 patients were enrolled into part III. \nOf these, 65 patients had received ESL and 87 patients had received placebo during the double-blind \npart of the study. 14 patients (9.2%) completed open-label treatment with ESL through Part V. The \nmost common reason for withdrawal during any part of the study was sponsor request (30 patients in \npart III [19.7% of the patients who entered part III], 9 in part IV [9.6% of the patients who entered part \nIV], and 43 in part V [64.2% of the patients who entered Part V]). \n \nTaking into consideration the limitations of open label uncontrolled data, the long-term response to \neslicarbazepine acetate in the open-label parts of the study was overall maintained. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZebinix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of epilepsy with partial \nonset seizures (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nEslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of eslicarbazepine \nacetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. Eslicarbazepine \nCmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Bioavailability may be assumed as high because the \namount of metabolites recovered in urine corresponded to more than 90% of an eslicarbazepine acetate \ndose.  \n \nDistribution \nThe binding of eslicarbazepine to plasma proteins is relatively low (<40%) and independent from \nconcentration. In vitro studies have shown that plasma protein binding was not relevantly affected by \nthe presence of warfarin, diazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide. The binding of warfarin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, phenytoin and tolbutamide was not significantly affected by the presence of \neslicarbazepine.  \n \nBiotransformation \nEslicarbazepine acetate is rapidly and extensively biotransformed to its major active metabolite \neslicarbazepine by hydrolytic first-pass metabolism. The steady state plasma concentrations are \nattained after 4 to 5 days of once daily dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of \n20-24 hours. In studies in healthy subjects and epileptic adult patients, the apparent half-life of \neslicarbazepine was 10-20 hours and 13-20 hours, respectively. Minor metabolites in plasma are R-\nlicarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, which were shown to be active, and the glucuronic acid conjugates \nof eslicarbazepine acetate, eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine.  \n \nEslicarbazepine acetate does not affect its own metabolism or clearance. \n \nEslicarbazepine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and has inhibiting properties with respect to CYP2C19 \n(as stated in section 4.5). \n \nIn studies with eslicarbazepine in fresh human hepatocytes a mild induction of UGT1A1 mediated \nglucuronidation was observed. \n \nElimination \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion, in the unchanged and glucuronide conjugate forms. In total, eslicarbazepine and its \nglucuronide correspond to more than 90% of total metabolites excreted in urine, approximately two \nthirds in the unchanged form and one third as glucuronide conjugate. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate is linear and dose-proportional in the range \n400-1,200 mg both in healthy subjects and patients. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate is unaffected in the elderly patients with \ncreatinine clearance >60 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nEslicarbazepine acetate metabolites are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal \nexcretion. A study in adult patients with mild to severe renal impairment showed that clearance is \ndependent on renal function. During treatment with Zebinix dose adjustment is recommended in \n\n\n\n84 \n\npatients,adult and children above 6 years of age with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see section \n4.2).  \nIn children from 2 to 6 years of age, the use of eslicarbazepine acetate is not recommended. At this age \nthe intrinsic activity of the elimination process has not yet reached maturation. \n \nHaemodialysis removes eslicarbazepine acetate metabolites from plasma.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of eslicarbazepine acetate were evaluated in healthy subjects \nand moderately liver-impaired patients after multiple oral doses. Moderate hepatic impairment did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate. No dose adjustment is recommended in \npatients with mild to moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2).  \nThe pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  \n \nGender \nStudies in healthy subjects and patients showed that pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate were \nnot affected by gender.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSimilar to adults, eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine. Plasma levels of \neslicarbazepine acetate usually remain below the limit of quantification, following oral administration. \nEslicarbazepine Cmax is attained at 2 to 3 hours post-dose (tmax). Body weight was shown to have an \neffect on volume of distribution and clearance. Furthermore, a role of age independently of weight \nwith regards to clearance of eslicarbazepine acetate could not be excluded, in particular for the \nyoungest age group (2-6 years). \n \nChildren aged 6 years and below \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that in the subgroup of children aged from 2 to 6 years, doses of \n27.5 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day are required in order to achieve exposures that are equivalent to the \ntherapeutic doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years of age. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \nPopulation pharmacokinetics indicate that comparable eslicarbazepine exposure is observed between \n20 and 30 mg/kg/day in children above 6 years old and adults with 800 and 1200 mg of \neslicarbazepine acetate once-daily, respectively (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions observed in animal studies occurred at exposure levels appreciably lower than the \nclinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine (the principal and pharmacologically active metabolite of \neslicarbazepine acetate). Safety margins based on comparative exposure have thus not been \nestablished. \n \nEvidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in repeated dose-toxicity studies in the rat, but was not seen \nin studies in mice or dogs, and is consistent with an exacerbation of spontaneous chronic progressive \nnephropathy in this species.  \n \nLiver centrilobular hypertrophy was seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and rats and an \nincreased incidence of liver tumours was observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice; these findings \nare consistent with an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been \nobserved in patients receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. \n \nJuvenile animals studies \n\n\n\n85 \n\nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile dogs, the toxicity profile was comparable to that observed in adult \nanimals. \nIn the 10-month study decreases in bone mineral content, bone area and/or bone mineral density in \nlumbar vertebrae and/or femur were observed in high-dose female animals at exposure levels lower \nthan the clinical exposure levels to eslicarbazepine in children. \n \nGenotoxicity studies with eslicarbazepine acetate indicate no special hazards for humans. \n \nImpairment of fertility was observed in female rats; decreases in implantations and live embryos seen \nin the mouse fertility study may also indicate effects on female fertility, however, corpora lutea counts \nwere not evaluated. Eslicarbazepine acetate was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit, but did induce \nskeletal abnormalities in the mouse. Ossification delays, reduced foetal weights, an increase in minor \nskeletal and visceral anomalies were observed at maternal toxic doses in embryotoxicity studies in \nmice, rats and rabbits. A delay in the sexual development of the F1 generation was observed in \nperi/postnatal studies in mice and rats. \n \n \n6.

What Zebinix is and what it is used for \n \nZebinix contains the active substance eslicarbazepine acetate. \nZebinix belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics used to treat epilepsy, a condition where \nsomeone has repeated seizures or fits.  \n \nZebinix is used: \n\n• on its own (monotherapy) in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy \n \n\n• with other antiepileptic medicines (adjunctive therapy), in adult, adolescents and children \npatients above 6 years of age who are experiencing seizures that affect one part of the brain \n(partial seizure). These seizures may or may not be followed by a seizure affecting all of the \nbrain (secondary generalisation) \n\n \nZebinix has been given to you by your doctor to reduce your number of seizures. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zebinix \n \nDo not take Zebinix: \n\n• if you are allergic to eslicarbazepine acetate, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. \ncarbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, medicines used to treat epilepsy) or to any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n\n• if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree \natrioventricular (AV) block). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zebinix. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n\n• if you have blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or \nbreathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue. These could be signs \nof an allergic reaction.  \n\n\n\n117 \n\n• if you suffer from confusion, worsening of seizures or decreased consciousness which can be \nsigns of low blood salt levels. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor:  \n\n• if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose. Zebinix is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal disease. \n\n• if you have liver problems. Zebinix is not recommended in patients with severe liver problems. \n• if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) \n\ncalled increased PR interval. If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this \neffect, discuss with your doctor. \n\n• if you suffer from a heart disease such as heart failure or heart attack, or have any heart rhytm \ndisorder. \n\n• if you suffer from seizures that begin with a widespread electric discharge that involves both \nsides of the brain.  \n\n \nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, when taking Zebinix, contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy and/or drowsy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Take \nspecial care when taking Zebinix to avoid accidental injury, such as fall. \n \nTake special care with Zebinix: \nSerious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients treated with Zebinix.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking Zebinix and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n \nIn patients of Han Chinese or Thai origin the risk of serious skin reactions associated with \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be predicted by testing a blood sample of these \npatients. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking Zebinix. \n \nChildren \nZebinix is not to be given to children aged 6 years and below. \n \nOther medicines and Zebinix \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is just in case any of them interfere with how Zebinix works or how Zebinix interferes \nwith their effect.  \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n• phenytoin (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may need to be adjusted; \n• carbamazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may have to be adjusted and the \n\nfollowing side effects of Zebinix may occur in higher frequency: seeing double, abnormal \ncoordination and dizziness; \n\n• hormonal contraceptives (such as the contraceptive pill) since Zebinix may make these less \neffective; \n\n• simvastatin (a medicine used to lower cholesterol levels) since your dose may have to be adjusted; \n• rosuvastatin, a medicine used to lower cholesterol level; \n• the blood thinner - warfarin; \n• tricyclic antidepressants e.g. amitriptyline; \n• do not take oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) with Zebinix, as it is not known \n\nwhether it is safe to take these medicines together. \n \nSee ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ section for advice about contraception. \n \n\n\n\n118 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Research has shown an \nincreased risk of birth defects in children of women taking antiepileptic medicines. On the other hand, \neffective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted since the worsening of the disease is harmful to \nboth the mother and the unborn child.  \n \nDo not breast-feed while you are taking Zebinix. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. \n \nZebinix may make hormonal contraceptives such as the contraceptive pill less effective. Therefore, it \nis recommended that you use other forms of safe and effective contraception, when taking Zebinix up \nto the end of the current menstrual cycle after stopping treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of \ntreatment. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Zebinix \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Zebinix \nDo not stop taking your tablets suddenly. If you do, you are at risk of having more seizures. Your \ndoctor will decide how long you should take Zebinix. Should your doctor decide to stop your \ntreatment with Zebinix your dose will usually be reduced gradually.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1 What Zebinix is and what it is used for \n \nZebinix contains the active substance eslicarbazepine acetate. \nZebinix belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics used to treat epilepsy, a condition where \nsomeone has repeated seizures or fits.  \n \nZebinix is used: \n\n• on its own (monotherapy) in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy \n \n\n• with other antiepileptic medicines (adjunctive therapy), in adult, adolescents and children \npatients above 6 years of age, who are experiencing seizures that affect one part of the brain \n(partial seizure). These seizures may or may not be followed by a seizure affecting all of the \nbrain (secondary generalisation). \n\n \nZebinix has been given to you by your doctor to reduce your number of seizures. \n \n \n2 What you need to know before you take Zebinix \n \nDo not take Zebinix: \n\n• if you are allergic to eslicarbazepine acetate, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. \ncarbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, medicines used to treat epilepsy) or to any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n\n• if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree \natrioventricular (AV) block). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zebinix. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n\n• if you have blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or \nbreathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue. These could be signs \nof an allergic reaction. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n• if you suffer from confusion, worsening of seizures or decreased consciousness which can be \nsigns of low blood salt levels. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor:  \n\n• if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose. Zebinix is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal disease. \n\n• if you have liver problems. Zebinix is not recommended in patients with severe liver problems. \n• if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) \n\ncalled increased PR interval. If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this \neffect, discuss with your doctor. \n\n• if you suffer from a heart disease such as heart failure or heart attack, or have any heart rhytm \ndisorder. \n\n• if you suffer from seizures that begin with a widespread electric discharge that involves both \nsides of the brain. \n\n \nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, when taking Zebinix, contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy and/or drowsy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Take \nspecial care when taking Zebinix to avoid accidental injury, such as fall. \n \nTake special care with Zebinix: \nSerious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients treated with Zebinix.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking Zebinix and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \nIn patients of Han Chinese or Thai origin the risk of serious skin reactions associated with \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be predicted by testing a blood sample of these \npatients. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking Zebinix. \n \nChildren \nZebinix is not to be given to children aged 6 years and below. \n \nOther medicines and Zebinix \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is just in case any of them interfere with how Zebinix works or how Zebinix interferes \nwith their effect. \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n•  phenytoin (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may need to be adjusted; \n• carbamazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may have to be adjusted and the \n\nfollowing side effects of Zebinix may occur in higher frequency: seeing double, abnormal \ncoordination and dizziness; \n\n• hormonal contraceptives (such as the contraceptive pill) since Zebinix may make these less \neffective; \n\n• simvastatin (a medicine used to lower cholesterol levels) since your dose may have to be adjusted; \n• rosuvastatin, a medicine used to lower cholesterol level; \n• the blood thinner - warfarin; \n• tricyclic antidepressants e.g. amitriptyline; \n• do not take oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) with Zebinix, as it is not known \n\nwhether it is safe to take these medicines together. \n \nSee ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ section for advice about contraception. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n\n\n134 \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Research has shown an \nincreased risk of birth defects in children of women taking antiepileptic medicines. On the other hand, \neffective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted since the worsening of the disease is harmful to \nboth the mother and the unborn child.  \n \nDo not breast-feed while you are taking Zebinix. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. \n \nZebinix may make hormonal contraceptives such as the contraceptive pill less effective. Therefore it is \nrecommended that you use other forms of safe and effective contraception, when taking Zebinix up to \nthe end of the current menstrual cycle after stopping treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of \ntreatment. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3 How to take Zebinix \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nAdults \n \nDose when you start treatment \n400 mg once daily for one or two weeks, before increasing to the maintenance dose. Your doctor will \ndecide whether you will be given this dose for one or two weeks.  \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe usual maintenance dose is 800 mg once daily. \nDepending on how you respond to Zebinix, your dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily. If you \nare taking Zebinix on its own your doctor may consider you can benefit of a dose of 1,600 mg once \ndaily. \n \nPatients with kidney problems \nIf you have kidney problems you will usually be given a lower dose of Zebinix. Your doctor will work \nout the correct dose for you. Zebinix is not recommended if you have severe kidney problems. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nIf you are elderly and taking Zebinix on its own the dose of 1,600 mg is not a suitable dose for you. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \n \nDose when you start treatment \nThe starting dose is 10 mg per kg body weight taken once a day for one or two weeks, before \nincreasing to the maintenance dose.  \n \nMaintenance dose \nDepending on the response to Zebinix, the dose may be increased by 10 mg per kg body weight, at \nintervals of one or two weeks, up to 30 mg per kg body weight. The maximum dose is 1,200 mg once \ndaily. \n \nChildren with ≥60 kg \nChildren with 60 kg or more body weight should take the same dose as adults. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nOther form of this medicine, like oral suspension, maybe more suitable for children. Ask your doctor \nor pharmacist. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nZebinix is for oral use. Swallow the tablet with a glass of water.  \nZebinix tablets may be taken with or without food. \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nIf you take more Zebinix than you should \nIf you accidently take more Zebinix than you should, you are potentially at risk of having more \nseizures; or you may feel like your heart beat is irregular or faster. Contact a doctor or go to a hospital \nimmediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. Take the medicine pack with you. This is \nso the doctor knows what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Zebinix \nIf you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember and carry on as usual. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Zebinix \nDo not stop taking your tablets suddenly. If you do, you are at risk of having more seizures. Your \ndoctor will decide how long you should take Zebinix. Should your doctor decide to stop your \ntreatment with Zebinix your dose will usually be reduced gradually. It is important that your treatment \nis completed as advised by your doctor or your symptoms may get worse. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What you need to know before you take Zebinix \n3. How to take Zebinix \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zebinix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zebinix is and what it is used for \n \nZebinix contains the active substance eslicarbazepine acetate. \nZebinix belongs to a group of medicines called antiepileptics used to treat epilepsy, a condition where \nsomeone has repeated seizures or fits.  \n \nZebinix is used: \n\n• on its own (monotherapy) in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy \n \n\n• with other antiepileptic medicines (adjunctive therapy), in adult, adolescents and children \npatients above 6 years of age, who are experiencing seizures that affect one part of the brain \n(partial seizure). These seizures may or may not be followed by a seizure affecting all of the \nbrain (secondary generalisation). \n\n \nZebinix has been given to you by your doctor to reduce your number of seizures. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zebinix \n \nDo not take Zebinix: \n\n• if you are allergic to eslicarbazepine acetate, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. \ncarbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, medicines used to treat epilepsy) or to any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n\n• if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree \natrioventricular (AV) block). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zebinix. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n\n• if you have blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or \nbreathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue. These could be signs \nof an allergic reaction.  \n\n\n\n141 \n\n• if you suffer from confusion, worsening of seizures or decreased consciousness which can be \nsigns of low blood salt levels. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor:  \n\n• if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose. Zebinix is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal disease. \n\n• if you have liver problems. Zebinix is not recommended in patients with severe liver problems. \n• if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) \n\ncalled increased PR interval. If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this \neffect, discuss with your doctor. \n\n• if you suffer from a heart disease such as heart failure or heart attack, or have any heart rhytm \ndisorder. \n\n• if you suffer from seizures that begin with a widespread electric discharge that involves both \nsides of the brain. \n\n \nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, when taking Zebinix, contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy and/or drowsy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Take \nspecial care when taking Zebinix to avoid accidental injury, such as fall. \n \nTake special care with Zebinix: \nSerious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients treated with Zebinix.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking Zebinix and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n \nIn patients of Han Chinese or Thai origin the risk of serious skin reactions associated with \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be predicted by testing a blood sample of these \npatients. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking Zebinix. \n \nChildren \nZebinix is not to be given to children aged 6 years and below. \n \nOther medicines and Zebinix \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is just in case any of them interfere with how Zebinix works or how Zebinix interferes \nwith their effect. \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n• phenytoin (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may need to be adjusted; \n• carbamazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may have to be adjusted and the \n\nfollowing side effects of Zebinix may occur in higher frequency: seeing double, abnormal \ncoordination and dizziness; \n\n• hormonal contraceptives (such as the contraceptive pill) since Zebinix may make these less \neffective; \n\n• simvastatin (a medicine used to lower cholesterol levels) since your dose may have to be adjusted; \n• rosuvastatin, a medicine used to lower cholesterol level; \n• the blood thinner - warfarin; \n• tricyclic antidepressants e.g. amitriptyline; \n• do not take oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) with Zebinix, as it is not known \n\nwhether it is safe to take these medicines together. \n \nSee ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ section for advice about contraception. \n \n\n\n\n142 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Research has shown an \nincreased risk of birth defects in children of women taking antiepileptic medicines. On the other hand, \neffective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted since the worsening of the disease is harmful to \nboth the mother and the unborn child.  \n \nDo not breast-feed while you are taking Zebinix. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. \n \nZebinix may make hormonal contraceptives such as the contraceptive pill less effective. Therefore it is \nrecommended that you use other forms of safe and effective contraception, when taking Zebinix up to \nthe end of the current menstrual cycle after stopping treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of \ntreatment. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Zebinix \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nAdults \n \nDose when you start treatment \n400 mg once daily for one or two weeks, before increasing to the maintenance dose. Your doctor will \ndecide whether you will be given this dose for one or two weeks.  \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe usual maintenance dose is 800 mg once daily. \nDepending on how you respond to Zebinix, your dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily. If you \nare taking Zebinix on its own your doctor may consider you can benefit of a dose of 1,600 mg once \ndaily. \n \nPatients with kidney problems \nIf you have kidney problems you will usually be given a lower dose of Zebinix. Your doctor will work \nout the correct dose for you. Zebinix is not recommended if you have severe kidney problems. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nIf you are elderly and taking Zebinix on its own the dose of 1,600 mg is not a suitable dose for you. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \n \nDose when you start treatment \nThe starting dose is 10 mg per kg body weight taken once a day for one or two weeks, before \nincreasing to the maintenance dose.  \n \nMaintenance dose \nDepending on the response to Zebinix, the dose may be increased by 10 mg per kg body weight, at \nintervals of one one or two weeks, up to 30 mg per kg body weight. The maximum dose is 1,200 mg \nonce daily. \n \nChildren ≥60 kg \nChildren with 60 kg or more body weight should take the same dose as adults. \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \nOther form of this medicine, like oral suspension, maybe more suitable for children. Ask your doctor \nor pharmacist. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nZebinix is for oral use. Swallow the tablet with a glass of water.  \nZebinix tablets may be taken with or without food. \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nIf you take more Zebinix than you should \nIf you accidently take more Zebinix than you should, you are potentially at risk of having more \nseizures; or you may feel like your heart beat is irregular or faster. Contact a doctor or go to a hospital \nimmediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. Take the medicine pack with you. This is \nso the doctor knows what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Zebinix \nIf you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember and carry on as usual. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Zebinix \nDo not stop taking your tablets suddenly. If you do, you are at risk of having more seizures. Your \ndoctor will decide how long you should take Zebinix. Should your doctor decide to stop your \ntreatment with Zebinix your dose will usually be reduced gradually. It is important that your treatment \nis completed as advised by your doctor or your symptoms may get worse. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What you need to know before you take Zebinix \n \nDo not take Zebinix: \n\n• if you are allergic to eslicarbazepine acetate, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. \ncarbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, medicines used to treat epilepsy) or to any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); \n\n• if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree \natrioventricular (AV) block). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zebinix. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n\n• if you have blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or \nbreathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue. These could be signs \nof an allergic reaction.  \n\n\n\n149 \n\n• if you suffer from confusion, worsening of seizures or decreased consciousness which can be \nsigns of low blood salt levels. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor:  \n\n• if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose. Zebinix is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal disease. \n\n• if you have liver problems. Zebinix is not recommended in patients with severe liver problems. \n• if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) \n\ncalled increased PR interval. If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this \neffect, discuss with your doctor. \n\n• if you suffer from a heart disease such as heart failure or heart attack, or have any heart rhytm \ndisorder. \n\n• if you suffer from seizures that begin with a widespread electric discharge that involves both \nsides of the brain.  \n\n \nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing \nthemselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, when taking Zebinix, contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy and/or drowsy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Take \nspecial care when taking Zebinix to avoid accidental injury, such as fall. \n \nTake special care with Zebinix: \nSerious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been \nreported in post-marketing experience in patients treated with Zebinix.  \nIf you develop a serious rash or another skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking Zebinix and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n \nIn patients of Han Chinese or Thai origin the risk of serious skin reactions associated with \ncarbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be predicted by testing a blood sample of these \npatients. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking Zebinix. \n \nChildren \nZebinix is not to be given to children aged 6 years and below. \n \nOther medicines and Zebinix \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is just in case any of them interfere with how Zebinix works or how Zebinix interferes \nwith their effect.  \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n• phenytoin (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may need to be adjusted; \n• carbamazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may have to be adjusted and the \n\nfollowing side effects of Zebinix may occur in higher frequency: seeing double, abnormal \ncoordination and dizziness; \n\n• hormonal contraceptives (such as the contraceptive pill) since Zebinix may make these less \neffective; \n\n• simvastatin (a medicine used to lower cholesterol levels) since your dose may have to be adjusted; \n• rosuvastatin, a medicine used to lower cholesterol level; \n• the blood thinner - warfarin; \n• tricyclic antidepressants e.g. amitriptyline; \n• do not take oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) with Zebinix, as it is not known \n\nwhether it is safe to take these medicines together. \n \nSee ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ section for advice about contraception. \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere are no data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Research has shown an \nincreased risk of birth defects in children of women taking antiepileptic medicines. On the other hand \neffective antiepileptic therapy must not be interrupted since the worsening of the disease is harmful to \nboth the mother and the unborn child.  \n \nDo not breast-feed while you are taking Zebinix. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. \n \nZebinix may make hormonal contraceptives such as the contraceptive pill less effective. Therefore, it \nis recommended that you use other forms of safe and effective contraception, when taking Zebinix up \nto the end of the current menstrual cycle after stopping treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZebinix may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of \ntreatment. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nZebinix contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and sulphites  \nZebinix oral suspension contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed) and sulphites which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions \nand bronchospasm. \n \n \n3. How to take Zebinix \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \n \nAdults \n \nDose when you start treatment \n400 mg once daily for one or two weeks, before increasing to the maintenance dose. Your doctor will \ndecide whether you will be given this dose for one or two weeks.  \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe usual maintenance dose is 800 mg once daily. \nDepending on how you respond to Zebinix, your dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily. If you \nare taking Zebinix on its own your doctor may consider you can benefit of a dose of 1,600 mg once \ndaily. \n \nPatients with kidney problems \nIf you have kidney problems you will usually be given a lower dose of Zebinix. Your doctor will work \nout the correct dose for you. Zebinix is not recommended if you have severe kidney problems. \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \nIf you are elderly and taking Zebinix on its own the dose of 1,600 mg is not a suitable dose for you. \n \nChildren above 6 years of age \n \nDose when you start treatment \nThe starting dose is 10 mg per kg body weight taken once a day for one or two weeks, before \nincreasing to the maintenance dose.  \n \n\n\n\n151 \n\nMaintenance dose \nDepending on the response to Zebinix, the dose may be increased by 10 mg per kg body weight, at \nintervals of one or two weeks, up to 30 mg per kg body weight. The maximum dose is 1,200 mg once \ndaily. \n \nChildren with ≥60 kg \nChildren with 60 kg or more body weight should take the same dose as adults. \n \nOther form of this medicine, like oral suspension, maybe more suitable for children. Ask your doctor \nor pharmacist. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nZebinix is for oral use.  \nZebinix oral suspension may be taken with or without food. \n \nShake well before use. \n \nAlways use the oral syringe provided to take your medicine. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \nStep 1. Remove the bottle, the oral syringe and the bottle adapter from the box  \n \nStep 2. Shake the bottle for at least 10 seconds and remove the child resistant closure by pushing it \ndown and turning it counter-clockwise (to the left). \n \n\n \n \nStep 3. Insert the bottle adapter in the bottle neck opening. You may need to apply some pressure to \ninsert it securely. Once inserted, the bottle adapter must not be removed from the bottle. The bottle can \nbe closed with the closure with the bottle adapter still in place. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n152 \n\nStep 4. To ease the process you should mark the desired volume in the syringe by moving the plunger. \nInsert the tip of the oral syringe into the bottle adapter opening, keeping the bottle upright. Push the \nplunger all the way down. This will create pressure inside the bottle that will help the dosing of the \nsuspension, forcing it to leave from the bottle to the oral syringe. \n \n\n \n \nStep 5: Hold the oral syringe in place and turn the bottle upside down. \nGently pull the plunger of the oral syringe to the desired volume. \n \n\n \n \nStep 6: If you see any air bubbles in the oral syringe, push the plunger upwards just far enough to \ncompletely push out any large air bubbles. Gently pull the plunger back downwards to the dose \nprescribed by your doctor. \n \n\n \n \nStep 7. Turn the bottle upright and remove the entire oral syringe from the bottle. Be careful, do not \npush the plunger down when removing the oral syringe from the bottle. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n \nStep 8. Replace the closure on the bottle by turning it clock-wise (to the right). \n \n\n \n \nStep 9. Place the oral syringe into the mouth against the inside of the cheek. Press the plugger down \nslowly to release Zebinix into the mouth. \n \nStep 10: Rinse the empty oral syringe after each use into a glass of clean water. Repeat this cleaning \nprocess 3 times.  \nStore the bottle and the oral syringe together in the carton until next use. \n \nIf you take more Zebinix than you should \nIf you accidently take more Zebinix than you should, you are potentially at risk of having more \nseizures; or you may feel like your heart beat is irregular or faster. Contact a doctor or go to a hospital \nimmediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. Take the medicine pack with you. This is \nso the doctor knows what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Zebinix \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and carry on as usual. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Zebinix \nDo not stop taking your oral suspension suddenly. If you do, you are at risk of having more seizures. \nYour doctor will decide how long you should take Zebinix. Should your doctor decide to stop your \ntreatment with Zebinix your dose will usually be reduced gradually. It is important that your treatment \nis completed as advised by your doctor or your symptoms may get worse. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n154 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects can be very serious. If they happen to you stop taking Zebinix and tell a \ndoctor or go to a hospital immediately, as you may need urgent medical treatment: \n• blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or breathing \n\nproblems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue.

In addition, there are six post-marketing cases of ‘weight increase’ for \nwhich the causality was assessed as possibly related to eslicarbazepine acetate by the MAH. \nConsidering that changes in body weight can influence the treatment decision and are of particular \nimportance in epilepsy which itself may be associated with overweight/obesity this information \nshould adequately be reflected in SmPC and PIL.  \n\nBased on this outcome, update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add ‘weight increased’ with the \nfrequency common (calculation based on clinical trial data) is recommended.  \n\nOverdose \n\nDuring the reporting period, the MAH detected a signal of overdose. Two clusters of ADRs were \nidentified in context of overdose cases – epilepsy/seizures/status epilepticus and cardiac events, \nmainly arrhythmias. The information currently provided in section 4.9 of the SmPC is limited and \ndoes not reflect a potential cardiac risk of eslicarbazepine acetate overdose or the risk of seizure \ninduction. Based on this outcome, update of section 4.9 to reflect new information from overdose \ncases is recommended. \n\nTherefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to \nthe product information of medicinal products containing eslicarbazepine acetate were warranted. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for eslicarbazepine acetate the CHMP is of the opinion \nthat the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing eslicarbazepine acetate is \nunchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
