Bortezomib Hospira must be reconstituted by \na healthcare professional (see section 6.6).\n\nPosology for treatment of progressive multiple myeloma (patients who have received at least one prior\ntherapy)\nMonotherapy\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in a 21 -day treatment \ncycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. It is recommended that patients receive 2 cycles \nof Bortezomib Hospira following a confirmation of a complete response. It is also recommended that \nresponding patients who do not achieve a complete remission receive a total of 8 cycles of Bortezomib \nHospira therapy. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\n\nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for monotherapy\nBortezomib Hospira treatment must be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 non-haematological or any\nGrade 4 haematological toxicities, excluding neuropathy as discussed below (see also section 4.4). Once \nthe symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, Bortezomib Hospira treatment may be re-initiated at a 25% \nreduced dose (1.3 mg/m2 reduced to 1.0 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 reduced to 0.7 mg/m2). If the toxicity is not \nresolved or if it recurs at the lowest dose, discontinuation of Bortezomib Hospira must be considered\nunless the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risk.\n\nNeuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy\nPatients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy are to be\nmanaged as presented in Table 1 (see section 4.4). Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy may be \ntreated with Bortezomib Hospira only after careful risk/benefit assessment.\n\n\n\n4\n\nTable 1: Recommended* posology modifications for bortezomib-related neuropathy\nSeverity of neuropathy Posology modification\nGrade 1 (asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon \nreflexes or paraesthesia) with no pain or loss of \nfunction\n\nNone\n\nGrade 1 with pain or Grade 2 (moderate \nsymptoms; limiting instrumental Activities of \nDaily Living (ADL)**)\n\nReduce Bortezomib Hospira to 1.0 mg/m2\n\nor\nChange Bortezomib Hospira treatment schedule to \n1.3 mg/m2 once per week\n\nGrade 2 with pain or Grade 3 (severe \nsymptoms; limiting self care ADL***) \n\nWithhold Bortezomib Hospira treatment until \nsymptoms of toxicity have resolved.

This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between \nconsecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\nPegylated liposomal doxorubicin is administered at 30 mg/m\u00b2 on day 4 of the Bortezomib Hospira \ntreatment cycle as a 1 hour intravenous infusion administered after the Bortezomib Hospira injection.\nUp to 8 cycles of this combination therapy can be administered as long as patients have not progressed\nand tolerate treatment. Patients achieving a complete response can continue treatment for at least 2 cycles \nafter the first evidence of complete response, even if this requires treatment for more than 8 cycles. \nPatients whose levels of paraprotein continue to decrease after 8 cycles can also continue for as long as \ntreatment is tolerated and they continue to respond.\nFor additional information concerning pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, see the corresponding Summary \nof Product Characteristics.\n\nCombination with dexamethasone\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21 day treatment \ncycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between \nconsecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of the Bortezomib \nHospira treatment cycle.\nPatients achieving a response or a stable disease after 4 cycles of this combination therapy can continue to \nreceive the same combination for a maximum of 4 additional cycles.\nFor additional information concerning dexamethasone, see the corresponding Summary of Product\nCharacteristics.\n\n\n\n5\n\nDose adjustments for combination therapy for patients with progressive multiple myeloma\nFor Bortezomib Hospira dosage adjustments for combination therapy follow dose modification guidelines\ndescribed under monotherapy above.\n\nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation\nCombination therapy with melphalan and prednisone\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection in combination with oral \nmelphalan and oral prednisone as shown in Table 2. A 6-week period is considered a treatment cycle. In \nCycles 1-4, Bortezomib Hospira is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. In \nCycles 5-9, Bortezomib Hospira is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. At least 72 hours \nshould elapse between consecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\nMelphalan and prednisone should both be given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first week of each\nBortezomib Hospira treatment cycle.\nNine treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered.\n\nTable 2: Recommended posology for Bortezomib Hospira in combination with melphalan and prednisone \nTwice weekly Bortezomib Hospira (cycles 1-4)\n\nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6\nB\n(1.3 mg/m2) \n\nDay \n1\n\n-- -- Day \n4\n\nDay \n8\n\nDay \n11\n\nrest \nperiod\n\nDay \n22\n\nDay \n25\n\nDay \n29\n\nDay \n32\n\nrest \nperiod\n\nM \n(9 mg/m2) \nP \n(60 mg/m2)\n\nDay \n1\n\nDay \n2\n\nDay \n3\n\nDay \n4\n\n-- -- rest \nperiod\n\n-- -- -- -- rest \nperiod\n\nOnce weekly Bortezomib Hospira (cycles 5-9)\nWeek 1 2 3 4 5 6\nB\n(1.3 mg/m2)\n\nDay \n1\n\n-- -- -- Day 8 rest \nperiod\n\nDay 22 Day \n29\n\nrest \nperiod\n\nM \n(9 mg/m2) \nP \n(60 mg/m2)\n\nDay \n1\n\nDay \n2\n\nDay \n3\n\nDay \n4\n\n-- rest \nperiod\n\n-- -- rest \nperiod\n\nB= bortezomib M=melphalan, P=prednisone\n\nDose adjustments during treatment and re-initiation of treatment for combination therapy with melphalan \nand prednisone\nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy:\n\uf0b7 Platelet counts should be \u2265 70 x 109/l and the absolute neutrophils count should be \u2265 1.0 x 109/l\n\uf0b7 Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline\n\nTable 3: Posology modifications during subsequent cycles of Bortezomib Hospira therapy in combination\nwith melphalan and prednisone\n\nToxicity Posology modification or delay\nHaematological toxicity during a cycle \n\n\uf0b7 If prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia or \nthrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia with \nbleeding is observed in the previous cycle\n\nConsider reduction of the melphalan dose by 25% in \nthe next cycle. \n\n\uf0b7 If platelet counts \u2264 30 x 109/l or ANC \u2264 0.75 x Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld \n\n\n\n6\n\nToxicity Posology modification or delay\n109/l on a Bortezomib Hospira dosing day (other \nthan day 1)\n\uf0b7 If several Bortezomib Hospira doses in a cycle \nare withheld (\u2265 3 doses during twice weekly \nadministration or \u2265 2 doses during weekly \nadministration) \n\nBortezomib Hospira dose should be reduced by 1 dose \nlevel (from 1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to \n0.7 mg/m2) \n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities Bortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld until \nsymptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or \nbaseline. Then, Bortezomib Hospira may be \nreinitiated with one dose level reduction (from \n1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to \n0.7 mg/m2). For bortezomib-related neuropathic pain \nand/or peripheral neuropathy, hold and/or modify \nBortezomib Hospira as outlined in Table 1. \n\nFor additional information concerning melphalan and prednisone, see the corresponding Summary of\nProduct Characteristics.\n\nPosology for previously untreated multiple myeloma patients eligible for haematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation (induction therapy)\nCombination therapy with dexamethasone\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in a 21-day treatment \ncycle. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between \nconsecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib \nHospira treatment cycle.\nFour treatment cycles of this combination therapy are administered.\n\nCombination therapy with dexamethasone and thalidomide\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 28-day treatment \ncycle. This 4-week period is considered a treatment cycle. At least 72 hours should elapse between \nconsecutive doses of Bortezomib Hospira.\nDexamethasone is administered orally at 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Bortezomib \nHospira treatment cycle.\nThalidomide is administered orally at 50 mg daily on days 1-14 and if tolerated the dose is increased to \n100 mg on days 15-28, and thereafter may be further increased to 200 mg daily from cycle 2 (see Table 4).\nFour treatment cycles of this combination are administered. It is recommended that patients with at least \npartial response receive 2 additional cycles.\n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 4: Posology for Bortezomib Hospira combination therapy for patients with previously untreated\nmultiple myeloma eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation\nB+Dx Cycles 1 to 4\n\nWeek 1 2 3 \nB (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest Period \nDx 40 mg Day 1, 2, 3, 4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 -\n\nB+Dx+T Cycle 1\nWeek 1 2 3 4 \nB (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest Period Rest Period \nT 50 mg Daily Daily - -\nT 100 mga - - Daily Daily \nDx 40 mg Day 1, 2, 3, 4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 - -\n\nCycles 2 to 4b\n\nB (1.3 mg/m2) Day 1, 4 Day 8, 11 Rest Period Rest Period \nT 200 mga Daily Daily Daily Daily \nDx 40 mg Day 1, 2, 3, 4 Day 8, 9, 10, 11 - -\n\nB=bortezomib; Dx=dexamethasone; T=thalidomide\na Thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg from week 3 of Cycle 1 only if 50 mg is tolerated and to 200 mg \n\nfrom cycle 2 onwards if 100 mg is tolerated.\nb Up to 6 cycles may be given to patients who achieve at least a partial response after 4 cycles\n\nDosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients\nFor Bortezomib Hospira dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy \nshould be followed.\nIn addition, when Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal\nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these products should be considered in the event of toxicities\naccording to the recommendations in the Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nPosology for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)\nCombination therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (BR-CAP)\nBortezomib Hospira is administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection at the recommended dose \nof 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day \nrest period on days 12-21. This 3-week period is considered a treatment cycle. Six Bortezomib Hospira\ncycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional \nBortezomib Hospira cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of \nBortezomib Hospira.\n\nThe following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each Bortezomib Hospira 3 week \ntreatment cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and \ndoxorubicin at 50 mg/m2.\nPrednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Bortezomib Hospira\ntreatment cycle.\n\nDose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma\nPrior to initiating a new cycle of therapy:\n\uf0b7 Platelet counts should be \u2265 100,000 cells/\u03bcL and the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) should be \n\n\u2265 1,500 cells/\u03bcL\n\uf0b7 Platelet counts should be \u2265 75,000 cells/\u03bcL in patients with bone marrow infiltration or splenic \n\nsequestration\n\uf0b7 Haemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL\n\uf0b7 Non-haematological toxicities should have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.\n\n\n\n8\n\nBortezomib Hospira treatment must be withheld at the onset of any \u2265 Grade 3 bortezomib-related \nnon-haematological toxicities (excluding neuropathy) or \u2265 Grade 3 haematological toxicities (see also \nsection 4.4). For dose adjustments, see Table 5 below.\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for haematologic toxicity according to local \nstandard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors should be considered in case \nof repeated delays in cycle administration. Platelet transfusion for the treatment of thrombocytopenia \nshould be considered when clinically appropriate.\n\nTable 5: Dose adjustments during treatment for patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma\n\nToxicity Posology modification or delay\n\nHaematological toxicity\n\n\u2022 \u2265 Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 \nneutropenia lasting more than 7 days, a platelet \ncount < 10,000 cells/\u03bcL\n\nBortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld for up \nto 2 weeks until the patient has an ANC \u2265 750 cells/\u03bcL \nand a platelet count \u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcL.\n\u2022 If, after Bortezomib Hospira has been held, the\ntoxicity does not resolve, as defined above, then \nBortezomib Hospira must be discontinued.\n\u2022 If toxicity resolves i.e. patient has an \nANC \u2265 750cells/\u03bcL and a platelet count \n\u2265 25,000 cells/\u03bcL, Bortezomib Hospira may be \nreinitiated at a dose reduced by one dose level (from \n1.3 mg/m2 to 1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2).\n\n\u2022 If platelet counts < 25,000 cells/\u03bcL or ANC\n< 750 cells/\u03bcL on a Bortezomib Hospira dosing \nday (other than Day 1 of each cycle)\n\nBortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld\n\nGrade \u2265 3 non-haematological toxicities \nconsidered to be related to Bortezomib Hospira\n\nBortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld until \nsymptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 2 or \nbetter. Then, Bortezomib Hospira may be reinitiated at a \ndose reduced by one dose level (from 1.3 mg/m2 to \n1 mg/m2, or from 1 mg/m2 to 0.7 mg/m2). For \nbortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral \nneuropathy, hold and/or modify Bortezomib Hospira as \noutlined in Table 1.\n\nIn addition, when Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic medicinal \nproducts, appropriate dose reductions for these medicinal products should be considered in the event of \ntoxicities, according to the recommendations in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nThere is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustments are necessary in patients over 65 years of age with \nmultiple myeloma or with mantle cell lymphoma.\nThere are no studies on the use of bortezomib in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple\nmyeloma who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\nTherefore no dose recommendations can be made in this population.\nIn a study in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, 42.9% and 10.4% of patients exposed to \nbortezomib were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of age, respectively. In patients aged \u2265 75 years, \nboth regimens, BR-CAP as well as R-CHOP, were less tolerated (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n9\n\nHepatic impairment\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment do not require a dose adjustment and should be treated per the\nrecommended dose. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be started on Bortezomib \nHospira at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m2 per injection during the first treatment cycle, and a subsequent \ndose escalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m2 may be considered based on patient \ntolerability (see Table 6 and sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nTable 6: Recommended starting dose modification for Bortezomib Hospira in patients with hepatic \nimpairment\n\nGrade of hepatic\nimpairment* \n\nBilirubin level \nSGOT (AST) \n\nlevels \nModification of starting dose \n\nMild \n\u2264 1.0 x ULN > ULN None\n\n> 1.0 x -1.5 x ULN Any None\n\nModerate > 1.5 x -3 x ULN Any Reduce Bortezomib Hospira to 0.7 mg/m2 in \nthe first treatment cycle. Consider dose \nescalation to 1.0 mg/m2 or further dose \nreduction to 0.5 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles \nbased on patient tolerability.\n\nSevere > 3 x ULN Any \n\nAbbreviations: SGOT=serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase;\nAST=aspartate aminotransferase; ULN=upper limit of the normal range.\n* Based on NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group classification for categorising hepatic impairment (mild, \n\nmoderate, severe).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are not influenced in patients with mild to moderate renal\nimpairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCL] > 20 ml/min/1.73 m2); therefore, dose adjustments are not \nnecessary for these patients. It is unknown if the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib are influenced in\npatients with severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Since dialysis \nmay reduce bortezomib concentrations, Bortezomib Hospira should be administered after the dialysis\nprocedure (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of bortezomib in children below 18 years of age have not been established (see \nsections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nBortezomib Hospira is available for intravenous or subcutaneous administration.\n\nBortezomib Hospira should not be given by other routes. Intrathecal administration has resulted in death.\n\nIntravenous injection\nBortezomib Hospira reconstituted solution is administered as a 3-5 second bolus intravenous injection\nthrough a peripheral or central intravenous catheter followed by a flush with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml\n(0.9%) solution for injection. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of Bortezomib \nHospira.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSubcutaneous injection\nBortezomib Hospira reconstituted solution is administered subcutaneously through the thighs (right or\nleft) or abdomen (right or left). The solution should be injected subcutaneously, at a 45-90\u00b0 angle.\nInjection sites should be rotated for successive injections.\n\nIf local injection site reactions occur following Bortezomib Hospira subcutaneous injection, either a less\nconcentrated Bortezomib Hospira solution (Bortezomib Hospira to be reconstituted to 1 mg/ml instead of\n2.5 mg/ml) may be administered subcutaneously or a switch to intravenous injection is recommended.\n\nWhen Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to the Summary \nof Product Characteristics of these products for instructions for administration.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to boron or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nAcute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary and pericardial disease.\n\nWhen Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, refer to their \nSummaries of Product Characteristics for additional contraindications.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhen Bortezomib Hospira is given in combination with other medicinal products, the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of these other medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment \nwith Bortezomib Hospira. When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and \nprevention requirements is needed (see section 4.6).\n\nIntrathecal administration\nThere have been fatal cases of inadvertent intrathecal administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib Hospira \nis for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Bortezomib Hospira should not be administered intrathecally.\n\nGastrointestinal toxicity\nGastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation are very common with \nbortezomib treatment. Cases of ileus have been uncommonly reported (see section 4.8). Therefore, \npatients who experience constipation should be closely monitored.\n\nHaematological toxicity\nBortezomib treatment is very commonly associated with haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia, \nneutropenia and anaemia). In studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib \nand in patients with previously untreated MCL treated with bortezomib in combination with rituximab, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP), one of the most common haematologic\ntoxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib \ntreatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. There was no evidence of cumulative \nthrombocytopenia. The mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of baseline in the \nsingle-agent multiple myeloma studies and 50% in the MCL study. In patients with advanced myeloma \nthe severity of thrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts\n< 75,000/\u03bcl, 90% of 21 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl during the study, including 14% < 10,000/\u03bcl; in \ncontrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/\u03bcl, only 14% of 309 patients had a count \u2264 25,000/\u03bcl \nduring the study.\n\n\n\n11\n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of Grade \u2265 3 \nthrombocytopenia in the bortezomib treatment group (BR-CAP) as compared to the non-bortezomib \ntreatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP]). The \ntwo treatment groups were similar with regard to the overall incidence of all-grade bleeding events (6.3% \nin the BR-CAP group and 5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as Grade 3 and higher bleeding events \n(BR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In the BR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients \nreceived platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients in the R-CHOP group.\n\nGastrointestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage, have been reported in association with bortezomib \ntreatment. Therefore, platelet counts should be monitored prior to each dose of Bortezomib Hospira. \nBortezomib Hospira therapy should be withheld when the platelet count is < 25,000/\u03bcl or, in the case of \ncombination with melphalan and prednisone, when the platelet count is \u2264 30,000/\u03bcl (see section 4.2). \nPotential benefit of the treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in case of \nmoderate to severe thrombocytopenia and risk factors for bleeding.\n\nComplete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently \nmonitored throughout treatment with Bortezomib Hospira. Platelet transfusion should be considered when \nclinically appropriate (see section 4.2).\n\nIn patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no \nevidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of bortezomib \ntreatment and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony stimulating \nfactor support was given to 78% of patients in the BR-CAP arm and 61% of patients in the R-CHOP arm. \nSince patients with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered \nfor haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony \nstimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration (see section \n4.2).\n\nHerpes zoster virus reactivation\nAntiviral prophylaxis is recommended in patients being treated with Bortezomib Hospira. \nIn the Phase III study in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma, the overall incidence of \nherpes zoster reactivation was more common in patients treated with bortezomib+melphalan+prednisone \ncompared with melphalan+prednisone (14% versus 4% respectively).\n\nIn patients with MCL (study LYM-3002), the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the \nBR-CAP arm and 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (see section 4.8).\n\nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection\nWhen rituximab is used in combination with Bortezomib Hospira, HBV screening must always be \nperformed in patients at risk of infection with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B \nand patients with a history of hepatitis B must be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of \nactive HBV infection during and following rituximab combination treatment with Bortezomib Hospira. \nAntiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of rituximab \nfor more information.\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\nVery rare cases with unknown causality of John Cunningham (JC) virus infection, resulting in PML and \ndeath, have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib. Patients diagnosed with PML had prior or \nconcurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of their \nfirst dose of bortezomib. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening \nneurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML as part of the differential diagnosis of \n\n\n\n12\n\nCNS problems. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected, patients should be referred to a specialist in PML and \nappropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be initiated. Discontinue Bortezomib Hospira if PML is \ndiagnosed.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy\nTreatment with bortezomib is very commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, which is\npredominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without sensory peripheral\nneuropathy have been reported. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy increases early in the treatment \nand has been observed to peak during cycle 5.\n\nIt is recommended that patients be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy such as a burning\nsensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness.\n\nIn the Phase III study comparing bortezomib administered intravenously versus subcutaneously, the\nincidence of Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% for the subcutaneous injection group and \n41% for the intravenous injection group (p=0.0124). Grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of \npatients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 16% in the intravenous treatment group \n(p=0.0264). The incidence of all grade peripheral neuropathy with bortezomib administered intravenously \nwas lower in the historical studies with bortezomib administered intravenously than in study MMY-3021.\n\nPatients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy should undergo neurological evaluation\nand may require a change in the dose, schedule or route of administration to subcutaneous (see section\n4.2). Neuropathy has been managed with supportive care and other therapies.\n\nEarly and regular monitoring for symptoms of treatment-emergent neuropathy with neurological\nevaluation should be considered in patients receiving Bortezomib Hospira in combination with medicinal\nproducts known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. thalidomide) and appropriate dose reduction or\ntreatment discontinuation should be considered.\n\nIn addition to peripheral neuropathy, there may be a contribution of autonomic neuropathy to some\nadverse reactions such as postural hypotension and severe constipation with ileus. Information on\nautonomic neuropathy and its contribution to these undesirable effects is limited.\n\nSeizures\nSeizures have been uncommonly reported in patients without previous history of seizures or epilepsy.\nSpecial care is required when treating patients with any risk factors for seizures.\n\nHypotension\nBortezomib treatment is commonly associated with orthostatic/postural hypotension. Most adverse\nreactions are mild to moderate in nature and are observed throughout treatment. Patients who developed \northostatic hypotension on bortezomib (injected intravenously) did not have evidence of orthostatic \nhypotension prior to treatment with bortezomib. Most patients required treatment for their orthostatic \nhypotension. A minority of patients with orthostatic hypotension experienced syncopal events. \nOrthostatic/postural hypotension was not acutely related to bolus infusion of bortezomib. The mechanism \nof this event is unknown although a component may be due to autonomic neuropathy. Autonomic \nneuropathy may be related to bortezomib or bortezomib may aggravate an underlying condition such as \ndiabetic or amyloidotic neuropathy. Caution is advised when treating patients with a history of syncope \nreceiving medicinal products known to be associated with hypotension; or who are dehydrated due to \nrecurrent diarrhoea or vomiting. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment \nof antihypertensive medicinal products, rehydration or administration of mineralocorticosteroids and/or \nsympathomimetics. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if they experience symptoms of \ndizziness, light-headedness or fainting spells.\n\n\n\n13\n\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)\nThere have been reports of PRES in patients receiving bortezomib. PRES is a rare, often reversible,\nrapidly evolving neurological condition, which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, lethargy, \nconfusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, preferably Magnetic \nResonance Imaging (MRI), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing PRES, Bortezomib \nHospira should be discontinued.\n\nHeart failure\nAcute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left\nventricular ejection fraction has been reported during bortezomib treatment. Fluid retention may be a\npredisposing factor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Patients with risk factors for or existing heart \ndisease should be closely monitored.\n\nElectrocardiogram investigations\nThere have been isolated cases of QT-interval prolongation in clinical studies, causality has not been\nestablished.\n\nPulmonary disorders\nThere have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown aetiology such as \npneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in \npatients receiving bortezomib (see section 4.8). Some of these events have been fatal. A pre-treatment \nchest radiograph is recommended to serve as a baseline for potential post-treatment pulmonary changes.\n\nIn the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic \nevaluation should be performed and patients treated appropriately. The benefit/risk ratio should be\nconsidered prior to continuing Bortezomib Hospira therapy.\n\nIn a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous \ninfusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia died \nof ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated. Therefore, this specific regimen \nwith concomitant administration with high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 per day) by continuous infusion over \n24 hours is not recommended.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal complications are frequent in patients with multiple myeloma. Patients with renal impairment \nshould be monitored closely (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nBortezomib is metabolised by liver enzymes. Bortezomib exposure is increased in patients with moderate \nor severe hepatic impairment; these patients should be treated with Bortezomib Hospira at reduced doses \nand closely monitored for toxicities (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic reactions\nRare cases of hepatic failure have been reported in patients receiving bortezomib and concomitant \nmedicinal products and with serious underlying medical conditions. Other reported hepatic reactions\ninclude increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hepatitis. Such changes may be reversible \nupon discontinuation of bortezomib (see section 4.8).\n\nTumour lysis syndrome\nBecause bortezomib is a cytotoxic agent and can rapidly kill malignant plasma cells, the complications of \ntumour lysis syndrome may occur. The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high\n\n\n\n14\n\ntumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions \ntaken.\n\nConcomitant medicinal products\nPatients should be closely monitored when given Bortezomib Hospira in combination with potent \nCYP3A4-inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when Bortezomib Hospira is combined with CYP3A4-\nor CYP2C19 substrates (see section 4.5).\n\nNormal liver function should be confirmed and caution should be exercised in patients receiving oral\nhypoglycaemics (see section 4.5).\n\nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions\nPotentially immunocomplex-mediated reactions, such as serum-sickness-type reaction, polyarthritis with \nrash and proliferative glomerulonephritis have been reported uncommonly. Bortezomib Hospira should be\ndiscontinued if serious reactions occur.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 1A2, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism of \nbortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall disposition of \nbortezomib.\n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of\n35% (CI90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely\nmonitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole,\nritonavir).\n\nIn a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of omeprazole, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on the\npharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients.\n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the \npharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction of \n45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong CYP3A4 \ninducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John\u2019s Wort) is not \nrecommended, as efficacy may be reduced.\n\nIn the same drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of dexamethasone, a weaker CYP3A4\ninducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), there was no significant effect on \nthe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 7 patients.\n\nA drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of melphalan-prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of\nbortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data from \n21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.\n\nDuring clinical trials, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia were uncommonly and commonly reported in \ndiabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycaemics. Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving Bortezomib \nHospira treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the dose \nof their antidiabetics.\n\n\n\n15\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nFemale patients of childbearing potential and male patients must use effective contraceptive measures \nduring and for 3 months following treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nNo clinical data are available for bortezomib with regard to exposure during pregnancy. The teratogenic \npotential of bortezomib has not been fully investigated.\n\nIn non-clinical studies, bortezomib had no effects on embryonal/foetal development in rats and rabbits at \nthe highest maternally tolerated doses. Animal studies to determine the effects of bortezomib on \nparturition and post-natal development were not conducted (see section 5.3). Bortezomib Hospira should \nnot be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \nBortezomib Hospira.\nIf Bortezomib Hospira is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this\nmedicinal product, the patient should be informed of potential for hazard to the foetus.\n\nThalidomide is a known human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth\ndefects. Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential unless \nall the conditions of the thalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Patients receiving \nBortezomib Hospira in combination with thalidomide should adhere to the pregnancy prevention\nprogramme of thalidomide. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of thalidomide for additional \ninformation.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether bortezomib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with\nBortezomib Hospira.\n\nFertility\nFertility studies were not conducted with Bortezomib Hospira (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBortezomib Hospira may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Bortezomib \nHospira may be associated with fatigue very commonly, dizziness commonly, syncope uncommonly and \northostatic/postural hypotension or blurred vision commonly. Therefore, patients must be cautious when \ndriving or using machines and should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they experience \nthese symptoms (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nSerious adverse reactions uncommonly reported during treatment with bortezomib include cardiac failure, \ntumour lysis syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, acute \ndiffuse infiltrative pulmonary disorders and rarely autonomic neuropathy. \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with bortezomib are nausea, diarrhoea,\nconstipation, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy \n(including sensory), headache, paraesthesia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, rash, herpes zoster and \nmyalgia.\n\n\n\n16\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nMultiple myeloma\nUndesirable effects in Table 7 were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or probable \ncausal relationship to bortezomib. These adverse reactions are based on an integrated data set of 5,476 \npatients of whom 3,996 were treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 and included in Table 7.\nOverall, bortezomib was administered for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 3,974 patients.\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined \nas: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. Table 7 has been generated using Version 14.1 of the MedDRA.\nPost-marketing adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials are also included.\n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions in patients with multiple

Post-marketing adverse reaction regardless of indication\n\nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL)\nThe safety profile of bortezomib in 240 MCL patients treated with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 in \ncombination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP) versus 242 \npatients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP] \nwas relatively consistent to that observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main differences \ndescribed below. Additional adverse drug reactions identified associated with the use of the combination \ntherapy (BR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection (< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia (1.3%). The similar \nincidences of these events in both treatment arms, indicated that these adverse drug reactions are not \nattributable to bortezomib alone. Notable differences in the MCL patient population as compared to \npatients in the multiple myeloma studies were a \u2265 5% higher incidence of the haematological adverse \nreactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anaemia, lymphopenia), peripheral sensory \nneuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair disorders.\nAdverse drug reactions identified as those with a \u2265 1% incidence, similar or higher incidence in the \nBR-CAP arm and with at least a possible or probable causal relationship to the components of the \nBR-CAP arm, are listed in Table 8 below. Also included are adverse drug reactions identified in the \nBR-CAP arm that were considered by investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal \nrelationship to bortezomib based on historical data in the multiple myeloma studies.\n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency grouping.

The incidence of herpes \nzoster among patients in the B+M+P treatment group was 17% for patients not administered antiviral \nprophylaxis compared to 3% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis.\n\nMantle cell lymphoma\nAntiviral prophylaxis was administered to 137 of 240 patients (57%) in the BR-CAP arm. The incidence \nof herpes zoster among patients in the BR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients not administered antiviral \nprophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation and infection\nMantle cell lymphoma\nHBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-bortezomib treatment \ngroup (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP) and 0.4% (n=1) \nof patients receiving bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and \nprednisone (BR-CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was similar in patients treated with \nBR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively).\n\nPeripheral neuropathy in combination regimens\nMultiple myeloma\nIn trials in which bortezomib was administered as induction treatment in combination with dexamethasone \n(study IFM-2005-01), and dexamethasone-thalidomide (study MMY-3010), the incidence of peripheral \nneuropathy in the combination regimens is presented in the table below:\n\nTable 9: Incidence of peripheral neuropathy during induction treatment by toxicity and treatment \ndiscontinuation due to peripheral neuropathy\n\nIFM-2005-01 MMY-3010\nVDDx\n\n(N=239)\nBDx\n\n(N=239)\nTDx\n\n(N=126)\nBTDx\n\n(N=130)\nIncidence of PN (%)\nAll Grade PN 3 15 12 45 \n\u2265 Grade 2 PN 1 10 2 31 \n\u2265 Grade 3 PN < 1 5 0 5 \nDiscontinuation due to PN (%) < 1 2 1 5 \nVDDx=vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone; BDx=bortezomib, dexamethasone; TDx=thalidomide, \ndexamethasone;\nBTDx=bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone; PN=peripheral neuropathy\nNote: Peripheral neuropathy included the preferred terms: neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor neuropathy, \nperipheral sensory neuropathy, and polyneuropathy.\n\n\n\n23\n\nMantle cell lymphoma\nIn study LYM-3002 in which bortezomib was administered with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CAP), the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the combination \nregimens is presented in the table below:\n\nTable 10: Incidence of peripheral neuropathy in study LYM-3002 by toxicity and treatment \ndiscontinuation due to peripheral neuropathy\n\nBR-CAP\n(N=240)\n\nR-CHOP\n(N=242)\n\nIncidence of PN (%)\n\nAll Grade PN 30 29\n\n\u2265 Grade 2 PN 18 9\n\n\u2265 Grade 3 PN 8 4\n\nDiscontinuation due to PN (%) 2 < 1\n\nBR-CAP= bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone; R-CHOP= rituximab, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; PN=peripheral neuropathy\n\nPeripheral neuropathy included the preferred terms: peripheral sensory neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, \nperipheral motor neuropathy, and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy\n\nElderly MCL patients\n42.9% and 10.4% of patients in the BR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 years and \u2265 75 years of age, \nrespectively. Although in patients aged \u2265 75 years, both BR-CAP and R-CHOP were less tolerated, the \nserious adverse event rate in the BR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the R-CHOP group.\n\nNotable differences in the safety profile of bortezomib administered subcutaneously versus intravenously \nas single agent\nIn the Phase III study patients who received bortezomib subcutaneously compared to intravenous\nadministration had 13% lower overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse reactions that were Grade \n3 or higher in toxicity, and a 5% lower incidence of discontinuation of bortezomib. The overall incidence \nof diarrhoea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, asthenic conditions, upper respiratory tract infections \nand peripheral neuropathies were 12%-15% lower in the subcutaneous group than in the intravenous \ngroup. In addition, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathies was 10% lower, and the \ndiscontinuation rate due to peripheral neuropathies 8% lower for the subcutaneous group as compared to \nthe intravenous group.\n\nSix percent of patients had an adverse local reaction to subcutaneous administration, mostly redness.\nCases resolved in a median of 6 days, dose modification was required in two patients. Two (1%) of the\npatients had severe reactions; 1 case of pruritus and 1 case of redness.\n\nThe incidence of death on treatment was 5% in the subcutaneous treatment group and 7% in the\nintravenous treatment group. Incidence of death from \u201cProgressive disease\u201d was 18% in the subcutaneous \ngroup and 9% in the intravenous group.\n\nRetreatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma\nIn a study in which bortezomib retreatment was administered in 130 patients with relapsed multiple\nmyeloma, who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing regimen, the most\ncommon all-grade adverse events occurring in at least 25% of patients were thrombocytopenia (55%),\n\n\n\n24\n\nneuropathy (40%), anaemia (37%), diarrhoea (35%), and constipation (28%). All grade peripheral\nneuropathy and grade \u2265 3 peripheral neuropathy were observed in 40% and 8.5% of patients, respectively.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn patients, overdose more than twice the recommended dose has been associated with the acute onset of \nsymptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcomes. For preclinical cardiovascular safety \npharmacology studies, see section 5.3.\n\nThere is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient\u2019s \nvital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood pressure (such as \nfluids, pressors, and/or inotropic agents) and body temperature (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX32.\n\nMechanism of action\nBortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity \nof the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades \nubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the turnover \nof specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome \nprevents this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately \nresulting in cancer cell death.\n\nBortezomib is highly selective for the proteasome. At 10 \u00b5M concentrations, bortezomib does not inhibit \nany of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened and is more than 1,500-fold more selective for \nthe proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The kinetics of proteasome inhibition were evaluated \nin vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the proteasome with a t\u00bd of 20 minutes, thus \ndemonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible.\n\nBortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but not \nlimited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor kappa B \n(NF-kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. NF-kB is a \ntranscription factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, including cell growth \nand survival, angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, bortezomib affects the \nability of myeloma cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.\n\nExperiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types and that\ncancer cells are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells.\nBortezomib causes reduction of tumour growth in vivo in many preclinical tumour models, including\nmultiple myeloma.\n\n\n\n25\n\nData from in vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models with bortezomib suggest that it increases osteoblast\ndifferentiation and activity and inhibits osteoclast function. These effects have been observed in patients \nwith multiple myeloma affected by an advanced osteolytic disease and treated with bortezomib.\n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated multiple myeloma\nA prospective Phase III, international, randomised (1:1), open-label clinical study (MMY-3002 VISTA) of \n682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected intravenously) in \ncombination with melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) resulted in improvement in time to \nprogression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) in patients with \npreviously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a maximum of 9 cycles \n(approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nThe median age of the patients in the study was 71 years, 50% were male, 88% were Caucasian and the \nmedian Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80. Patients had IgG/IgA/Light chain \nmyeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median haemoglobin of 105 g/l, and a median platelet count of \n221.5 x 109/l. Similar proportions of patients had creatinine clearance \u2264 30 ml/min (3% in each arm).\n\nAt the time of a pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint, time to progression, was met and\npatients in the M+P arm were offered B+M+P treatment. Median follow-up was 16.3 months. The final \nsurvival update was performed with a median duration of follow-up of 60.1 months. A statistically \nsignificant survival benefit in favour of the B+M+P treatment group was observed (HR=0.695; \np=0.00043) despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib-based regimens. Median survival for the \nB+M+P treatment group was 56.4 months compared to 43.1 for the M+P treatment group.

Patients in the BDx group received four 21 day \ncycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered intravenously twice weekly on days \n1, 4, 8, and 11), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1 to 4 and days 9 to 12, in Cycles 1 and 2, \nand on days 1 to 4 in Cycles 3 and 4).\nAutologous stem cell transplants were received by 198 (82%) patients and 208 (87%) patients in the\nVDDx and BDx groups respectively; the majority of patients underwent one single transplant procedure. \nPatient demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. \nMedian age of the patients in the study was 57 years, 55% were male and 48% of patients had high-risk \ncytogenetics. The median duration of treatment was 13 weeks for the VDDx group and 11 weeks for the \nBDx group. The median number of cycles received for both groups was 4 cycles.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was post-induction response rate (CR+nCR). A statistically\nsignificant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the bortezomib combined with\ndexamethasone group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included post-transplant response rates (CR+nCR, \nCR+nCR+VGPR+PR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival.

Patients in the BTDx group \nreceived six 4-week cycles, each consisting of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 administered twice weekly days \n1, 4, 8, and 11, followed by a 17-day rest period from day 12 to day 28), dexamethasone (40 mg \nadministered orally on days 1 to 4 and days 8 to 11), and thalidomide (administered orally at 50 mg daily \non days 1-14, increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and thereafter to 200 mg daily).\nOne single autologous stem cell transplant was received by 105 (81%) patients and 78 (61%) patients in \nthe BTDx and TDx groups, respectively. Patient demographic and baseline disease characteristics were \nsimilar between the treatment groups. Patients in the BTDx and TDx groups respectively had a median \nage of 57 versus 56 years, 99% versus 98% patients were Caucasians, and 58% versus 54% were males. In \nthe BTDx group 12% of patients were cytogenetically classified as high risk versus 16% of patients in the \nTDx group. The median duration of treatment was 24.0 weeks and the median number of treatment cycles \nreceived was 6.0, and was consistent across treatment groups.\nThe primary efficacy endpoints of the study were post-induction and post-transplant response rates\n(CR+nCR). A statistically significant difference in CR+nCR was observed in favour of the bortezomib \ncombined with dexamethasone and thalidomide group.

As a result of a pre-planned interim analysis, the dexamethasone arm was halted at the\nrecommendation of the data monitoring committee and all patients randomised to dexamethasone were\nthen offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. Due to this early crossover, the median duration of \nfollow-up for surviving patients is 8.3 months. Both in patients who were refractory to their last prior \ntherapy and those who were not refractory, overall survival was significantly longer and response rate was \nsignificantly higher on the bortezomib arm.\n\nOf the 669 patients enrolled, 245 (37%) were 65 years of age or older. Response parameters as well as\nTTP remained significantly better for bortezomib independently of age. Regardless of \u03b22-microglobulin \nlevels at baseline, all efficacy parameters (time to progression and overall survival, as well as response \nrate) were significantly improved on the bortezomib arm.\n\nIn the refractory population of the Phase II study, responses were determined by an independent review\ncommittee and the response criteria were those of the European Bone Marrow Transplant Group. The \nmedian survival of all patients enrolled was 17 months (range < 1 to 36+ months). This survival was \ngreater than the six-to-nine month median survival anticipated by consultant clinical investigators for a \nsimilar patient population. By multivariate analysis, the response rate was independent of myeloma type, \n\n\n\n29\n\nperformance status, chromosome 13 deletion status, or the number or type of previous therapies. Patients \nwho had received 2 to 3 prior therapeutic regimens had a response rate of 32% (10/32) and patients who \nreceived greater than 7 prior therapeutic regimens had a response rate of 31% (21/67).\n\nTable 14: Summary of disease outcomes from the Phase III (APEX) and Phase II studies\nPhase III Phase III Phase III Phase II\n\nAll patients\n1 prior line of \n\ntherapy\n> 1 prior line of \n\ntherapy\n\u2265 2 prior \n\nlines\nTime related \nevents \n\nB\nn=333a\n\nDex\nn=336 a\n\nB\nn=132 a\n\nDex\nn=119 a\n\nB\nn=200 a\n\nDex\nn=217 a\n\nB\nn=202 a\n\nTTP, days \n[95% CI] \n\n189b\n\n[148, \n211]\n\n106b\n\n[86, \n128]\n\n212d\n\n[188, 267]\n169d\n\n[105, 191]\n148b\n\n[129, 192]\n\n87b\n\n[84, \n107]\n\n210\n[154, 281]\n\n1 year survival, \n% [95% CI] \n\n80d \n[74,85]\n\n66d \n[59,72]\n\n89d \n[82,95]\n\n72d \n[62,83]\n\n73 \n[64,82]\n\n62 \n[53,71]\n\n60\n\nBest response \n(%)\n\nB\nn=315c\n\nDex\nn=312c\n\nB\nn=128\n\nDex\nn=110\n\nB\nn=187\n\nDex\nn=202\n\nB\nn=193\n\nCR 20 (6)b 2 (< 1)b 8 (6) 2 (2) 12 (6) 0 (0) (4)**\nCR+nCR 41 (13)b 5 (2)b 16 (13) 4 (4) 25 (13) 1 (< 1) (10)**\nCR+nCR+PR 121 (38)b 56 (18)b 57 (45)d 29 (26)d 64 (34)b 27 (13)b (27)**\nCR+nCR+ \nPR+MR \n\n146 (46) 108 (35) 66 (52) 45 (41) 80 (43) 63 (31) (35)**\n\nMedian \nduration Days \n(months) 242 (8.0)\n\n169 \n(5.6) 246 (8.1) 189 (6.2) 238 (7.8)\n\n126 \n(4.1) 385*\n\nTime to \nresponse \nCR+PR (days) 43 43 44 46 41 27 38*\na Intent to Treat (ITT) population\nb p-value from the stratified log-rank test; analysis by line of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic \n\nhistory; p < 0.0001\nc Response population includes patients who had measurable disease at baseline and received at least 1 dose of \n\nstudy medicinal product.\nd p-value from the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test adjusted for the stratification factors; analysis by \n\nline of therapy excludes stratification for therapeutic history\n* CR+PR+MR **CR=CR, (IF-); nCR=CR (IF+)\nNA=not applicable, NE=not estimated\nTTP-Time to Progression\nCI=Confidence Interval\nB=bortezomib; Dex=dexamethasone\nCR=Complete Response; nCR=near Complete response\nPR=Partial Response; MR=Minimal response\n\nIn the Phase II study, patients who did not obtain an optimal response to therapy with bortezomib alone \nwere able to receive high-dose dexamethasone in conjunction with bortezomib. The protocol allowed \npatients to receive dexamethasone if they had had a less than optimal response to bortezomib alone. A \ntotal of 74 evaluable patients were administered dexamethasone in combination with bortezomib. Eighteen \npercent of patients achieved, or had an improved response [MR (11%) or PR (7%)] with combination \ntreatment.\n\n\n\n30\n\nClinical efficacy with subcutaneous administration of bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory \nmultiple myeloma\nAn open label, randomised, Phase III non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of the\nsubcutaneous administration of bortezomib versus the intravenous administration. This study included 222 \npatients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, who were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive\n1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib by either the subcutaneous or intravenous route for 8 cycles. Patients who did \nnot obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response [CR]) to therapy with bortezomib alone after \n4 cycles were allowed to receive dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after bortezomib \nadministration. Patients with baseline Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts < 50,000/\u03bcl were \nexcluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response.\n\nThis study met its primary objective of non-inferiority for response rate (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of single \nagent bortezomib for both the subcutaneous and intravenous routes, 42% in both groups. In addition, \nsecondary response-related and time to event related efficacy endpoints showed consistent results for \nsubcutaneous and intravenous administration (Table 15).\n\nTable 15: Summary of efficacy analyses comparing subcutaneous and intravenous administrations of \nbortezomib \n\nBortezomib intravenous \narm\n\nBortezomib \nsubcutaneous arm \n\nResponse Evaluable Population n=73 n=145\nResponse Rate at 4 cycles n (%) \nORR (CR+PR)\n\n31 (42) 61 (42)\n\np-valuea 0.00201\nCR n (%) 6 (8) 9 (6)\nPR n (%) 25 (34) 52 (36)\nnCR n (%) 4 (5) 9 (6)\nResponse Rate at 8 cycles n (%) \nORR (CR+PR) 38 (52) 76 (52)\np-valuea 0.0001\nCR n (%) 9 (12) 15 (10)\nPR n (%) 29 (40) 61 (42)\nnCR n (%) 7 (10) 14 (10)\nIntent to Treat Populationb n=74 n=148\nTTP, months 9.4 10.4\n(95% CI) (7.6, 10.6)            (8.5, 11.7)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)c \n\np-valued\n0.839 (0.564, 1.249)\n\n0.38657\nProgression Free Survival, months 8.0 10.2\n(95% CI) (6.7, 9.8) (8.1, 10.8)\nHazard ratio (95% CI)c\n\np-valued\n0.824 (0.574, 1.183)\n\n0.295\n\n1-year Overall Survival (%)e 76.7 72.6\n(95% CI) (64.1, 85.4) (63.1, 80.0)\n\na p-value is for the non-inferiority hypothesis that the SC arm retains at least 60% of the response rate in the IV \narm.\n\nb 222 subjects were enrolled into the study; 221 subjects were treated with bortezomib \nc Hazards ratio estimate is based on a Cox model adjusted for stratification factors: ISS staging and number of \n\nprior lines.\nd Log rank test adjusted for stratification factors: ISS staging and number of prior lines.\ne Median duration of follow up is 11.8 months\n\n\n\n31\n\nBortezomib combination treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (study DOXIL-MMY-3001)\nA Phase III randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 646 patients\ncomparing the safety and efficacy of bortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus bortezomib \nmonotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 prior therapy and who did not \nprogress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was TTP while the \nsecondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR (CR+PR), using the European Group for Blood and \nMarrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.\nA protocol-defined interim analysis (based on 249 TTP events) triggered early study termination for\nefficacy. This interim analysis showed a TTP risk reduction of 45 % (95 % CI; 29-57 %, p < 0.0001) for \npatients treated with combination therapy of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The\nmedian TTP was 6.5 months for the bortezomib monotherapy patients compared with 9.3 months for the \nbortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients. These results, though not \nmature, constituted the protocol defined final analysis.\n\nThe final analysis for OS performed after a median follow-up of 8.6 years showed no significant \ndifference in OS between the two treatment arms. The median OS was 30.8 months (95% CI; 25.2-36.5 \nmonths) for the bortezomib monotherapy patients and 33.0 months (95% CI; 28.9-37.1 months) for the \nbortezomib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination therapy patients.\n\nBortezomib combination treatment with dexamethasone\nIn the absence of any direct comparison between bortezomib and bortezomib in combination with\ndexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma, a statistical matched-pair analysis was\nconducted to compare results from the non randomised arm of bortezomib in combination with\ndexamethasone (Phase II open-label study MMY-2045), with results obtained in the bortezomib \nmonotherapy arms from different Phase III randomised studies (M34101-039 [APEX] and DOXIL\nMMY-3001) in the same indication.\nThe matched-pair analysis is a statistical method in which patients in the treatment group (e.g. bortezomib \nin combination with dexamethasone) and patients in the comparison group (e.g. bortezomib) are made \ncomparable with respect to confounding factors by individually pairing study subjects. This minimises the \neffects of observed confounders when estimating treatment effects using non-randomised data.\nOne hundred and twenty seven matched pairs of patients were identified. The analysis demonstrated \nimproved ORR (CR+PR) (odds ratio 3.769; 95% CI 2.045-6.947; p < 0.001), PFS (hazard ratio 0.511;95% \nCI 0.309-0.845; p=0.008), TTP (hazard ratio 0.385; 95% CI 0.212-0.698; p=0.001) for bortezomib in \ncombination with dexamethasone over bortezomib monotherapy.\n\nLimited information on bortezomib retreatment in relapsed multiple myeloma is available.\nPhase II study MMY-2036 (RETRIEVE), single arm, open-label study was conducted to determine the \nefficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (\u2265 18 years of age) \nwith multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib -containing regimen \nwere retreated upon progression. At least 6 months after prior therapy, bortezomib was started at the last \ntolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m2 (n=93) or \u2264 1.0 mg/m2 (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks \nfor maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with \nthe standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in combination with bortezomib to 83 patients in \nCycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of bortezomib \nretreatment cycles.\n\nThe primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by EBMT criteria. The \noverall best response rate (CR + PR), to retreatment in 130 patients was 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4).\n\nClinical efficacy in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)\nStudy LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of the \ncombination of bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (BR-CAP; \n\n\n\n32\n\nn=243) to that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP; \nn=244) in adult patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in the BR-CAP \ntreatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days 12-21), rituximab \n375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; \nand prednisone 100 mg/m2 orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day bortezomib treatment cycle. For \npatients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional treatment cycles were given.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival based on Independent Review Committee \n(IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included, time to progression (TTP), time to next anti-lymphoma \ntreatment (TNT), duration of treatment free interval (TFI), overall response rate (ORR) and complete \nresponse (CR/CRu) rate, overall survival (OS) and response duration.\n\nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two \ntreatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% Asian, \n69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for MCL, 54% \nof patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of \u2265 3, and 76% had Stage IV disease. \nTreatment duration (median=17 weeks) and duration of follow-up (median=40 months) were comparable \nin both treatment arms. A median of 6 cycles was received by patients in both treatment arms with 14% of \nsubjects in the BR-CAP group and 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group receiving 2 additional cycles. \nThe majority of the patients in both groups completed treatment, 80% in the BR-CAP group and 82% in \nthe R-CHOP group.

A statistically significant benefit (p < 0.001) in favour \nof the BR-CAP treatment group over the R-CHOP group was observed for TTP (median 30.5 versus 16.1 \nmonths), TNT (median 44.5 versus 24.8 months) and TFI (median 40.6 versus 20.5 months). The median \nduration of complete response was 42.1 months in the BR-CAP group compared with 18 months in the R-\nCHOP group. The duration of overall response was 21.4 months longer in the BR-CAP group (median \n36.5 months versus 15.1 months in the R-CHOP group). With a median duration of follow-up of 40 \nmonths, median OS (56.3 months in the R-CHOP group, and not reached in the BR-CAP group) favoured \nthe BR-CAP group, (estimated HR=0.80; p=0.173). There was a trend towards prolonged overall survival \nfavouring the BR-CAP group; the estimated 4-year survival rate was 53.9% in the R-CHOP group and \n64.4% in the BR-CAP group.\n\nPatients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis\nAn open label non randomised Phase I/II study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of\nbortezomib in patients with previously treated light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis. No new safety concerns \nwere observed during the study, and in particular bortezomib did not exacerbate target organ damage\n(heart, kidney and liver). In an exploratory efficacy analysis, a 67.3% response rate (including a 28.6% CR \nrate) as measured by hematologic response (M-protein) was reported in 49 evaluable patients treated with \nthe maximum allowed doses of 1.6 mg/m2 weekly and 1.3 mg/m2 twice-weekly. For these dose cohorts, \nthe combined 1-year survival rate was 88.1%.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nA Phase II, single-arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children\u2019s Oncology \nGroup assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re induction chemotherapy in \npaediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia \n[ALL], T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective reinduction multiagent \nchemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Bortezomib was administered only in Blocks 1 and \n2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered medicinal product in Block 3.\n\nComplete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 18 \nmonths of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free survival rate \nwas 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 33) the CR \nrate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% (95% CI: 54, 85). The \nCR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 86) and the 4-month event \nfree survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are considered inconclusive (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nThere were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years \n(range 1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to the standard \npaediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade \u2265 3) were \nobserved at a higher incidence in the bortezomib containing treatment regimen as compared with a \nhistorical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory\nneuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on \npossible sequelae or rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher \nincidences were also noted for infections with Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and \n22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 6% \nin Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% \nversus 0 in Block 2).\n\n\n\n34\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing bortezomib in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple \nmyeloma and in mantle cell lymphoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose to 11 patients with \nmultiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/min, the mean first-dose maximum \nplasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ml, respectively. In subsequent doses, mean \nmaximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/ml for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to \n120 ng/ml for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.\n\nFollowing an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m2 dose to patients with multiple \nmyeloma (n=14 in the intravenous group, n=17 in the subcutaneous group), the total systemic exposure \nafter repeat dose administration (AUClast) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous\nadministrations. The Cmax after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/ml) was lower than intravenous\n(223 ng/ml). The AUClast- geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence intervals were\n80.18%-122.80%.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean distribution volume (Vd) of bortezomib ranged from 1,659 l to 3,294 l following single- or\nrepeated-dose intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2 to patients with multiple myeloma. \nThis suggests that bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. Over a bortezomib concentration \nrange of 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, the in vitro protein binding averaged 82.9% in human plasma. The fraction of \nbortezomib bound to plasma proteins was not concentration-dependent.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes\nindicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolised via cytochrome P450 enzymes, 3A4, 2C19, \nand 1A2. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form two deboronated metabolites that \nsubsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated-bortezomib metabolites are \ninactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors.\n\nElimination\nThe mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40-193 hours.\nBortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose compared to subsequent doses. Mean total \nbody clearances were 102 and 112 l/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, \nrespectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/h and 18 to 32 l/h following subsequent doses for doses of \n1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.\n\nSpecial populations\nHepatic impairment\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib was assessed in a Phase I study \nduring the first treatment cycle, including 61 patients primarily with solid tumors and varying degrees of \nhepatic impairment at bortezomib doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/m2.\n\nWhen compared to patients with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment did not alter\ndose-normalised bortezomib AUC. However, the dose-normalised mean AUC values were increased by \napproximately 60% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose is \nrecommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and those patients should be\nclosely monitored (see section 4.2, Table 6).\n\n\n\n35\n\nRenal impairment\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal impairment who were\nclassified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCL) into the following groups: Normal \n(CrCL \u2265 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL = 40-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate (CrCL = 20-\n39 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, n=3). A group of dialysis patients who \nwere dosed after dialysis was also included in the study (n=8). Patients were administered intravenous \ndoses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of bortezomib (dose-normalised AUC \nand Cmax) was comparable among all the groups (see section 4.2).\n\nAge\nThe pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus\nadministration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 paediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic\nleukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis,\nclearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV)\nclearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the\nelimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics such \nas age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib clearance. \nBSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nBortezomib was positive for clastogenic activity (structural chromosomal aberrations) in the in vitro\nchromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations as low as \n3.125 \u03bcg/ml, which was the lowest concentration evaluated. Bortezomib was not genotoxic when tested in \nthe in vitro mutagenicity assay (Ames assay) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit have shown embryo-fetal lethality at maternally toxic \ndoses, but no direct embryo-foetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses. Fertility studies were not \nperformed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity studies. In the \n6-month rat study, degenerative effects in both the testes and the ovary have been observed. It is, \ntherefore, likely that bortezomib could have a potential effect on either male or female fertility. Peri- and \npostnatal development studies were not conducted.\n\nIn multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs\nincluded the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/or diarrhoea; haematopoietic and lymphatic \ntissues, resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and haematopoietic bone \nmarrow hypocellularity; peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and dogs) involving sensory \nnerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys. All these target organs have shown partial to full recovery \nfollowing discontinuation of treatment.\n\nBased on animal studies, the penetration of bortezomib through the blood-brain barrier appears to be\nlimited, if any and the relevance to humans is unknown.\n\nCardiovascular safety pharmacology studies in monkeys and dogs show that intravenous doses\napproximately two to three times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis are associated with\nincreases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension and death. In dogs, the decreased cardiac\ncontractility and hypotension responded to acute intervention with positive inotropic or pressor agents.\nMoreover, in dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed.\n\n\n\n36\n\n6.

starting dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week. your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver problems). progressive multiple myeloma when bortezomib is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 10-day 'rest period' without treatment. this 21-day period (3 weeks) corresponds to one treatment cycle. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). you may also be given bortezomib together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone. when bortezomib is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 is given on day 4 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after the bortezomib injection. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). when bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, of the bortezomib, 21-day treatment cycle. you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). previously untreated multiple myeloma if you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with two other medicines; melphalan and prednisone. in this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). you will receive 9 cycles (54 weeks). in cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32. in cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first week of each cycle. if you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment. when bortezomib is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle. you will receive 4 cycles (12 weeks). when bortezomib is given together with thalidomide and dexamethasone, the duration of a treatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the bortezomib 28-day treatment cycle and thalidomide is given orally daily at 50 mg up to day 14 of the first cycle, and if tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards. you might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks). previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma if you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma, you will receive bortezomib intravenously or subcutaneously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone. bortezomib is given intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a 'rest period' without treatment. the duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). you might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks). the following medicinal products are given on day 1 of each bortezomib 21-day treatment cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2. prednisone is given orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the bortezomib treatment cycle. how bortezomib hospira is given this medicine is for intravenous or subcutaneous use only. bortezomib will be administered by a health care professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines. bortezomib powder has to be dissolved before administration. this will be done by a healthcare professional. the resulting solution is then either injected into a vein or under the skin.

blood. therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with bortezomib, to check your blood cell counts regularly. you may experience a reduction in the number of: - platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury (e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding from the liver) - red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness - white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms. if you are given
