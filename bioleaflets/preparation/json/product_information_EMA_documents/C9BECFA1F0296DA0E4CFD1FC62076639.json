This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section  \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen  \nNucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \nEach 1 ml pre-filled pen contains 100 mg of mepolizumab. \n \nNucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \nEach 1 ml pre-filled syringe contains 100 mg of mepolizumab. \n \nMepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant \nDNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \nA clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow to pale brown solution \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents \nand children aged 6 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNucala should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and over \nThe recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. \n \nNucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered at least on \nan annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and level of control \nof exacerbations. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren aged 6 to 11 years old \nNucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen and Nucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled \nsyringe are not indicated for administration to this population. \n \nThe powder for solution for injection presentation is appropriate for administration to this population. The \nrecommended dose of mepolizumab is 40 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. \n \nChildren less than 6 years old \nThe safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in children less than 6 years old have not yet been established.  \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe Nucala pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe should be used for subcutaneous injection only. \n \nNucala may be self-administered by the patient or administered by a caregiver if their healthcare professional \ndetermines that it is appropriate, and the patient or caregiver are trained in injection techniques. \n \nFor self-administration the recommended injection sites are the abdomen or thigh. A caregiver can also inject \nNucala into the upper arm. \n \nComprehensive instructions for subcutaneous administration of Nucala in a pre-filled pen or pre-filled \nsyringe are provided in the instructions for use in the package leaflet. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAsthma exacerabations \n \nNucala should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. \n \nAsthma-related adverse symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be \ninstructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCorticosteroids \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of Nucala therapy is not recommended. Reduction \nin corticosteroid doses, if required, should be gradual and performed under the supervision of a physician. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHypersensitivity and administration-related reactions \n \nAcute and delayed systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, \nangioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration of Nucala. These \nreactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., \ntypically within several days). These reactions may occur for the first time after a long duration of treatment \n(see section 4.8). \n \nParasitic infections \n \nEosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with pre-\nexisting helminth infections should be treated before starting therapy. If patients become infected whilst \nreceiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, temporary discontinuation of \ntherapy should be considered. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance \nof mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), via interaction with their \ncognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 enzymes and drug \ntransporters, however, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers in severe refractory eosinophilic \nasthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression on hepatocytes. The potential \nfor interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of mepolizumab in \npregnant women.  \nMepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkeys. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). The potential for harm to a human fetus is unknown. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. Administration of \nNucala to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than \nany possible risk to the fetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data regarding the excretion of mepolizumab in human milk. However, mepolizumab was \nexcreted into the milk of cynomolgous monkeys at concentrations of less than 0.5% of those detected in \nplasma. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Nucala therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThere are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of anti-IL5 treatment on \nfertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNucala has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdults and adolescents \nIn clinical studies in subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, the most commonly reported \nadverse reactions during treatment were headache, injection site reactions and back pain. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 896 adults and 19 adolescent subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma received either a \nsubcutaneous or an intravenous dose of mepolizumab during three placebo-controlled clinical studies of 24 \nto 52 weeks duration. The table below presents the adverse reactions from the two placebo-controlled studies \nin patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously (n=263). \n \nThe safety profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) treated for a \nmedian of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies was similar to that observed \nin the placebo-controlled studies. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions Frequency \nInfections and infestations  Lower respiratory tract infection \n\nUrinary tract infection \nPharyngitis \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (systemic \nallergic)* \nAnaphylaxis** \n\nCommon \n \nRare \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache Very common \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nNasal congestion \n \n\nCommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain upper Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nEczema Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nAdministration-related reactions (systemic \nnon allergic)*** \nLocal injection site reactions \nPyrexia \n\nCommon \n \n\n* Systemic reactions including hypersensitivity have been reported at an overall incidence comparable to that \nof placebo. For examples of the associated manifestations reported and a description of the time to onset, see \nsection 4.4. \n\n**From spontaneous post marketing reporting. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n*** The most common manifestations associated with reports of systemic non-allergic administration-related \nreactions were rash, flushing and myalgia; these manifestations were reported infrequently and in <1% of \nsubjects receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reaction \n \nLocal injection site reactions \n \nIn 2 placebo-controlled studies the incidence of local injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100 mg \nsubcutaneous and placebo was 8% and 3%, respectively. These events were all non-serious, mild to \nmoderate in intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions occurred \nmainly at the start of treatment and within the first 3 injections with fewer reports on subsequent injections. \nThe most common manifestations reported with these events included pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and \nburning sensation. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThirty-seven adolescents (aged 12-17) were enrolled in four placebo-controlled studies (25 mepolizumab \ntreated intravenously or subcutaneously) of 24 to 52 weeks duration. Thirty -six paediatric patients (aged 6-\n11) received mepolizumab subcutaneously in an open-label study for 12 weeks. After a treatment \ninterruption of 8 weeks, 30 of these patients, received mepolizumab for a further 52 weeks. The safety \nprofile was similar to that seen in adults. No additional adverse reactions were identified. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of up to 1,500 mg were administered intravenously in a clinical trial to patients with \neosinophilic disease without evidence of dose-related toxicities. \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with mepolizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \ntreated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for obstructive \nairway diseases, ATC code: R03DX09. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 (IL-5) \nwith high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, \nrecruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the bioactivity of IL-5 with \nnanomolar potency by blocking the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\non the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and reducing the production and survival of \neosinophils. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma (adults/adolescents), following a dose of 100 mg \nadministered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric \nmean count at baseline of 290 to 40 cells/μL at week 32 (n=182), a reduction of 84% compared to placebo. \nThis magnitude of blood eosinophils reduction was maintained in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma \npatients (n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension \nstudies.  \nIn children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma administered mepolizumab \nsubcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at \nbaseline to week 52 of 306 (n=16) to 48 (n=15) following 40 mg (for a weight < 40kg) and 331 to \n44 cells/µL (n=10) following 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), a reduction from baseline of 85% and 87%, \nrespectively. \nIn adults, adolescents and children, this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide therapeutics, patients may \ndevelop antibodies to mepolizumab following treatment. In the placebo-controlled trials, 15/260 (6%) of \nadults and adolescents treated with 100 mg dose subcutaneously had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies \nafter having received at least one dose of mepolizumab.  \nThe immunogenicity profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) \ntreated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies was similar to \nthat observed in the placebo-controlled studies. \nIn children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma following either 40 mg \nsubcutaneously (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg subcutaneously (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), 2/35 (6%) had \ndetectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of mepolizumab during the \ninitial short phase of the study. No children had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies during the long-term \nphase of the study. Neutralising antibodies were detected in one adult subject. Anti-mepolizumab antibodies \ndid not discernibly impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab in the majority of \npatients and there was no evidence of a correlation between antibody titres and change in blood eosinophil \nlevel. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nThe efficacy of mepolizumab in the treatment of a targeted group of patients with severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical studies of between \n24-52 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 years and older. These patients either remained uncontrolled (at \nleast two severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months) on their current standard of care, including at least \nhigh doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus an additional maintenance treatment(s), or were dependent \non systemic corticosteroids. Additional maintenance treatments included long-acting beta2 -adrenergic \nagonists (LABA), leukotriene modifiers, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), theophylline, and oral \ncorticosteroids (OCS). \n \nThe two exacerbations studies MEA112997 and MEA115588 enrolled a total of 1192 patients, 60% females, \nwith a mean age of 49 years (range 12– 82). The proportion of patients on maintenance OCS was 31% and \n24%, respectively. Patients were required to have a history of two or more severe asthma exacerbations \nrequiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the past 12 months and reduced lung function at \nbaseline (pre-bronchodilator FEV1<80% in adults and <90% in adolescents). The mean number of \nexacerbations in the previous year was 3.6 and the mean predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 60%. \nPatients continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the studies. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFor the oral corticosteroid-sparing study MEA115575, a total of 135 patients were enrolled (55% were \nfemale; mean age of 50 years) who were being treated daily with OCS (5-35 mg per day), and high-dose ICS \nplus an additional maintenance medicine. \n \nDose-ranging efficacy MEA112997 (DREAM) study \n \nIn MEA112997, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of \n52 weeks duration in 616 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab significantly \nreduced clinically significant asthma exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of \noral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation and/or emergency department visits) when administered \nin doses of 75 mg, 250 mg or 750 mg intravenously compared to placebo (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Frequency of clinically significant exacerbations at week 52 in the intent to treat population \n\n Intravenous Mepolizumab  Placebo \n75mg \nn=153 \n\n250mg \nn=152 \n\n750mg \nn=156 \n\n \nn= 155 \n\nExacerbation rate/year 1.24 1.46 1.15 2.40 \nPercent reduction 48% 39% 52%  \n\nRate ratio (95% CI) 0.52 (0.39, 0.69) 0.61(0.46, 0.81) 0.48 (0.36, 0.64)  \n\np-value <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 - \n \n \nExacerbation reduction MEA115588 (MENSA) study  \n \nMEA115588 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study which \nevaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy in 576 patients with severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma defined as peripheral blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 150 cells/μL at initiation \nof treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/μL within the past 12 months. \n \nPatients received mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously, mepolizumab 75 mg administered \nintravenously or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over 32 weeks.

Patients had a blood eosinophil count of ≥150/µL at baseline or a \nblood eosinophil count of ≥300/µL in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were administered \nmepolizumab or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over the treatment period. Patients continued to \nreceive their existing asthma medicine during the study with the exception of their OCS dose which was \nreduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase (Weeks 4-20), as long as asthma control was \nmaintained. \n \nA total of 135 patients were enrolled: mean age was 50 years, 55% were female, and 48% had been receiving \noral steroid therapy for at least 5 years. The baseline mean prednisone equivalent dose was approximately \n13 mg per day. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the percent reduction in daily OCS dose (weeks 20-24), whilst maintaining \nasthma control by defined dose reduction categories (see Table 4). Predefined categories included percent \nreductions ranging from 90-100% reduction, to no decrease in the prednisone dose from the end of the \noptimisation phase.

Of these 34 subjects: 12 received placebo, 9 received mepolizumab 75 mg intravenously, and \n13 received 100 mg subcutaneously. In a combined analysis of these studies, a 40% reduction in clinically \nsignificant exacerbations was observed in adolescents following mepolizumab treatment compared to \nplacebo (rate ratio 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17, 2.10). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in patients with asthma, mepolizumab exhibited approximately dose-\nproportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12.5 mg to 250 mg. Following administration of a single \n100 mg subcutaneous dose in healthy subjects, mepolizumab systemic exposure was comparable between \nformulations. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to healthy subjects or patients with asthma, mepolizumab was \nabsorbed slowly with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) ranging from 4 to 8 \ndays. \nFollowing a single subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thigh or arm of healthy subjects, \nmepolizumab absolute bioavailability was 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively. In patients with asthma the \nabsolute bioavailability of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in the arm ranged from 74-80%. \nFollowing repeat subcutaneous administration every 4 weeks, there is approximately a two-fold \naccumulation at steady state. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, mepolizumab distributes into a mean \nvolume of distribution of 55 to 85 mL/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nMepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are widely \ndistributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, the mean systemic clearance (CL) \nranged from 1.9 to 3.3 mL/day/kg, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 20 days. Following \nsubcutaneous administration of mepolizumab the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 16 to 22 days. In \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated mepolizumab systemic clearance was 3.1 mL/day/kg. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data available in the paediatric population (59 subjects with eosinophilic \nesophagitis, 55 subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma). Intravenous mepolizumab \npharmacokinetics was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analysis in a paediatric study conducted in \nsubjects aged 2–17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis. Paediatric pharmacokinetics was largely \npredictable from adults, after taking into account bodyweight. Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in adolescent \nsubjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma included in the phase 3 studies were consistent with \nadults (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration in subjects 6 to 11 years old with severe \nrefractory eosinophilic asthma was investigated in an open label, uncontrolled study of 12-weeks duration. \nPaediatric pharmacokinetics were broadly consistent with adults and adolescents after accounting for \nbodyweight and bioavailability. The absolute subcutaneous bioavailability appears complete compared to \nthat observed in adults and adolescents of 76%. Exposure following subcutaneous administration of either 40 \nmg (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg) was 1.32 and 1.97 times of that observed in adults \nat 100 mg. \nInvestigation of a 40 mg subcutaneous dosing regimen administered every 4 weeks in children 6 to 11 years \nold over a 15-70 kg broad weight range by PK modelling and simulation predicts that the exposure of this \ndosing regimen would remain on average within 38% of adults at 100 mg. This dosing regimen is considered \nacceptable due to the wide therapeutic index of mepolizumab. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years old) \n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data available in elderly patients (≥65 years old) across all clinical studies \n(N=90). However, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no indications of an effect of age \non the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab over the age range of 12 to 82 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof mepolizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith creatinine clearance values between 50-80 mL/min. There are limited data available in patients with \ncreatinine clearance values <50 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic \nenzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the \nelimination of mepolizumab. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAs mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous administration to \nmonkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral and lung eosinophil counts, with no toxicological \nfindings. \n \nEosinophils are thought to be associated with immune system responses to some parasitic infections. Studies \nconducted in mice treated with anti-IL-5 antibodies or genetically deficient in IL-5 or eosinophils have not \nshown impaired ability to clear parasitic infections. The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown. \n \nFertility \n \nNo impairment of fertility was observed in a fertility and general reproduction toxicity study in mice \nperformed with an analogous antibody that inhibits IL-5 in mice. This study did not include a littering or \nfunctional offspring assessment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIn monkeys, mepolizumab had no effect on pregnancy or on embryonic/fetal and postnatal development \n(including immune function) of the offspring. Examinations for internal or skeletal malformations were not \nperformed. Data in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrate that mepolizumab crossed the placenta. \nConcentrations of mepolizumab were about 1.2-2.4 times higher in infants than in mothers for several \nmonths post partum and did not affect the immune system of the infants. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \nLyophilised white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents \nand children aged 6 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNucala should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and older \nThe recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. \n \nChildren aged 6 to 11 years old \nThe recommended dose of mepolizumab is 40 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. \n \nNucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered at least on \nan annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and level of control \nof exacerbations. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe posology of Nucala in children and adolescents aged between 6 to 17 years old with severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma has been determined by limited efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies \nand supported by modelling and simulation data (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNucala is for subcutaneous injection only and should be administered by a healthcare professional. It may be \ninjected into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. \n \nThe powder should be reconstituted prior to administration and the reconstituted solution should be used \nimmediately. For instructions on the reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \nEach vial of Nucala should be used for a single patient, and any remainder of the vial should be discarded. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nAsthma exacerabations \n \nNucala should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. \n \nAsthma-related adverse symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be \ninstructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nCorticosteroids \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of Nucala therapy is not recommended. Reduction \nin corticosteroid doses, if required, should be gradual and performed under the supervision of a physician. \n \nHypersensitivity and administration-related reactions \n \nAcute and delayed systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, \nangioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration of Nucala. These \nreactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., \ntypically within several days). These reactions may occur for the first time after a long duration of treatment \n(see section 4.8). \n \nParasitic infections \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nEosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with pre-\nexisting helminth infections should be treated before starting therapy. If patients become infected whilst \nreceiving treatment with Nucala and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, temporary discontinuation of \ntherapy should be considered. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nCytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance \nof mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), via interaction with their \ncognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 enzymes and drug \ntransporters, however, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers in severe refractory eosinophilic \nasthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression on hepatocytes. The potential \nfor interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of mepolizumab in \npregnant women.  \nMepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkeys. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). The potential for harm to a human fetus is unknown. \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. Administration of \nNucala to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than \nany possible risk to the fetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data regarding the excretion of mepolizumab in human milk. However, mepolizumab was \nexcreted into the milk of cynomolgous monkeys at concentrations of less than 0.5% of those detected in \nplasma. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Nucala therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of anti-IL5 treatment on \nfertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNucala has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nAdults and adolescents \n\nIn clinical studies in subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, the most commonly reported \nadverse reactions during treatment were headache, injection site reactions and back pain. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 896 adults and 19 adolescent subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma received either a \nsubcutaneous or an intravenous dose of mepolizumab during three placebo-controlled clinical studies of 24 \nto 52 weeks duration. The table below presents the adverse reactions from the two placebo-controlled studies \nin patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously (n=263). \n \nThe safety profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) treated for a \nmedian of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies was similar to that observed \nin the placebo-controlled studies. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions Frequency \nInfectionsand infestations  Lower respiratory tract infection \n\nUrinary tract infection \nPharyngitis \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (systemic \nallergic)* \nAnaphylaxis** \n\nCommon \n \nRare \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache Very common \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders  \n\nNasal congestion \n \n\nCommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain upper Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nEczema Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain Common \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nAdministration-related reactions (systemic \nnon allergic)*** \nLocal injection site reactions \nPyrexia \n\nCommon \n \n\n* Systemic reactions including hypersensitivity have been reported at an overall incidence comparable to that \nof placebo. For examples of the associated manifestations reported and a description of the time to onset, see \nsection 4.4. \n\n**From spontaneous post marketing reporting. \n \n*** The most common manifestations associated with reports of systemic non-allergic administration-related \nreactions were rash, flushing and myalgia; these manifestations were reported infrequently and in <1% of \nsubjects receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reaction \n \nLocal injection site reactions \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nIn 2 placebo-controlled studies the incidence of local injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100 mg \nsubcutaneous and placebo was 8% and 3%, respectively. These events were all non-serious, mild to \nmoderate in intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions occurred \nmainly at the start of treatment and within the first 3 injections with fewer reports on subsequent injections. \nThe most common manifestations reported with these events included pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and \nburning sensation. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThirty-seven adolescents (aged 12-17) were enrolled in four placebo-controlled studies (25 mepolizumab \ntreated intravenously or subcutaneously) of 24 to 52 weeks duration. Thirty -six paediatric patients (aged 6-\n11) received mepolizumab subcutaneously in an open-label study for 12 weeks. After a treatment \ninterruption of 8 weeks, 30 of these patients, received mepolizumab for a further 52 weeks. The safety \nprofile was similar to that seen in adults. No additional adverse reactions were identified. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of up to 1,500 mg were administered intravenously in a clinical trial to patients with \neosinophilic disease without evidence of dose-related toxicities. \n \nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose with mepolizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \ntreated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for obstructive \nairway diseases, ATC code: R03DX09. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 (IL-5) \nwith high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, \nrecruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the bioactivity of IL-5 with \nnanomolar potency by blocking the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed \non the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and reducing the production and survival of \neosinophils. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma (adults/adolescents), following a dose of 100 mg \nadministered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric \nmean count at baseline of 290 to 40 cells/µL at week 32 (n=182), a reduction of 84% compared to placebo.  \nThis magnitude of blood eosinophils reduction was maintained in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma \npatients (n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension \nstudies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\nIn children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma administered mepolizumab \nsubcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at \nbaseline to week 52 of 306 (n=16) to 48 (n=15) following 40 mg (for a weight < 40kg) and 331 to \n44 cells/µL (n=10) following 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), a reduction from baseline of 85% and 87%, \nrespectively. \nIn adults, adolescents and children, this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide therapeutics, patients may \ndevelop antibodies to mepolizumab following treatment. In the placebo-controlled trials, 15/260 (6%) of \nadults and adolescents treated with 100 mg dose subcutaneously had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies \nafter having received at least one dose of mepolizumab. \nThe immunogenicity profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) \ntreated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies was similar to \nthat observed in the placebo-controlled studies. \nIn children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma following either 40 mg \nsubcutaneously (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg subcutaneously (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), 2/35 (6%) had \ndetectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of mepolizumab during the \ninitial short phase of the study. No children had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies during the long-term \nphase of the study. Neutralising antibodies were detected in one adult subject. Anti-mepolizumab antibodies \ndid not discernibly impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab in the majority of \npatients and there was no evidence of a correlation between antibody titres and change in blood eosinophil \nlevel. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nThe efficacy of mepolizumab in the treatment of a targeted group of patients with severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical studies of between \n24-52 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 years and older. These patients either remained uncontrolled (at \nleast two severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months) on their current standard of care, including at least \nhigh doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus an additional maintenance treatment(s), or were dependent \non systemic corticosteroids. Additional maintenance treatments included long-acting beta2 -adrenergic \nagonists (LABA), leukotriene modifiers, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), theophylline, and oral \ncorticosteroids (OCS). \n \nThe two exacerbations studies MEA112997 and MEA115588 enrolled a total of 1192 patients, 60% females, \nwith a mean age of 49 years (range 12– 82). The proportion of patients on maintenance OCS was 31% and \n24%, respectively. Patients were required to have a history of two or more severe asthma exacerbations \nrequiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the past 12 months and reduced lung function at \nbaseline (pre-bronchodilator FEV1<80% in adults and <90% in adolescents). The mean number of \nexacerbations in the previous year was 3.6 and the mean predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 60%. \nPatients continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the studies. \n \nFor the oral corticosteroid-sparing study MEA115575, a total of 135 patients were enrolled (55% were \nfemale; mean age of 50 years) who were being treated daily with OCS (5-35 mg per day), and high-dose ICS \nplus an additional maintenance medicine. \n \nDose-ranging efficacy MEA112997 (DREAM) study \n \nIn MEA112997, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of \n52 weeks duration in 616 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab significantly \nreduced clinically significant asthma exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of \noral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation and/or emergency department visits) when administered \nin doses of 75 mg, 250 mg or 750 mg intravenously compared to placebo (see Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 1: Frequency of clinically significant exacerbations at week 52 in the intent to treat population \n Intravenous Mepolizumab  Placebo \n\n75mg \nn=153 \n\n250mg \nn=152 \n\n750mg \nn=156 \n\n \nn= 155 \n\nExacerbation rate/year 1.24 1.46 1.15 2.40 \nPercent reduction 48% 39% 52%  \n\nRate ratio (95% CI) 0.52 (0.39, 0.69) 0.61(0.46, 0.81) 0.48 (0.36, 0.64)  \n\np-value <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 - \n \n \nExacerbation reduction MEA115588 (MENSA) study  \n \nMEA115588 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study which \nevaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy in 576 patients with severe refractory \neosinophilic asthma defined as peripheral blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 150 cells/μL at initiation \nof treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/μL within the past 12 months. \n \nPatients received mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously, mepolizumab 75 mg administered \nintravenously or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over 32 weeks. The primary endpoint was the \nfrequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma and the reductions for both mepolizumab \ntreatment arms compared to placebo were statistically significant (p<0.001).

Of these 34 subjects: 12 received placebo, 9 received mepolizumab 75 mg intravenously, and \n13 received 100 mg subcutaneously. In a combined analysis of these studies, a 40% reduction in clinically \nsignificant exacerbations was observed in adolescents following mepolizumab treatment compared to \nplacebo (rate ratio 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17, 2.10). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in patients with asthma, mepolizumab exhibited approximately dose-\nproportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12.5 mg to 250 mg. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to healthy subjects or patients with asthma, mepolizumab was \nabsorbed slowly with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) ranging from 4 to 8 \ndays. \nFollowing a single subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thigh or arm of healthy subjects, \nmepolizumab absolute bioavailability was 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively. In patients with asthma the \nabsolute bioavailability of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in the arm ranged from 74-80%. \nFollowing repeat subcutaneous administration every 4 weeks, there is approximately a two-fold \naccumulation at steady state. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, mepolizumab distributes into a mean \nvolume of distribution of 55 to 85 mL/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are widely \ndistributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, the mean systemic clearance (CL) \nranged from 1.9 to 3.3 mL/day/kg, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 20 days. Following \nsubcutaneous administration of mepolizumab the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 16 to 22 days. In \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated mepolizumab systemic clearance was 3.1 mL/day/kg. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data available in the paediatric population (59 subjects with eosinophilic \nesophagitis, 55 subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma). Intravenous mepolizumab \npharmacokinetics was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analysis in a paediatric study conducted in \nsubjects aged 2–17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis. Paediatric pharmacokinetics was largely \npredictable from adults, after taking into account bodyweight. Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in adolescent \nsubjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma included in the phase 3 studies were consistent with \nadults (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration in subjects 6 to 11 years old with severe \nrefractory eosinophilic asthma was investigated in an open label, uncontrolled study of 12-weeks duration. \nPaediatric pharmacokinetics were broadly consistent with adults and adolescents after accounting for \n\n\n\n26 \n\nbodyweight and bioavailability. The absolute subcutaneous bioavailability appears complete compared to \nthat observed in adults and adolescents of 76%. Exposure following subcutaneous administration of either 40 \nmg (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg) was 1.32 and 1.97 times of that observed in adults \nat 100 mg. \nInvestigation of a 40 mg subcutaneous dosing regimen administered every 4 weeks in children 6 to 11 years \nold over a 15-70 kg broad weight range by PK modelling and simulation predicts that the exposure of this \ndosing regimen would remain on average within 38% of adults at 100 mg. This dosing regimen is considered \nacceptable due to the wide therapeutic index of mepolizumab. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (≥65 years old) \n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data available in elderly patients (≥65 years old) across all clinical studies \n(N=90). However, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no indications of an effect of age \non the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab over the age range of 12 to 82 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof mepolizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith creatinine clearance values between 50-80 mL/min. There are limited data available in patients with \ncreatinine clearance values <50 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic \nenzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the \nelimination of mepolizumab. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAs mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. \n \nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous administration to \nmonkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral and lung eosinophil counts, with no toxicological \nfindings. \n \nEosinophils are thought to be associated with immune system responses to some parasitic infections. Studies \nconducted in mice treated with anti-IL-5 antibodies or genetically deficient in IL-5 or eosinophils have not \nshown impaired ability to clear parasitic infections. The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown. \n \nFertility \n \nNo impairment of fertility was observed in a fertility and general reproduction toxicity study in mice \nperformed with an analogous antibody that inhibits IL-5 in mice. This study did not include a littering or \nfunctional offspring assessment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIn monkeys, mepolizumab had no effect on pregnancy or on embryonic/fetal and postnatal development \n(including immune function) of the offspring. Examinations for internal or skeletal malformations were not \nperformed. Data in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrate that mepolizumab crossed the placenta. \n\n\n\n27 \n\nConcentrations of mepolizumab were about 1.2-2.4 times higher in infants than in mothers for several \nmonths post partum and did not affect the immune system of the infants. \n \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions are the responsibility of user. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore below 25°C. \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nClear, colourless 10 mL type I glass vial, with bromobutyl rubber stopper and a grey aluminium overseal \nwith a plastic flip-cap containing 100 mg powder for solution for injection. \n \nPack sizes:  \n1 vial \nMultipack comprising 3 (3 packs of 1) vials \n \nNot all pack-sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nReconstitution should be carried out under aseptic conditions.  \n \nInstructions for reconstitution for each vial \n1. Reconstitute the contents of the vial with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injections preferably using a 2 \n\nto 3 mL syringe and a 21 gauge needle. The stream of sterile water should be directed vertically, onto the \n\n\n\n28 \n\ncentre of the lyophilised cake. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently \nswirling the vial for 10 seconds with circular motion at 15-second intervals until the powder is dissolved. \n \nNote: The reconstituted solution must not be shaken during the procedure as this may lead to product \nfoaming or precipitation. Reconstitution is typically complete within 5 minutes after the sterile water has \nbeen added, but it may take additional time.  \n \n\n2. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute Nucala, reconstitution can be \naccomplished by swirling at 450 rpm for no longer than 10 minutes. Alternatively, swirling at 1000 rpm \nfor no longer than 5 minutes is acceptable. \n\n3. Following reconstitution, Nucala should be visually inspected for particulate matter and clarity prior to \nuse.  The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, free of \nvisible particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable.

Step-by-step instructions for use \n \n1. What Nucala is and what it is used for \n \nNucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to \nrecognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 6 years and older. \n \nSome people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and \nlungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. \n \nNucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines such as \nhigh dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  \nIf you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need \nto control your asthma. \n \nMepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the action of \nthis protein, it limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of \neosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. \n \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n Step-by-step instructions for use \n \n1. What Nucala is and what it is used for \n \nNucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to \nrecognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 6 and over. \n \nSome people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and \nlungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. \n \nNucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines such as \nhigh dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  \nIf you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need \nto control your asthma. \n \nMepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the action of \nthis protein, it limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of \neosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Nucala \n \nDo not use Nucala: \n- if you are allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using this medicine. \n \nWorsening asthma \n\n\n\n82 \n\nSome people get asthma-related side effects, or their asthma may become worse, during treatment with \nNucala. \n\n Tell your doctor or nurse if your asthma remains uncontrolled, or gets worse, after you start \nNucala treatment. \n\n \nAllergic and injection site reactions \nMedicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into the \nbody (see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’).  \n If you may have had a similar reaction to any injection or medicine, \n\n Tell your doctor before you are given Nucala. \n \nParasitic infections \nNucala may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a parasitic \ninfection; it should be treated before you start treatment with Nucala. If you live in a region where these \ninfections are common or if you are travelling to such a region: \n\n Check with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you. \n \nChildren  \nThis medicine is not intended for use in children below 6 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Nucala \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nOther medicines for asthma \n\n Don’t suddenly stop taking your preventer medicines for your asthma once you have started \nNucala. These medicines (especially ones called corticosteriods) must be stopped gradually, under \nthe direct supervision of your doctor and dependant on your response to Nucala. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before using this medicine.  \n \nIt is not known whether the ingredients of Nucala can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, you \nmust check with your doctor before you use Nucala. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThe possible side effects of Nucala are unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nNucala contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, i.e., it is essentially “sodium-\nfree”. \n \n3. How to use Nucala \n \nNucala is given to you by a doctor, nurse or healthcare professional, as an injection just under the skin \n(subcutaneously). \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and over \n The recommended dose for adults and adolescents is 100 mg. You will be given 1 injection every \nfour weeks. \n \nChildren aged 6 to 11 years old  \n The recommended dose is 40 mg. You will be given 1 injection every four weeks. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nIf a dose of Nucala is missed \n Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n \nStopping treatment with Nucala \nDo not stop receiving injections of Nucala unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the \ntreatment with Nucala may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back. \n\n \nIf your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Nucala  \n Call your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n4.

The solution for \ninjection can be stored between 2°C to 30°C for no more than 8 hours. Any unused concentrate or solution \nremaining after 8 hours must be discarded. \n \nThe trade name (Nucala) and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the \npatient file. \n \nInstructions for reconstitution for each vial \n1. Reconstitute the contents of the vial with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injections preferably using a 2 \n\nto 3 ml syringe and a 21 gauge needle. The stream of sterile water should be directed vertically, onto the \ncentre of the lyophilised cake. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently \nswirling the vial for 10 seconds with circular motion at 15-second intervals until the powder is dissolved. \n \nNote: The reconstituted solution must not be shaken during the procedure as this may lead to product \nfoaming or precipitation. Reconstitution is typically complete within 5 minutes after the sterile water has \nbeen added, but it may take additional time.  \n \n\n2. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute Nucala, reconstitution can be \naccomplished by swirling at 450 rpm for no longer than 10 minutes. Alternatively, swirling at 1000 rpm \nfor no longer than 5 minutes is acceptable. \n\n3. Following reconstitution, Nucala should be visually inspected for particulate matter and clarity prior to \nuse.  The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, free of \nvisible particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. If particulate matter remains \nin the solution or if the solution appears cloudy or milky, the solution must not be used.  \n\n4. The reconstituted solution, if not used immediately must be: \n• Protected from sunlight  \n• Stored below 30°C, not frozen \n• Discarded if not used within 8 hours of reconstitution \n\n \nInstructions for administration of 100 mg dose \n1. For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 21 gauge \n\nto 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. \n2. Just prior to administration, remove 1 mL of reconstituted Nucala.  Do not shake the reconstituted \n\nsolution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or precipitation. \n3. Administer the 1 mL injection (equivalent to 100 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the upper arm, \n\nthigh, or abdomen. \n \n\nInstructions for administration of 40 mg dose \n1. For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 21 gauge \n\nto 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. \n2. Just prior to administration, remove 0.4mL of reconstituted Nucala.  Do not shake the reconstituted \n\nsolution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or precipitation. Dispose of the \nremaining solution. \n\n3. Administer the 0.4mL injection (equivalent to 40 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the upper arm, \nthigh, or abdomen.  \n \n\n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
