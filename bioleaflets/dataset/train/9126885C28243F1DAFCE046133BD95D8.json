NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSynagis 50 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach vial contains 50 mg palivizumab*, providing 100 mg/ml of palivizumab when reconstituted as \nrecommended. \n \n*Palivizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced by DNA technology in \nmouse myeloma host cells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nThe powder is a white to off-white cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSynagis is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring \nhospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  \n \n\u2022 Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the \n\nRSV season. \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia \n\nwithin the last 6 months. \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart \n\ndisease. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of palivizumab is 15 mg/kg of body weight, given once a month during \nanticipated periods of RSV risk in the community.  \n \nThe volume (expressed in ml) of // Palivizumab // to be administered at one-monthly intervals = \n[patient weight in kg] multiplied by 0.15. \n \nWhere possible, the first dose should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season.  \nSubsequent doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season.  The efficacy of \npalivizumab at doses other than 15 mg per kg or of dosing differently from monthly throughout the \nRSV season, has not been established. \n \nThe majority of experience including the pivotal phase III clinical trials with palivizumab has been \ngained with 5 injections during one season (see section 5.1).  Data, although limited, are available on \ngreater than 5 doses (see sections 4.8 and 5.1), therefore the benefit in terms of protection beyond 5 \ndoses has not been established. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTo reduce risk of rehospitalisation, it is recommended that children receiving palivizumab who are \nhospitalised with RSV continue to receive monthly doses of palivizumab for the duration of the RSV \nseason.   \n \nFor children undergoing cardiac bypass, it is recommended that a 15 mg/kg of body weight injection \nof palivizumab be administered as soon as stable after surgery to ensure adequate palivizumab serum \nlevels.  Subsequent doses should resume monthly through the remainder of the RSV season for \nchildren that continue to be at high risk of RSV disease (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nPalivizumab is administered intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  The \ngluteal muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site because of the risk of damage to the \nsciatic nerve.  The injection should be given using standard aseptic technique.  \n \nInjection volumes over 1 ml should be given as a divided dose. \n \nTo ensure the correct volume is reconstituted for Synagis, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to other \nhumanised monoclonal antibodies. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAllergic reactions including very rare cases of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported \nfollowing palivizumab administration.  In some cases, fatalities have been reported (see section 4.8).   \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and \nanaphylactic shock, should be available for immediate use following administration of palivizumab. \n \nA moderate to severe acute infection or febrile illness may warrant delaying the use of palivizumab, \nunless, in the opinion of the physician, withholding palivizumab entails a greater risk.  A mild febrile \nillness, such as mild upper respiratory infection, is not usually reason to defer administration of \npalivizumab. \n \nPalivizumab should be given with caution to patients with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder. \n \nThe efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of treatment during an \nensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with this objective.  The \npossible risk of enhanced RSV infection in the season following the season in which the patients were \ntreated with palivizumab has not been conclusively ruled out by studies performed aiming at this \nparticular point. \n \n4.5   Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted.  In the phase III IMpact-\nRSV study in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions \nof patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza \nvaccine, bronchodilators or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse \nreactions was observed among patients receiving these agents. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSince the monoclonal antibody is specific for RSV, palivizumab is not expected to interfere with the \nimmune response to vaccines. \n \nPalivizumab may interfere with immune-based RSV diagnostic tests, such as some antigen detection \nbased assays.  In addition, palivizumab inhibits virus replication in cell culture and, therefore, may \nalso interfere with viral culture assays.  Palivizumab does not interfere with reverse transcriptase \npolymerase chain reaction-based assays.  Assay interference could lead to false-negative RSV \ndiagnostic test results.  Therefore, diagnostic test results, when obtained, should be used in conjunction \nwith clinical findings to guide medical decisions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot relevant.  Synagis is not indicated for use in adults.  Data on fertility, pregnancy and lactation are \nnot available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most serious adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are anaphylaxis and other acute \nhypersensitivity reactions.  Common adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are fever, rash and \ninjection site reaction. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions  both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency \n(very common  \u2265 1/10; common  \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon  \u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100 ; rare \u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000) in studies conducted in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric patients, \nand paediatric congenital heart disease patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions identified via post-marketing surveillance are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size; it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to palivizumab exposure.  The frequency for these \"ADRs\" as presented in the \ntable below was estimated using the safety data of the two registration clinical studies.  The incidences \nof these reactions in these studies showed no difference between the palivizumab and placebo groups \nand the reactions were not drug related. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nUndesirable effects in clinical studies* and post-marketing reports in paediatric patients \nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nFrequency  ADR  \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia# \n\nImmune system disorders Not known Anaphylaxis, anaphylactic \nshock (in some cases, \nfatalities have been \nreported.)# \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon Convulsion# \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Apnoea# \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common  \n \nUncommon \n\nRash  \n \nUrticaria# \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministrative site \nconditions \n\nVery common  \n \nCommon \n\nPyrexia \n \nInjection site reaction \n\n *For full study description, see Section 5.1 Clinical studies \n # ADRs identified from post-marketing surveillance \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPost-marketing experience \nPost-marketing serious spontaneous adverse reactions reported during palivizumab treatment between \n1998 and 2002 covering four RSV seasons were evaluated.  A total of 1,291 serious reports were \nreceived where palivizumab had been administered as indicated and the duration of therapy was within \none season.  The onset of the adverse reactions occurred after the sixth or greater dose in only 22 of \nthese reports (15 after the sixth dose, 6 after the seventh doses and 1 after the eight dose).  These \nadverse reactions are similar in character to those after the initial five doses.  \n \nPalivizumab treatment schedule and adverse reactions were monitored in a group of nearly 20,000 \ninfants tracked through a patient compliance registry between 1998 and 2000.  Of this group 1,250 \nenrolled infants had 6 injections, 183 infants had 7 injections, and 27 infants had either 8 or 9 \ninjections.  Adverse reactions observed in patients after a sixth or greater dose were similar in \ncharacter and frequency to those after the initial 5 doses.   \n \nIn an observational, post-marketing, database study, a small increase in the frequency of asthma was \nobserved among preterm palivizumab recipients; however, the causal relationship is uncertain. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, three children received an overdose of more than 15 mg/kg.  These doses were \n20.25 mg/kg, 21.1 mg/kg and 22.27 mg/kg.  No medical consequences were identified in these \ninstances. \n \nFrom the post-marketing experience, overdoses with doses up to 85 mg/kg have been reported and in \nsome cases, adverse reactions were reported which did not differ from those observed with 15 mg/kg \ndose (see section 4.8).  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted \nimmediately.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  immune sera immunoglobulins, specific immunoglobulins; ATC Code: \nJ06BB16 \n \nPalivizumab is a humanised IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope in the A antigenic site \nof the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  This humanised monoclonal antibody is \ncomposed of human (95%) and murine (5%) antibody sequences.  It has potent neutralising and \nfusion-inhibitory activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains.   \n \nPalivizumab serum concentrations of approximately 30 \u00b5g/ml have been shown to produce a 99% \nreduction in pulmonary RSV replication in the cotton rat model. \n \nIn vitro studies of antiviral activity \nThe antiviral activity of palivizumab was assessed in a microneutralization assay in which increasing \nconcentrations of antibody were incubated with RSV prior to addition of the human epithelial cells \nHEp-2.  After incubation for 4-5 days, RSV antigen was measured in an enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The neutralization titre (50% effective concentration [EC50]) is \nexpressed as the antibody concentration required to reduce detection of RSV antigen by 50% \ncompared with untreated virus-infected cells.  Palivizumab exhibited median EC50 values of 0.65 \n\u00b5g/ml (mean [standard deviation] = 0.75 [0.53] \u00b5g/ml; n=69, range 0.07\u20132.89 \u00b5g/ml) and 0.28 \u00b5g/ml \n(mean [standard deviation] = 0.35 [0.23] \u00b5g/ml; n=35, range 0.03\u20130.88 \u00b5g/ml) against clinical RSV A \nand RSV B isolates, respectively.  The majority of clinical RSV isolates tested (n=96) were collected \nfrom subjects in the United States.  \n \nResistance \nPalivizumab binds a highly conserved region on the extracellular domain of mature RSV F protein, \nreferred to as antigenic site II or A antigenic site, which encompasses amino acids 262 to 275.  In a \ngenotypic analysis of 126 clinical isolates from 123 children who failed immunoprophylaxis, all RSV \nmutants that exhibited resistance to palivizumab (n=8) were shown to contain amino acid changes in \nthis region of the F protein.  No polymorphic or non-polymorphic sequence variations outside of the A \nantigenic site on the RSV F protein were shown to render RSV resistant to neutralisation by \npalivizumab.  At least one of the palivizumab resistance-associated substitutions, N262D, K272E/Q, \nor S275F/L was identified in these 8 clinical RSV isolates resulting in a combined resistance-\nassociated mutation frequency of 6.3% in these patients.  A review of clinical findings did not reveal \nan association between A antigenic site sequence changes and RSV disease severity among children \nreceiving palivizumab immunoprophylaxis who develop RSV lower respiratory tract disease.  \nAnalysis of 254 clinical RSV isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-na\u00efve subjects revealed \npalivizumab resistance-associated substitutions in 2 (1 with N262D and 1 with S275F), resulting in a \nresistance associated mutation frequency of 0.79%. \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAntibody to palivizumab was observed in approximately 1% of patients in the IMpact-RSV during the \nfirst course of therapy.  This was transient, low titre, resolved despite continued use (first and second \nseason), and could not be detected in 55 of 56 infants during the second season (including 2 with titres \nduring the first season).  Immunogenicity was not studied in the congenital heart disease study.  \nAntibody to palivizumab was evaluated in four additional studies in 4337 patients (children born at 35 \nweeks of gestation or less and 6 months of age or less, or  24 months of age or less with  \nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were \nincluded in these studies) and was observed in 0% \u2013 1.5% of patients at different study timepoints.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThere was no association observed between the presence of antibody and adverse events.  Therefore, \nanti-drug antibody (ADA) responses appear to be of no clinical relevance. \n \nStudies using lyophilised palivizumab  \nIn a placebo-controlled trial of RSV disease prophylaxis in (IMpact-RSV trial) 1502 high-risk children \n(1002 Synagis; 500 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg reduced the incidence of RSV related \nhospitalisation by 55% (p = < 0.001).  The RSV hospitalisation rate was 10.6% in the placebo group.  \nOn this basis, the absolute risk reduction is 5.8% which means the number needed to treat is 17 to \nprevent one hospitalisation.  The severity of RSV disease in children hospitalised despite prophylaxis \nwith palivizumab in terms of days in ICU stay per 100 children and days of mechanical ventilation per \n100 children was not affected. \n \nA total of 222 children were enrolled in two separate studies to examine the safety of palivizumab \nwhen it is administered for a second RSV season.  One hundred and three (103) children received \nmonthly palivizumab injections for the first time, and 119 children received palivizumab for two \nconsecutive seasons.  No difference between groups regarding immunogenicity was observed in either \nstudy.  However, as the efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of \ntreatment during an ensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with \nthis objective, the relevance of these data in terms of efficacy is unknown. \n \nIn an open label prospective trial designed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity \nafter administration of 7 doses of palivizumab within a single RSV season, pharmacokinetic data \nindicated that adequate mean palivizumab levels were achieved in all 18 children enrolled.  Transient, \nlow levels of antipalivizumab antibody were observed in one child after the second dose of \npalivizumab that dropped to undetectable levels at the fifth and seventh dose. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled trial in 1,287 patients \u2264 24 months of age with haemodynamically significant \ncongenital heart disease (639 Synagis; 648 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg Synagis reduced \nthe incidence of RSV hospitalisations by 45% (p = 0.003) (congenital heart disease study).  Groups \nwere equally balanced between cyanotic and acyanotic patients.  The RSV hospitalisation rate was \n9.7% in the placebo group and 5.3% in the Synagis group.  Secondary efficacy endpoints showed \nsignificant reductions in the Synagis group compared to placebo in total days of RSV hospitalisation \n(56% reduction, p = 0.003) and total RSV days with increased supplemental oxygen (73% reduction, \np = 0.014) per 100 children.   \n \nA retrospective observational study was conducted in young children with hemodynamically \nsignificant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) comparing the occurrence of primary serious adverse \nevents (PSAEs: infection, arrhythmia, and death) between those who did (1009) and did not receive \nSynagis prophylaxis (1009) matched by age, type of cardiac lesion, and prior corrective surgery. The \nincidence of arrhythmia and death PSAEs was similar in children who did and did not receive \nprophylaxis. The incidence of infection PSAEs was lower in children who received prophylaxis as \ncompared to those children who did not receive prophylaxis. The results of the study indicate no \nincreased risk of serious infection, serious arrhythmia, or death in children with HSCHD associated \nwith Synagis prophylaxis compared with children who did not receive prophylaxis \n \nStudies using liquid palivizumab \nTwo clinical studies were conducted to directly compare liquid and lyophilised formulations of \npalivizumab.  In the first study, all 153 premature infants received both formulations in different \nsequences.   In the second study, 211 and 202 premature infants or children with chronic lung disease \nreceived liquid and lyophilised palivizumab, respectively.  In two additional studies, liquid \npalivizumab was used as an active control (3918 pediatric subjects) to evaluate an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody for prophylaxis of serious RSV disease in premature infants or children with \nBPD or hemodynamically significant CHD (see below for further details of these two studies).  The \noverall rate and pattern of adverse events, study drug discontinuation due to AEs, and the number of \ndeaths reported in these clinical studies were consistent with those observed during the clinical \ndevelopment programs for the lyophilised formulation.  No deaths were considered related to \npalivizumab and no new ADRs were identified in these studies.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nPre-term infants and children with Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity (CLDP): this trial, conducted \nat 347 centers in the North America, European Union and 10 other countries, studied patients less than \nor equal to 24 months of age with CLDP and patients with premature birth (less than or equal to 35 \nweeks gestation) who were less than or equal to 6 months of age at study entry.  Patients with \nhemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were excluded from enrollment in this study and \nwere studied in a separate study.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=3306) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=3329).  Subjects were followed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-\neight percent of all subjects receiving palivizumab completed the study and 97% received all five \ninjections.  The primary endpoint was the incidence of RSV hospitalisation.  RSV hospitalisations \noccurred among 62 of 3306 (1.9%) patients in the palivizumab group.  The RSV hospitalisation rate \nobserved in patients enrolled with a diagnosis of CLDP was 28/723 (3.9%) and in patients enrolled \nwith a diagnosis of prematurity without CLDP was 34/2583 (1.3%).  \n \nCHD Study 2: this trial, conducted at 162 centers in North America, European Union and 4 other \ncountries over two RSV seasons, studied patients less than or equal to 24 months of age with \nhemodynamically significant CHD.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=612) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=624).  Subjects were stratified by cardiac lesion (cyanotic vs. other) and were \nfollowed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-seven percent of all subjects receiving \npalivizumab completed the study and 95% received all five injections.  The primary endpoint was a \nsummary of adverse events and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence \nof RSV hospitalisation.  The incidence of RSV hospitalisation was 16 of 612 (2.6%) in the \npalivizumab group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nLyophilised formulation of palivizumab \nIn studies in adult volunteers, palivizumab had a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a human IgG1 \nantibody with regard to volume of distribution (mean 57 ml/kg) and half-life (mean 18 days).  In \nprophylactic studies in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the mean \nhalf-life of palivizumab was 20 days and monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg achieved mean \n30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after the first \ninjection, approximately 60 \u00b5g/ml after the second injection, approximately 70 \u00b5g/ml after the third \ninjection and fourth injection.  In the congenital heart disease study, monthly intramuscular doses of \n15 mg/kg achieved mean 30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately \n55 \u00b5g/ml after the first injection and approximately 90 \u00b5g/ml after the fourth injection. \n \nAmong 139 children in the congenital heart disease study receiving palivizumab who had \ncardio-pulmonary bypass and for whom paired serum samples were available, the mean serum \npalivizumab concentration was approximately 100 \u00b5g/ml pre-cardiac bypass and declined to \napproximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after bypass. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose toxicology studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (maximum dose \n30 mg/kg), rabbits (maximum dose 50 mg/kg) and rats (maximum dose 840 mg/kg).  No significant \nfindings were observed. \n \nStudies carried out in rodents gave no indication of enhancement of RSV replication, or RSV-induced \npathology or generation of virus escape mutants in the presence of palivizumab under the chosen \nexperimental conditions. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSynagis is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring \nhospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  \n \n\u2022 Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the \n\nRSV season \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia \n\nwithin the last 6 months. \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart \n\ndisease. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of palivizumab is 15 mg/kg of body weight, given once a month during \nanticipated periods of RSV risk in the community.   \n \nThe volume (expressed in mL) of // Palivizumab // to be administered at one-monthly intervals = \n[patient weight in kg] multiplied by 0.15 \n \nWhere possible, the first dose should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season.  \nSubsequent doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season.  The efficacy of \npalivizumab at doses other than 15 mg per kg or of dosing differently from monthly throughout the \nRSV season, has not been established. \n \nThe majority of experience including the pivotal phase III clinical trials with palivizumab has been \ngained with 5 injections during one season (see section 5.1).  Data, although limited, are available on \ngreater than 5 doses (see sections 4.8 and 5.1), therefore the benefit in terms of protection beyond 5 \ndoses has not been established. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTo reduce risk of rehospitalisation, it is recommended that children receiving palivizumab who are \nhospitalised with RSV continue to receive monthly doses of palivizumab for the duration of the RSV \nseason. \n \nFor children undergoing cardiac bypass, it is recommended that a 15 mg/kg of body weight injection \nof palivizumab be administered as soon as stable after surgery to ensure adequate palivizumab serum \nlevels.  Subsequent doses should resume monthly through the remainder of the RSV season for \nchildren that continue to be at high risk of RSV disease (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nPalivizumab is administered intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  The \ngluteal muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site because of the risk of damage to the \nsciatic nerve.  The injection should be given using standard aseptic technique.  \n \nInjection volumes over 1 ml should be given as a divided dose. \n \nTo ensure the correct volume is reconstituted for Synagis, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or other \nhumanised monoclonal antibodies. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAllergic reactions including very rare cases of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported \nfollowing palivizumab administration.  In some cases, fatalities have been reported (see section 4.8).   \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and \nanaphylactic shock, should be available for immediate use following administration of palivizumab. \n \nA moderate to severe acute infection or febrile illness may warrant delaying the use of palivizumab, \nunless, in the opinion of the physician, withholding palivizumab entails a greater risk.  A mild febrile \nillness, such as mild upper respiratory infection, is not usually reason to defer administration of \npalivizumab. \n \nPalivizumab should be given with caution to patients with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder. \n \nThe efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of treatment during an \nensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with this objective.  The \npossible risk of enhanced RSV infection in the season following the season in which the patients were \ntreated with palivizumab has not been conclusively ruled out by studies performed aiming at this \nparticular point. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted.  In the phase III IMpact-\nRSV study in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions \nof patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza \nvaccine, bronchodilators or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse \nreactions was observed among patients receiving these agents. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSince the monoclonal antibody is specific for RSV, palivizumab is not expected to interfere with the \nimmune response to vaccines. \n \nPalivizumab may interfere with immune-based RSV diagnostic tests, such as some antigen detection \nbased assays.  In addition, palivizumab inhibits virus replication in cell culture and, therefore, may \nalso interfere with viral culture assays.  Palivizumab does not interfere with reverse transcriptase \npolymerase chain reaction-based assays.  Assay interference could lead to false-negative RSV \ndiagnostic test results.  Therefore, diagnostic test results, when obtained, should be used in conjunction \nwith clinical findings to guide medical decisions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot relevant.  Synagis is not indicated for use in adults.  Data on fertility, pregnancy and lactation are \nnot available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most serious adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are anaphylaxis and other acute \nhypersensitivity reactions.  Common adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are fever, rash, and \ninjection site reaction. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency \n(very common  \u2265 1/10; common \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon  \u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare \u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000) in studies conducted in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric patients, \nand paediatric congenital heart disease patients.  \n \nThe adverse reactions identified via post-marketing surveillance are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size; it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to palivizumab exposure.  The frequency for these \"ADRs\" as presented in the \ntable below was estimated using the safety data of the two registration clinical studies.  The incidences \nof these reactions in these studies showed no difference between the palivizumab and placebo groups \nand the reactions were not drug related. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nUndesirable effects in clinical studies* and post-marketing reports in paediatric patients \nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nFrequency  ADR  \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia# \n\nImmune system disorders Not known Anaphylaxis, anaphylactic \nshock (in some cases, \nfatalities have been \nreported.)# \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon Convulsion# \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Apnoea# \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common  \n \nUncommon \n\nRash  \n \nUrticaria# \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministrative site \nconditions \n\nVery common  \n \nCommon \n\nPyrexia \n \nInjection site reaction \n\n *For full study description, see Section 5.1 Clinical studies \n # ADRs identified from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPost-marketing experience \nPost-marketing serious spontaneous adverse reactions reported during palivizumab treatment between \n1998 and 2002 covering four RSV seasons were evaluated.  A total of 1,291 serious reports were \nreceived where palivizumab had been administered as indicated and the duration of therapy was within \none season.  The onset of the adverse reactions occurred after the sixth or greater dose in only 22 of \nthese reports (15 after the sixth dose, 6 after the seventh doses and 1 after the eight dose).  These \nadverse reactions are similar in character to those after the initial five doses.  \n \nPalivizumab treatment schedule and adverse reactions were monitored in a group of nearly 20,000 \ninfants tracked through a patient compliance registry between 1998 and 2000.  Of this group 1,250 \nenrolled infants had 6 injections, 183 infants had 7 injections, and 27 infants had either 8 or 9 \ninjections.  Adverse reactions observed in patients after a sixth or greater dose were similar in \ncharacter and frequency to those after the initial 5 doses.   \n \nIn an observational, post-marketing, database study, a small increase in the frequency of asthma was \nobserved among preterm palivizumab recipients; however, the causal relationship is uncertain. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, three children received an overdose of more than 15 mg/kg.  These doses were \n20.25 mg/kg, 21.1 mg/kg and 22.27 mg/kg.  No medical consequences were identified in these \ninstances. \n \nFrom the post-marketing experience, overdoses with doses up to 85 mg/kg have been reported and in \nsome cases, adverse reactions were reported which did not differ from those observed with 15 mg/kg \ndose (see section 4.8).  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted \nimmediately.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera immunoglobulins, specific immunoglobulins; ATC Code: \nJ06BB16 \n \nPalivizumab is a humanised IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope in the A antigenic site \nof the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  This humanised monoclonal antibody is \ncomposed of human (95%) and murine (5%) antibody sequences.  It has potent neutralising and \nfusion-inhibitory activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains.   \n \nPalivizumab serum concentrations of approximately 30 \u00b5g/ml have been shown to produce a 99% \nreduction in pulmonary RSV replication in the cotton rat model. \n \nIn vitro studies of antiviral activity \nThe antiviral activity of palivizumab was assessed in a microneutralization assay in which increasing \nconcentrations of antibody were incubated with RSV prior to addition of the human epithelial cells \nHEp-2.  After incubation for 4-5 days, RSV antigen was measured in an enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The neutralization titre (50% effective concentration [EC50]) is \nexpressed as the antibody concentration required to reduce detection of RSV antigen by 50% \ncompared with untreated virus-infected cells.  Palivizumab exhibited median EC50 values of 0.65 \n\u00b5g/ml (mean [standard deviation] = 0.75 [0.53] \u00b5g/ml; n=69, range 0.07\u20132.89 \u00b5g/ml) and 0.28 \u00b5g/ml \n(mean [standard deviation] = 0.35 [0.23] \u00b5g/ml; n=35, range 0.03\u20130.88 \u00b5g/ml) against clinical RSV A \nand RSV B isolates, respectively.  The majority of clinical RSV isolates tested (n=96) were collected \nfrom subjects in the United States. \n \nResistance \nPalivizumab binds a highly conserved region on the extracellular domain of mature RSV F protein, \nreferred to as antigenic site II or A antigenic site, which encompasses amino acids 262 to 275  In a \ngenotypic analysis of 126 clinical isolates from 123 children who failed immunoprophylaxis, all RSV \nmutants that exhibited resistance to palivizumab (n=8) were shown to contain amino acid changes in \nthis region of the F protein. No polymorphic or non-polymorphic sequence variations outside of the A \nantigenic site on the RSV F protein were shown to render RSV resistant to neutralisation by \npalivizumab. At least one of the palivizumab resistance-associated substitutions, N262D, K272E/Q, or \nS275F/L was identified in these 8 clinical RSV isolates resulting in a combined resistance-associated \nmutation frequency of 6.3% in these patients.  A review of clinical findings did not reveal an \nassociation between A antigenic site sequence changes and RSV disease severity among children \nreceiving palivizumab immunoprophylaxis who develop RSV lower respiratory tract disease.  \nAnalysis of 254 clinical RSV isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-na\u00efve subjects revealed \npalivizumab resistance-associated substitutions in 2 (1 with N262D and 1 with S275F), resulting in a \nresistance associated mutation frequency of 0.79%. \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAntibody to palivizumab was observed in approximately 1% of patients in the IMpact-RSV during the \nfirst course of therapy.  This was transient, low titre, resolved despite continued use (first and second \nseason), and could not be detected in 55 of 56 infants during the second season (including 2 with titres \nduring the first season).  Immunogenicity was not studied in the congenital heart disease study. \nAntibody to palivizumab was evaluated in four additional studies in 4337 patients (children born at 35 \nweeks of gestation or less and 6 months of age or less, or  24 months of age or less with \nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were \nincluded in these studies) and was observed in 0% \u2013 1.5% of patients at different study timepoints.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThere was no association observed between the presence of antibody and adverse events.  Therefore, \nanti-drug antibody (ADA) responses appear to be of no clinical relevance. \n \nStudies using lyophilised palivizumab \nIn a placebo-controlled trial of RSV disease prophylaxis in (IMpact-RSV trial) 1502 high-risk children \n(1002 Synagis; 500 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg reduced the incidence of RSV related \nhospitalisation by 55% (p = < 0.001).  The RSV hospitalisation rate was 10.6% in the placebo group.  \nOn this basis, the absolute risk reduction is 5.8% which means the number needed to treat is 17 to \nprevent one hospitalisation.  The severity of RSV disease in children hospitalised despite prophylaxis \nwith palivizumab in terms of days in ICU stay per 100 children and days of mechanical ventilation per \n100 children was not affected. \n \nA total of 222 children were enrolled in two separate studies to examine the safety of palivizumab \nwhen it is administered for a second RSV season.  One hundred and three (103) children received \nmonthly palivizumab injections for the first time, and 119 children received palivizumab for two \nconsecutive seasons.  No difference between groups regarding immunogenicity was observed in either \nstudy.  However, as the efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of \ntreatment during an ensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with \nthis objective, the relevance of these data in terms of efficacy is unknown. \n \nIn an open label prospective trial designed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity \nafter administration of 7 doses of palivizumab within a single RSV season, pharmacokinetic data \nindicated that adequate mean palivizumab levels were achieved in all 18 children enrolled.  Transient, \nlow levels of antipalivizumab antibody were observed in one child after the second dose of \npalivizumab that dropped to undetectable levels at the fifth and seventh dose. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled trial in 1,287 patients \u2264 24 months of age with haemodynamically significant \ncongenital heart disease (639 Synagis; 648 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg Synagis reduced \nthe incidence of RSV hospitalisations by 45% (p = 0.003) (congenital heart disease study).  Groups \nwere equally balanced between cyanotic and acyanotic patients.  The RSV hospitalisation rate was \n9.7% in the placebo group and 5.3% in the Synagis group.  Secondary efficacy endpoints showed \nsignificant reductions in the Synagis group compared to placebo in total days of RSV hospitalisation \n(56% reduction, p = 0.003) and total RSV days with increased supplemental oxygen (73% reduction, \np = 0.014) per 100 children.   \n \nA retrospective observational study was conducted in young children with hemodynamically \nsignificant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) comparing the occurrence of primary serious adverse \nevents (PSAEs: infection, arrhythmia, and death) between those who did (1009) and did not receive \nSynagis prophylaxis (1009) matched by age, type of cardiac lesion, and prior corrective surgery.  The \nincidence of arrhythmia and death PSAEs was similar in children who did and did not receive \nprophylaxis.  The incidence of infection PSAEs was lower in children who received prophylaxis as \ncompared to those children who did not receive prophylaxis.  The results of the study indicate no \nincreased risk of serious infection, serious arrhythmia, or death in children with HSCHD associated \nwith Synagis prophylaxis compared with children who did not receive prophylaxis. \n \nStudies using liquid palivizumab \nTwo clinical studies were conducted to directly compare liquid and lyophilised formulations of \npalivizumab.  In the first study, all 153 premature infants received both formulations in different \nsequences.  In the second study, 211 and 202 premature infants or children with chronic lung disease \nreceived liquid and lyophilised palivizumab, respectively.  In two additional studies, liquid \npalivizumab was used as an active control (3918 pediatric subjects) to evaluate an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody for prophylaxis of serious RSV disease in premature infants or children with \nBPD or hemodynamically significant CHD (see below for further details of these two studies).  The \noverall rate and pattern of adverse events, study drug discontinuation due to AEs, and the number of \ndeaths reported in these clinical studies were consistent with those observed during the clinical \ndevelopment programs for the lyophilised formulation.  No deaths were considered related to \npalivizumab and no new ADRs were identified in these studies.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nPre-term infants and children with Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity (CLDP): this trial, conducted \nat 347 centers in the North America, European Union and 10 other countries, studied patients less than \nor equal to 24 months of age with CLDP and patients with premature birth (less than or equal to 35 \nweeks gestation) who were less than or equal to 6 months of age at study entry.  Patients with \nhemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were excluded from enrollment in this study and \nwere studied in a separate study.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=3306) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=3329).  Subjects were followed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-\neight percent of all subjects receiving palivizumab completed the study and 97% received all five \ninjections.  The primary endpoint was the incidence of RSV hospitalisation.  RSV hospitalisations \noccurred among 62 of 3306 (1.9%) patients in the palivizumab group.  The RSV hospitalisation rate \nobserved in patients enrolled with a diagnosis of CLDP was 28/723 (3.9%) and in patients enrolled \nwith a diagnosis of prematurity without CLDP was 34/2583 (1.3%).  \n \nCHD Study 2: this trial, conducted at 162 centers in North America, European Union and 4 other \ncountries over two RSV seasons, studied patients less than or equal to 24 months of age with \nhemodynamically significant CHD.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=612) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=624).  Subjects were stratified by cardiac lesion (cyanotic vs. other) and were \nfollowed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-seven percent of all subjects receiving \npalivizumab completed the study and 95% received all five injections.  The primary endpoint was a \nsummary of adverse events and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence \nof RSV hospitalisation.  The incidence of RSV hospitalisation was 16 of 612 (2.6%) in the \npalivizumab group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nLyophilised formulation of palivizumab \nIn studies in adult volunteers, palivizumab had a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a human IgG1 \nantibody with regard to volume of distribution (mean 57 ml/kg) and half-life (mean 18 days).  In \nprophylactic studies in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the mean \nhalf-life of palivizumab was 20 days and monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg achieved mean \n30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after the first \ninjection, approximately 60 \u00b5g/ml after the second injection, approximately 70 \u00b5g/ml after the third \ninjection and fourth injection.  In the congenital heart disease study, monthly intramuscular doses of \n15 mg/kg achieved mean 30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately \n55 \u00b5g/ml after the first injection and approximately 90 \u00b5g/ml after the fourth injection. \n \nAmong 139 children in the congenital heart disease study receiving palivizumab who had \ncardio-pulmonary bypass and for whom paired serum samples were available, the mean serum \npalivizumab concentration was approximately 100 \u00b5g/ml pre-cardiac bypass and declined to \napproximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after bypass. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose toxicology studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (maximum dose \n30 mg/kg), rabbits (maximum dose 50 mg/kg) and rats (maximum dose 840 mg/kg).  No significant \nfindings were observed. \n \nStudies carried out in rodents gave no indication of enhancement of RSV replication, or RSV-induced \npathology or generation of virus escape mutants in the presence of palivizumab under the chosen \nexperimental conditions. \n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nThe solution is clear or slightly opalescent. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSynagis is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring \nhospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  \n \n\u2022 Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the \n\nRSV season. \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia \n\nwithin the last 6 months. \n\u2022 Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart \n\ndisease. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of palivizumab is 15 mg/kg of body weight, given once a month during \nanticipated periods of RSV risk in the community.   \n \nThe volume (expressed in ml) of // Palivizumab // to be administered at one-monthly intervals = \n[patient weight in kg] multiplied by 0.15. \n \nWhere possible, the first dose should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season.  \nSubsequent doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season.  The efficacy of \npalivizumab at doses other than 15 mg per kg or of dosing differently from monthly throughout the \nRSV season, has not been established.  \n \nThe majority of experience including the pivotal phase III clinical trials with palivizumab has been \ngained with 5 injections during one season (see section 5.1).  Data, although limited, are available on \n\n\n\n21 \n\ngreater than 5 doses (see sections 4.8 and5.1), therefore the benefit in terms of protection beyond 5 \ndoses has not been established. \n \nTo reduce risk of rehospitalisation, it is recommended that children receiving palivizumab who are \nhospitalised with RSV continue to receive monthly doses of palivizumab for the duration of the RSV \nseason. \n \nFor children undergoing cardiac bypass, it is recommended that a 15 mg/kg of body weight injection \nof palivizumab be administered as soon as stable after surgery to ensure adequate palivizumab serum \nlevels.  Subsequent doses should resume monthly through the remainder of the RSV season for \nchildren that continue to be at high risk of RSV disease (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nPalivizumab is administered intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  The \ngluteal muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site because of the risk of damage to the \nsciatic nerve.  The injection should be given using standard aseptic technique.  \n \nInjection volumes over 1 ml should be given as a divided dose. \n \nSynagis solution for injection is a ready to use formulation.  For instructions on special handling \nrequirements, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to other \nhumanised monoclonal antibodies. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAllergic reactions including very rare cases of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported \nfollowing palivizumab administration.  In some cases, fatalities have been reported (see section 4.8).   \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and \nanaphylactic shock, should be available for immediate use following administration of palivizumab. \n \nA moderate to severe acute infection or febrile illness may warrant delaying the use of palivizumab, \nunless, in the opinion of the physician, withholding palivizumab entails a greater risk.  A mild febrile \nillness, such as mild upper respiratory infection, is not usually reason to defer administration of \npalivizumab. \n \nPalivizumab should be given with caution to patients with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder. \n \nThe efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of treatment during an \nensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with this objective.  The \npossible risk of enhanced RSV infection in the season following the season in which the patients were \ntreated with palivizumab has not been conclusively ruled out by studies performed aiming at this \nparticular point. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted.  In the phase III IMpact-\nRSV study in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions \n\n\n\n22 \n\nof patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza \nvaccine, bronchodilators or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse \nreactions was observed among patients receiving these agents. \n \nSince the monoclonal antibody is specific for RSV, palivizumab is not expected to interfere with the \nimmune response to vaccines. \n \nPalivizumab may interfere with immune-based RSV diagnostic tests, such as some antigen detection \nbased assays.  In addition, palivizumab inhibits virus replication in cell culture and, therefore, may \nalso interfere with viral culture assays.  Palivizumab does not interfere with reverse transcriptase \npolymerase chain reaction-based assays.  Assay interference could lead to false-negative RSV \ndiagnostic test results.  Therefore, diagnostic test results, when obtained, should be used in conjunction \nwith clinical findings to guide medical decisions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot relevant.  Synagis is not indicated for use in adults.  Data on fertility, pregnancy and lactation are \nnot available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nThe most serious adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are anaphylaxis and other acute \nhypersensitivity reactions.  Common adverse reactions occurring with palivizumab are fever, rash, and \ninjection site reaction. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions  both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency \n(very common  \u2265 1/10; common  \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon  \u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare \u2265 1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000 ) in studies conducted in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric patients, \nand paediatric congenital heart disease patients.  \n \nThe adverse reactions identified via post-marketing surveillance are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size; it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to palivizumab exposure.  The frequency for these \"ADRs\" as presented in the \ntable below was estimated using the safety data of the two registration clinical studies.  The incidences \nof these reactions in these studies showed no difference between the palivizumab and placebo groups \nand the reactions were not drug related. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nUndesirable effects in clinical studies* and post-marketing reports in paediatric patients \nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nFrequency  ADR  \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia# \n\nImmune system disorders Not known Anaphylaxis, anaphylactic \nshock (in some cases, \nfatalities have been \nreported.)# \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon Convulsion# \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Apnoea# \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common \n \nUncommon \n\nRash \n \nUrticaria# \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministrative site \nconditions \n\nVery common  \n \nCommon \n\nPyrexia \n \nInjection site reaction \n\n *For full study description, see Section 5.1 Clinical studies \n # ADRs identified from post-marketing surveillance \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPost-marketing experience \nPost-marketing serious spontaneous adverse reactions reported during palivizumab treatment between \n1998 and 2002 covering four RSV seasons were evaluated.  A total of 1,291 serious reports were \nreceived where palivizumab had been administered as indicated and the duration of therapy was within \none season.  The onset of the adverse reactions occurred after the sixth or greater dose in only 22 of \nthese reports (15 after the sixth dose, 6 after the seventh doses and 1 after the eight dose).  These \nadverse reactions are similar in character to those after the initial five doses.  \n \nPalivizumab treatment schedule and adverse reactions were monitored in a group of nearly 20,000 \ninfants tracked through a patient compliance registry between 1998 and 2000.  Of this group 1,250 \nenrolled infants had 6 injections, 183 infants had 7 injections, and 27 infants had either 8 or 9 \ninjections.  Adverse reactions observed in patients after a sixth or greater dose were similar in \ncharacter and frequency to those after the initial 5 doses.   \n \nIn an observational, post-marketing, database study, a small increase in the frequency of asthma was \nobserved among preterm palivizumab recipients; however, the causal relationship is uncertain. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, three children received an overdose of more than 15 mg/kg.  These doses were \n20.25 mg/kg, 21.1 mg/kg and 22.27 mg/kg.  No medical consequences were identified in these \ninstances. \n \nFrom the post-marketing experience, overdoses with doses up to 85 mg/kg have been reported and in \nsome cases, adverse reactions were reported which did not differ from those observed with 15 mg/kg \ndose (see section 4.8).  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted \nimmediately.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n24 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  immune sera immunoglobulins, specific immunoglobulins; ATC Code: \nJ06BB16. \n \nPalivizumab is a humanised IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope in the A antigenic site \nof the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  This humanised monoclonal antibody is \ncomposed of human (95%) and murine (5%) antibody sequences.  It has potent neutralising and \nfusion-inhibitory activity against both RSV subtype A and B strains. \n \nPalivizumab serum concentrations of approximately 30 \u00b5g/ml have been shown to produce a 99% \nreduction in pulmonary RSV replication in the cotton rat model. \n \nIn vitro studies of antiviral activity \nThe antiviral activity of palivizumab was assessed in a microneutralization assay in which increasing \nconcentrations of antibody were incubated with RSV prior to addition of the human epithelial cells \nHEp-2.  After incubation for 4-5 days, RSV antigen was measured in an enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The neutralization titre (50% effective concentration [EC50]) is \nexpressed as the antibody concentration required to reduce detection of RSV antigen by 50% \ncompared with untreated virus-infected cells.  Palivizumab exhibited median EC50 values of 0.65 \n\u00b5g/ml (mean [standard deviation] = 0.75 [0.53] \u00b5g/ml; n=69, range 0.07\u20132.89 \u00b5g/ml) and 0.28 \u00b5g/ml \n(mean [standard deviation] = 0.35 [0.23] \u00b5g/ml; n=35, range 0.03\u20130.88 \u00b5g/ml) against clinical RSV A \nand RSV B isolates, respectively.  The majority of clinical RSV isolates tested (n=96) were collected \nfrom subjects in the United States. \n \nResistance \nPalivizumab binds a highly conserved region on the extracellular domain of mature RSV F protein, \nreferred to as antigenic site II or A antigenic site, which encompasses amino acids 262 to 275.  In a \ngenotypic analysis of 126 clinical isolates from 123 children who failed immunoprophylaxis, all RSV \nmutants that exhibited resistance to palivizumab (n=8) were shown to contain amino acid changes in \nthis region of the F protein. No polymorphic or non-polymorphic sequence variations outside of the A \nantigenic site on the RSV F protein were shown to render RSV resistant to neutralisation by \npalivizumab. At least one of the palivizumab resistance-associated substitutions, N262D, K272E/Q, or \nS275F/L was identified in these 8 clinical RSV isolates resulting in a combined resistance-associated \nmutation frequency of 6.3% in these patients.  A review of clinical findings did not reveal an \nassociation between A antigenic site sequence changes and RSV disease severity among children \nreceiving palivizumab immunoprophylaxis who develop RSV lower respiratory tract disease.  \nAnalysis of 254 clinical RSV isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-na\u00efve subjects revealed \npalivizumab resistance-associated substitutions in 2 (1 with N262D and 1 with S275F), resulting in a \nresistance associated mutation frequency of 0.79%. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibody to palivizumab was observed in approximately 1% of patients in the IMpact-RSV during the \nfirst course of therapy.  This was transient, low titre, resolved despite continued use (first and second \nseason), and could not be detected in 55 of 56 infants during the second season (including 2 with titres \nduring the first season).  Immunogenicity was not studied in the congenital heart disease study.  \nAntibody to palivizumab was evaluated in four additional studies in 4337 patients (children born at 35 \nweeks of gestation or less and 6 months of age or less, or 24 months of age or less with \nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were \nincluded in these studies) and was observed in 0% \u2013 1.5% of patients at different study timepoints.  \nThere was no association observed between the presence of antibody and adverse events.  Therefore, \nanti-drug antibody (ADA) responses appear to be of no clinical relevance. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nStudies using lyophilised palivizumab \nIn a placebo-controlled trial of RSV disease prophylaxis in (IMpact-RSV trial) 1502 high-risk children \n(1002 Synagis; 500 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg reduced the incidence of RSV related \nhospitalisation by 55% (p = < 0.001).  The RSV hospitalisation rate was 10.6% in the placebo group.  \nOn this basis, the absolute risk reduction is 5.8% which means the number needed to treat is 17 to \nprevent one hospitalisation.  The severity of RSV disease in children hospitalised despite prophylaxis \nwith palivizumab in terms of days in ICU stay per 100 children and days of mechanical ventilation per \n100 children was not affected. \n \nA total of 222 children were enrolled in two separate studies to examine the safety of palivizumab \nwhen it is administered for a second RSV season.  One hundred and three (103) children received \nmonthly palivizumab injections for the first time, and 119 children received palivizumab for two \nconsecutive seasons.  No difference between groups regarding immunogenicity was observed in either \nstudy.  However, as the efficacy of palivizumab when administered to patients as a second course of \ntreatment during an ensuing RSV season has not been formally investigated in a study performed with \nthis objective, the relevance of these data in terms of efficacy is unknown. \n \nIn an open label prospective trial designed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity \nafter administration of 7 doses of palivizumab within a single RSV season, pharmacokinetic data \nindicated that adequate mean palivizumab levels were achieved in all 18 children enrolled.  Transient, \nlow levels of antipalivizumab antibody were observed in one child after the second dose of \npalivizumab that dropped to undetectable levels at the fifth and seventh dose. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled trial in 1,287 patients \u2264 24 months of age with haemodynamically significant \ncongenital heart disease (639 Synagis; 648 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg Synagis; reduced \nthe incidence of RSV hospitalisations by 45% (p = 0.003) (congenital heart disease study).  Groups \nwere equally balanced between cyanotic and acyanotic patients.  The RSV hospitalisation rate was \n9.7% in the placebo group and 5.3% in the Synagis group.  Secondary efficacy endpoints showed \nsignificant reductions in the Synagis group compared to placebo in total days of RSV hospitalisation \n(56% reduction, p = 0.003) and total RSV days with increased supplemental oxygen (73% reduction, \np = 0.014) per 100 children. \n \nA retrospective observational study was conducted in young children with hemodynamically \nsignificant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) comparing the occurrence of primary serious adverse \nevents (PSAEs: infection, arrhythmia, and death) between those who did (1009) and did not receive \nSynagis prophylaxis (1009) matched by age, type of cardiac lesion, and prior corrective surgery.  The \nincidence of arrhythmia and death PSAEs was similar in children who did and did not receive \nprophylaxis.  The incidence of infection PSAEs was lower in children who received prophylaxis as \ncompared to those children who did not receive prophylaxis.  The results of the study indicate no \nincreased risk of serious infection, serious arrhythmia, or death in children with HSCHD associated \nwith Synagis prophylaxis compared with children who did not receive prophylaxis. \n \nStudies using liquid palivizumab \nTwo clinical studies were conducted to directly compare liquid and lyophilised formulations of \npalivizumab.  In the first study, all 153 premature infants received both formulations in different \nsequences.   In the second study, 211 and 202 premature infants or children with chronic lung disease \nreceived liquid and lyophilised palivizumab, respectively.  In two additional studies, liquid \npalivizumab was used as an active control (3918 pediatric subjects) to evaluate an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody for prophylaxis of serious RSV disease in premature infants or children with \nBPD or hemodynamically significant CHD (see below for further details of these two studies).  The \noverall rate and pattern of adverse events, study drug discontinuation due to AEs, and the number of \ndeaths reported in these clinical studies were consistent with those observed during the clinical \ndevelopment programs for the lyophilised formulation.  No deaths were considered related to \npalivizumab and no new ADRs were identified in these studies.  \n \nPre-term infants and children with Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity (CLDP): this trial, conducted \nat 347 centers in the North America, European Union and 10 other countries, studied patients less than \n\n\n\n26 \n\nor equal to 24 months of age with CLDP and patients with premature birth (less than or equal to 35 \nweeks gestation) who were less than or equal to 6 months of age at study entry.  Patients with \nhemodynamically significant congenital heart disease were excluded from enrollment in this study and \nwere studied in a separate study.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=3306) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=3329).  Subjects were followed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-\neight percent of all subjects receiving palivizumab completed the study and 97% received all five \ninjections.  The primary endpoint was the incidence of RSV hospitalisation.  RSV hospitalisations \noccurred among 62 of 3306 (1.9%) patients in the palivizumab group.  The RSV hospitalisation rate \nobserved in patients enrolled with a diagnosis of CLDP was 28/723 (3.9%) and in patients enrolled \nwith a diagnosis of prematurity without CLDP was 34/2583 (1.3%).  \n \nCHD Study 2: this trial, conducted at 162 centers in North America, European Union and 4 other \ncountries over two RSV seasons, studied patients less than or equal to 24 months of age with \nhemodynamically significant CHD.  In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 5 monthly \ninjections of 15mg/kg of liquid palivizumab (N=612) used as active control for an investigational \nmonoclonal antibody (N=624).  Subjects were stratified by cardiac lesion (cyanotic vs. other) and were \nfollowed for safety and efficacy for 150 days.  Ninety-seven percent of all subjects receiving \npalivizumab completed the study and 95% received all five injections.  The primary endpoint was a \nsummary of adverse events and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence \nof RSV hospitalisation.  The incidence of RSV hospitalisation was 16 of 612 (2.6%) in the \npalivizumab group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nLyophilised formulation of palivizumab \nIn studies in adult volunteers, palivizumab had a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a human IgG1 \nantibody with regard to volume of distribution (mean 57 ml/kg) and half-life (mean 18 days).  In \nprophylactic studies in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the mean \nhalf-life of palivizumab was 20 days and monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg achieved mean \n30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after the first \ninjection, approximately 60 \u00b5g/ml after the second injection, approximately 70 \u00b5g/ml after the third \ninjection and fourth injection.  In the congenital heart disease study, monthly intramuscular doses of \n15 mg/kg achieved mean 30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately \n55 \u00b5g/ml after the first injection and approximately 90 \u00b5g/ml after the fourth injection. \n \nAmong 139 children in the congenital heart disease study receiving palivizumab who had \ncardio-pulmonary bypass and for whom paired serum samples were available, the mean serum \npalivizumab concentration was approximately 100 \u00b5g/ml pre-cardiac bypass and declined to \napproximately 40 \u00b5g/ml after bypass. \n \nLiquid formulation of palivizumab \nThe pharmacokinetics and safety of palivizumab liquid formulation and palivizumab lyophilised \nformulation, following 15 mg/kg intramuscular administration, were compared in a cross-over trial of \n153 infants less than or equal to 6 months of age with a history of prematurity (less than or equal to 35 \nweeks gestational age).  The results of this trial indicated that the trough serum concentrations of \npalivizumab were similar between the liquid formulation and the lyophilised formulation and \nbioequivalence of the liquid and the lyophilised formulation was demonstrated. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose toxicology studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (maximum dose \n30 mg/kg), rabbits (maximum dose 50 mg/kg) and rats (maximum dose 840 mg/kg).  No significant \nfindings were observed. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nStudies carried out in rodents gave no indication of enhancement of RSV replication, or RSV-induced \npathology or generation of virus escape mutants in the presence of palivizumab under the chosen \nexperimental conditions. \n \n \n6.

After \nthe water is added, tilt the vial slightly and gently rotate the vial for 30 seconds.  \n \nDo not shake the vial.   \n \nPalivizumab solution should stand at room temperature for a minimum of 20 minutes until the solution \nclarifies. Palivizumab solution does not contain a preservative and should be administered within 3 \nhours of preparation. Single-use vial. Any remaining contents should be discarded after use. \n \nWhen reconstituted as recommended the final concentration is 100 mg/ml. \n \nPalivizumab should not be mixed with any medicinal products or diluents other than water for \ninjections. \n \nPalivizumab is administered once a month intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the \nthigh. The gluteal muscle should not be used routinely as an injection site because of the risk of \ndamage to the sciatic nerve. The injection should be given using standard aseptic technique. Injection \nvolumes over 1 ml should be given as a divided dose. \n \nWhen using Palivizumab 100 mg/ml, the volume (expressed in ml) of Palivizumab to be administered \nat one-monthly intervals = [patient weight in kg] multiplied by 0.15 \n \nFor example, for a baby with a body weight of 3 kg, the calculation becomes: \n \n(3 x 0.15) ml = 0.45 ml palivizumab per month \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nSynagis 100 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \nActive substance: palivizumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child is given this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you and your child. \n \n\u2212 Keep this leaflet.
