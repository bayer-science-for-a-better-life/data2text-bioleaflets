CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMabThera is indicated in adults for the following indications: \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nMabThera is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated adult patients with stage III-IV \nfollicular lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.  \n \nMabThera maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of adult follicular lymphoma patients \nresponding to induction therapy.  \n \nMabThera monotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy.  \n \nMabThera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMabThera in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients \n(aged ≥ 6 months  to < 18 years old) with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive diffuse \nlarge B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute \nleukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL).  \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n \nMabThera in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously \nuntreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for \npatients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including MabThera or patients refractory to \nprevious MabThera plus chemotherapy. \n \nSee section 5.1 for further information. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nMabThera in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe \nactive rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor \n(TNF) inhibitor therapies. \n \nMabThera has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis  \n \nMabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nsevere, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis \n(MPA). \n \nMabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in \npaediatric patients (aged ≥ 2 to < 18 years old) with severe, active GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nMabThera is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMabThera should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication and prophylactic medications \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of MabThera. \n \nIn adult patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should \nbe considered if MabThera is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy.  \n \nIn paediatric patients with non Hodgkin’s lymphoma, premedication with paracetamol and H1 \nantihistamine (= diphenhydramine or equivalent) should be administered 30 to 60 minutes before the \nstart of the infusion of MabThera. In addition, prednisone should be given as indicated in Table 1. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start \nof therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL \npatients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with MabThera to decrease the \nrate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, GPA or MPA or pemphigus vulgaris, premedication with 100 mg \nintravenous methylprednisolone should be completed 30 minutes prior to each infusion of MabThera \nto decrease the incidence and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs). \n \nIn adult patients with GPA or MPA, methylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose \nof 1000 mg per day is recommended prior to the first infusion of MabThera (the last dose of \nmethylprednisolone may be given on the same day as the first infusion of MabThera).  This should be \nfollowed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible \nbased on clinical need) during and after the 4 week induction course of MabThera treatment.  \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis is recommended for adult patients with \nGPA/MPA or PV during and following MabThera treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical \npractice guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn paediatric patients with GPA or MPA, prior to the first MabThera IV infusion, methylprednisolone \nshould be given IV for three daily doses of 30 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 1 g/day) to treat severe \nvasculitis symptoms. Up to three additional daily doses of 30 mg/kg IV methylprednisolone can be \ngiven prior to the first MabThera infusion. \n \nFollowing completion of IV methylprednisolone administration, patients should receive oral \nprednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 60 mg/day) and tapered as rapidly as possible per clinical need \n(see section 5.1). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis is recommended for paediatric patients with \nGPA or MPA during and following MabThera treatment, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nIt is important to check the medicinal product labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation \n(intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) is being given to the patient, as prescribed. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \n \nMabThera should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n \nMaintenance therapy \n\n• Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of MabThera used as a maintenance treatment for patients with previously \nuntreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 body surface \narea once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years (12 infusions in total). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of MabThera used as a maintenance treatment for patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 \nbody surface area once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until \ndisease progression or for a maximum period of two years (8 infusions in total). \n \nMonotherapy \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of MabThera monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for four weeks.  \n \nFor retreatment with MabThera monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith MabThera monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n(see section 5.1).  \n \nAdult Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nMabThera should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of MabThera \nhave not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of MabThera are recommended. When MabThera is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nThe recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \nand relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first \ntreatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent \ncycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after MabThera infusion. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nPatients treated with MabThera must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nA course of MabThera consists of two 1000 mg intravenous infusions. The recommended dosage of \nMabThera is 1000 mg by intravenous infusion followed by a second 1000 mg intravenous infusion \ntwo weeks later. \n \nThe need for further courses should be evaluated 24 weeks following the previous course. Retreatment \nshould be given at that time if residual disease activity remains, otherwise retreatment should be \ndelayed until disease activity returns. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 16 - 24 weeks of an initial \ntreatment course. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no \nevidence of therapeutic benefit within this time period. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n \nPatients treated with MabThera must be given the patient alert card with each infusion.  \n \nAdult induction of remission \nThe recommended dosage of MabThera for induction of remission therapy  in adult patients with GPA \nand MPA is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 \nweeks (four infusions in total).  \n \nAdult maintenance treatment \nFollowing induction of remission with MabThera, maintenance treatment in adult patients with GPA \nand MPA should be initiated no sooner than 16 weeks after the last MabThera infusion. \n \nFollowing induction of remission with other standard of care immunosuppressants, MabThera \nmaintenance treatment should be initiated during the 4 week period that follows disease remission.  \n \nMabThera should be administered as two 500 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, followed by a \n500 mg IV infusion every 6 months thereafter. Patients should receive MabThera for at least 24 \nmonths after achievement of remission (absence of clinical signs and symptoms).  For patients who \nmay be at higher risk for relapse, physicians should consider a longer duration of MabThera \nmaintenance therapy, up to 5 years.  \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nPatients treated with MabThera must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of MabThera for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris is 1000 mg \nadministered as an IV infusion followed two weeks later by a second 1000 mg IV infusion in \ncombination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nA maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 \nmonths thereafter if needed, based on clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment of relapse \nIn the event of relapse, patients may receive 1000 mg IV.  The healthcare provider should also \nconsider resuming or increasing the patient’s glucocorticoid dose based on clinical evaluation.  \n \nSubsequent infusions may be administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nIn paediatric patients from ≥ 6 months to < 18 years of age with previously untreated, advanced stage \nCD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL, MabThera should be used in combination with systemic \nLymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy (see Tables 1 and 2). The recommended dosage of \nMabThera is 375mg/m2 BSA, administered as an IV infusion. No MabThera dose adjustments, other \nthan by BSA, are required. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of MabThera paediatric patients ≥ 6 months to < 18 years of age has not been \nestablished in indications other than previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive \nDLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. Only limited data are available for patients under 3 years of age. See section \n5.1 for further information.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMabThera should not be used in paediatric patients from birth to < 6 months of age with CD20 \npositive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (see section 5.1) \n \nTable 1 Posology of MabThera administration for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma paediatric \n\npatients \nCycle Day of treatment Administration details \n\nPrephase (COP) No MabThera given - \n\nInduction course 1 \n(COPDAM1) \n\nDay -2 \n(corresponding to day 6 \nof the prephase) \n1st MabThera infusion \n\n \nDuring the 1st induction course, prednisone is \ngiven as part of the chemotherapy course, and \nshould be administered prior to MabThera. \n\nDay 1 \n2nd MabThera infusion \n\n \nMabThera will be given 48 hours after thefirst \ninfusion of MabThera. \n\nInduction course 2 \n(COPDAM2) \n\nDay -2 \n3rd MabThera infusion \n\n \nIn the 2nd induction course, prednisone is not \ngiven at the time of MabThera administration. \n\nDay 1 \n4th MabThera infusion \n\n \nMabThera will be given 48 hours after the third \ninfusion of MabThera. \n\nConsolidation \ncourse 1 \n(CYM/CYVE) \n\nDay 1 \n5th MabThera infusion \n\n \nPrednisone is not given at the time of MabThera \nadministration. \n\nConsolidation \ncourse 2 \n(CYM/CYVE) \n\nDay 1 \n6th MabThera infusion \n\n \nPrednisone is not given at the time of MabThera \nadministration. \n\nMaintenance \ncourse 1 (M1) \n\nDay 25 to 28 of \nconsolidation course 2 \n(CYVE) \nNo MabThera given \n\n \nStarts when peripheral counts have recovered \nfrom consolidation course 2 (CYVE) with ANC> \n1.0 x 109/l and platelets > 100 x 109/l  \n\nMaintenance \ncourse 2 (M2) \n\nDay 28 of maintenance \ncourse 1 (M1) \nNo MabThera given \n\n- \n\nANC = Absolute Neutrophil Count; COP = Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Prednisone; COPDAM = Cyclophosphamide, \nVincristine, Prednisolone, Doxorubicin, Methotrexate; CYM = CYtarabine (Aracytine, Ara-C), Methotrexate; CYVE = \nCYtarabine (Aracytine, Ara-C), VEposide (VP16)  \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2 Treatment Plan for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma paediatric patients: Concomitant \nChemotherapy with MabThera  \n\nTreatment \nPlan \n\nPatient Staging Administration details \n\nGroup B Stage III with high LDH level (> N x \n2), \nStage IV CNS negative \n\nPrephase followed by 4 courses:  \n2 induction courses (COPADM) with \nHDMTX 3g/m2 and 2 consolidation courses \n(CYM)  \n\nGroup C Group C1: \nB- AL CNS negative, Stage IV & BAL \nCNS positive and CSF negative \n\nPrephase followed by 6 courses:  \n2 induction courses (COPADM) with \nHDMTX 8g/m², 2 consolidation courses \n(CYVE) and 2 maintenance courses  (M1 \nand M2)  \n\nGroup C3: \nBAL CSF positive, Stage IV CSF \npositive \n\nConsecutive courses should be given as soon as blood count recovery and patient’s condition allows \nexcept for the maintenance courses which are given at 28 day intervals \nBAL = Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia); CSF = Cerebrospinal  Fluid; CNS = Central Nervous System; \nHDMTX = High-dose Methotrexate; LDH = Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase \n\n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \nInduction of remission \nThe recommended dosage of MabThera for induction of remission therapy in paediatric patients with \nsevere, active GPA or MPA is 375 mg/m2 BSA, administered as an IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of MabThera in paediatric patients (≥ 2 to < 18 years of age) has not been \nestablished in indications other than severe, active GPA or MPA. \nMabThera should not be used in paediatric patients less than 2 years of age with severe, active GPA or \nMPA as there is a possibility of an inadequate immune response towards childhood vaccinations \nagainst common, vaccine preventable childhood diseases (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, and \npoliomyelitis) (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prepared MabThera solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a \ndedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory tests \nand, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be restarted \nuntil complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest X-ray \nfindings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the previous rate. \nIf the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the treatment should \nbe seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRR) (section 4.8) usually respond to a reduction in the \nrate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of symptoms.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in \n50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions  \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of MabThera can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nPaediatric patients – non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFirst infusion  \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 0.5 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it can be escalated by \n0.5 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes if there is no hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions, to a \nmaximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions  \n \nSubsequent doses of MabThera can be infused at an initial rate of 1 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it \ncan be increased by 1 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis only  \n \nAlternative subsequent, faster, infusion schedule \n \nIf patients did not experience a serious infusion-related reaction with their first or subsequent infusions \nof a dose of 1000 mg MabThera administered over the standard infusion schedule, a more rapid \ninfusion can be administered for second and subsequent infusions using the same concentration as in \nprevious infusions (4 mg/mL in a 250 mL volume). Initiate at a rate of 250 mg/hour for the first 30 \nminutes and then 600 mg/hour for the next 90 minutes. If the more rapid infusion is tolerated, this \ninfusion schedule can be used when administering subsequent infusions. \n \nPatients who have clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmias, or previous \nserious infusion reactions to any prior biologic therapy or to rituximab, should not be administered the \nmore rapid infusion. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n   \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n \nAll patients treated with MabThera for rheumatoid arthritis, GPA, MPA or pemphigus vulgaris must \nbe given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card contains important safety information \nfor patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, including progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML). \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following use of MabThera. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a Neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered.  \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of MabThera must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and \nsuspension of MabThera therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nMabThera is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from \nacute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. They are not specifically related to \nthe route of administration of MabThera and can be observed with both formulations. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of \nthe MabThera intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first MabThera intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and in \nsome cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, \nchills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, \nvisible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating \nthe first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour \ninfiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. \nPatients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted \nimmediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial \nimprovement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely \nmonitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. \nFurther treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in \nrepeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant cells \nsuch as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, \nshould be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout \nthe first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first \ninfusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent \ncycles if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion-related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nMabThera (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10% of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \nMabThera infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic and occasionally oxygen, \nintravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release \nsyndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of \nhypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be \navailable for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of MabThera. \nClinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine \nrelease syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less \nfrequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during MabThera administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the MabThera infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with MabThera. Therefore patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough MabThera is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L as \nclinical experience in this population is limited. MabThera has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable reduced \nbone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nMabThera therapy.  \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with MabThera (see section 4.8). \nMabThera should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of MabThera in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to \nserious infection (see section 4.8).  \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving MabThera including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nMabThera treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with MabThera. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be \ntreated with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should \nconsult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following \nlocal medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of MabThera in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \nreceived MabThera in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant.  \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following MabThera therapy has not been studied \nfor NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients \ntreated with MabThera may receive non-live vaccinations; however, with non-live vaccines response \nrates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, adult patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who \nreceived MabThera monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate of \nresponse to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin \n(KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). For CLL \npatients, similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but that has not \nbeen investigated in clinical trials. \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with MabThera.  \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to MabThera, treatment should be permanently discontinued.  \n \nPaediatric population \nOnly limited data are available for patients under 3 years of age. See section 5.1 for further \ninformation. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), \nand pemphigus vulgaris \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of MabThera is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nMabThera is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators.  \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, \npruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion \nof patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following \nthe second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses \n(see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or \ninterruption, of MabThera infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, \noccasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely \nmonitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue MabThera. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely \nresolved. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of MabThera.  \n \nThere are no data on the safety of MabThera in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with MabThera, the occurrence of \npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with MabThera \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during MabThera \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to \nthe MabThera infusion. \n \nIRRs in patients with GPA, MPA and pemphigus vulgaris were consistent with those seen for \nrheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with MabThera. Therefore, patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion-related reactions, above). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of MabThera and the knowledge that B cells play an important role \nin maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nMabThera therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith MabThera (see section 4.8). MabThera should not be administered to patients with an active, \nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of MabThera in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with MabThera. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following MabThera therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of MabThera treatment, \npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of MabThera for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B Infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, GPA and MPA patients receiving MabThera. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith MabThera. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nLate neutropenia \nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of MabThera, and regularly up to 6-months after \ncessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8).  \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event \nwith a suspected relationship to MabThera, treatment should be permanently discontinued.  \n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and  patients should, if possible, be brought \nup-to-date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to \ninitiating MabThera therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first \nadministration of MabThera. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following MabThera therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on MabThera or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted.  \n \nPatients treated with MabThera may receive non-live vaccinations; however, response rates to \nnon-live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \nMabThera and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), \nreduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal \nantibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after MabThera as \ncompared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst \n\n\n\n15 \n\nreceiving MabThera therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next \ncourse of MabThera.  \n \nIn the overall experience of MabThera repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, \nvaricella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline.  \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of MabThera and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following MabThera (see section 4.5). The \navailable data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such therapies \nare used in patients previously treated with MabThera, however patients should be closely observed \nfor signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following MabThera therapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory drugs may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited experience \nwith MabThera in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data do not seem to \nsuggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the development of solid \ntumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \nExcipients  \nThis medicinal product contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 mL vial and 11.5 mmol (or \n263.2 mg) sodium per 50 mL vial, equivalent to 2.6% (for 10ml vial) and 13.2% (for 50ml vial) of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with MabThera.  \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with MabThera did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of MabThera. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of MabThera in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal \nantibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following MabThera. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \nMabThera was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment \nwith the biologic DMARD.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following treatment \nwith MabThera. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \n \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to MabThera have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to MabThera during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons MabThera should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should \nnot breastfeed while treated with MabThera and for 12 months following MabThera treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of MabThera on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that MabThera \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adults \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of MabThera in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith MabThera monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy.  \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving MabThera were IRRs \nwhich occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of infusion-related \nsymptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after eight doses of \nMabThera. \n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of patients \nduring clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials in patients \nwith CLL. \n \nThe most frequently reported or observed serious adverse reactions were: \n• IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n• Infections, see section 4.4. \n• Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.).  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with MabThera alone or in combination with chemotherapy are \nsummarised in Table 3. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (≥  1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be \nestimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTable 3 ADRs reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing surveillance in patients \n\nwith NHL and CLL disease treated with MabThera monotherapy/maintenance or in \ncombination with chemotherapy  \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfections, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis  \n \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile infection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory tract \ninfection, fungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, +acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1  \n\n serious viral \ninfection2 \nPneumocystis \njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocytop\nenia \n \n\nanaemia,  \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopenia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, aplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenopathy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia\n3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion-\nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine release \nsyndrome4, \nserum sickness \n\ninfusion-rel\nated acute \nreversible \nthrombocyt\nopenia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia, \nweight decrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, increased \nLDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, anxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \npalsy5 \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of \nother \nsenses5 \n\nEye \ndisorders \n\n lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear pain    hearing \nloss5 \n\n\n\n18 \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, +atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac disorder \n\n+left ventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventricular \ntachycardia,  \n+ventricular \ntachycardia,  \n+angina,  \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nsevere cardiac \ndisorders 4 and \n6 \n\nheart failure4 and \n6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension  \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominately \ncutaneous), \nleukocytoclastic \nvasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased cough, \nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, lung \ndisorder, hypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4 \n \n\nlung \ninfiltration  \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nnausea  vomiting, \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestinal \nperforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneou\ns tissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, rash, \n+alopecia  \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \nskin reactions, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, \ntoxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome) 7  \n\n \n\nMusculoskel\netal, \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\n\n\n19 \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem \nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nGeneral \ndisorders \nand \nadministrati\non site \nconditions \n\nfever, chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache  \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, malaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering,  \n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site pain    \n\nInvestigation\ns \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked with \n\"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of MabThera \n\ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated with \n\ninfusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were \nreported at a similar or lower incidence in the MabThera arms compared to control arms: \nhaematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% of \npatients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the first one \nto two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included \nflushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat \nirritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, \nasthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related reactions (such as \nbronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases.  \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions such \nas angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, myocardial \ninfarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis syndrome, cytokine \nrelease syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or unknown frequencies. \nThe incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions and is \n<1% of patients by the eighth cycle of MabThera (containing) treatment.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections  \nMabThera induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased \nserum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients.  \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the \nMabThera-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of \npatients treated with MabThera monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including \ngrade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during MabThera maintenance treatment up to 2 years when \ncompared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a \n2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or \nexacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with MabThera treatment. The majority of \npatients had received MabThera in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem \ncell transplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses \n\n\n\n20 \n\n(Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease \nprogression and retreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, \nhave been reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving MabThera in combination with \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatitis \nB infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% FC. Progression of Kaposi’s \nsarcoma has been observed in MabThera-exposed patients with pre-existing Kaposi’s sarcoma. These \ncases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions  \nIn clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia \nwas reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During \nMabThera maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1%, grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with MabThera in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the higher \nincidence of neutropenia in patients treated with MabThera and chemotherapy was not associated with \na higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with chemotherapy \nalone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established that in up to 25% \nof patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil count remaining \nbelow 1x109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late onset (defined as \nneutrophil count below 1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with no previous \nprolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with MabThera plus FC. \nThere were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia \noccurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of MabThera were reported. In the CLL \nfirst-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm compared to \nthe FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 \nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \nthe FC group.  \n \nIn studies of MabThera in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline \nlevel within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with MabThera and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with MabThera compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating MabThera in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a MabThera \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \n\n\n\n21 \n\nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC).  \n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders  \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2%) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low both \nin the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% FC).  \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nMabThera for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, MabThera was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating MabThera maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the MabThera groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the MabThera group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the MabThera group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with MabThera, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - MabThera monotherapy \nElderly (≥ 65 years):  \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3/4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to \nyounger patients (<65 years).  \n \nBulky disease  \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6% vs. 15.4%). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of MabThera was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n \nPatient subpopulations - MabThera combination therapy \nElderly (≥ 65 years)  \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (<65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL. \n \nExperience from paediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nA multicenter, open-label randomized study of Lymphome Malin B chemotherapy (LMB) with or \nwithout MabThera was conducted in paediatric patients (aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years old) with \npreviously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL.  \n \nA total of 309 paediatric patients received MabThera and were included in the safety analysis \npopulation. Paediatric patients randomized to the LMB chemotherapy arm with MabThera, or enrolled \nin the single arm part of the study, were administered MabThera at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA and \nreceived a total of six IV infusions of MabThera (two during each of the two induction courses and \none during each of the two consolidation courses of the LMB  scheme).  \n \nThe safety profile of MabThera in paediatric patients (aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years old) with \npreviously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL was generally consistent in \ntype, nature and severity with the known safety profile in adult NHL and CLL patients.    Addition of \nMabThera to chemotherapy did result in an increased risk of some events including infections \n(including sepsis) compared to chemotherapy only.   \n \nExperience from rheumatoid arthritis  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of MabThera in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of MabThera in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; approximately \n2400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1000 having received 5 or more \ncourses. The safety information collected during post marketing experience reflects the expected \nadverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for MabThera (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients received 2 x 1000 mg of MabThera separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). MabThera infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 4. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of MabThera were IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during the \n\n\n\n23 \n\ninitial course.  In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for MabThera, progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like reaction have been \nreported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 4 Summary of adverse reactions reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing \n\nsurveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving MabThera  \nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common \nUncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nupper respiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nbronchitis, sinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, tinea \npedispedís \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n neutropenia1  late \nneutropenia2 \n\nserum \nsickness-like \nreaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n3infusion-related \nreactions \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \npyrexia, pruritus, \nurticaria, throat \nirritation, hot flush,  \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, fatigue, \noropharyngeal pain, \nperipheral oedema, \nerythema) \n\n 3infusion related \nreactions \n(generalized \noedema, \nbronchospasm, \nwheezing, \nlaryngeal oedema, \nangioneurotic \noedema, \ngeneralized \npruritus, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoid \nreaction) \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Hypercholesterolem\nia \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric disorders  depression, anxiety    \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \nmigraine, dizziness, \nsciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders    angina \npectoris, atrial \nfibrillation, \nheart failure, \nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\natrial flutter \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspepsia, \ndiarrhoea, \ngastro-oesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome), \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome5 \n\nMusculo skeletal \ndisorders and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, osteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

The rate of all ADRs following first MabThera exposure was highest during the first 6 \nmonths and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the first \ntreatment course), RA exacerbation and infections, all of which were more frequent in the first 6 \nmonths of treatment.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of MabThera in clinical studies were IRRs (refer to \nTable 4). Among the 3189 patients treated with MabThera, 1135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR \nwith 733/3189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nMabThera. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% \n(17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths due \nto IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events and of IRRs leading to withdrawal \ndecreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with intravenous \nglucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid MabThera infusion in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious IRR \nduring or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour intravenous \ninfusion of MabThera. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic therapy for \nRA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent with that \nobserved historically.  No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in MabThera treated patients. \nThe infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract \ninfections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious or required IV \nantibiotics was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections did not show any \nsignificant increase following multiple courses of MabThera. Lower respiratory tract infections \n(including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence in the \nMabThera arms compared to control arms. \n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported following \nuse of MabThera for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid arthritis and \noff-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving MabThera in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma).  \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in RA patients receiving \nMabThera (see Section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the MabThera treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with MabThera treatment, the majority of which were transient \nand mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the administration of \nMabThera (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of MabThera treated patients and \n0.27% (2/731) of placebo patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with MabThera. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4).  \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with MabThera, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nExperience from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n \nAdult induction of remission (GPA/MPA Study 1)  \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, 99 adult patients were treated for induction of remission of GPA and MPA \nwith MabThera (375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 5 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the \nMabThera group and at a higher frequency than the comparator group. \n \nTable 5 Adverse reactions occurring at 6-months in ≥ 5% of adult patients receiving \n\nMabThera in GPA/MPA Study 1, and at a higher frequency than the comparator \ngroup. \n\nMedDRA System organ class \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab \n(n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n system disorder \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \n\n\n\n26 \n\nMedDRA System organ class \nAdverse reaction \n\nRituximab \n(n=99) \n\nNervous system disorders \nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \nMusculoskeletal and connective  \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nAdult maintenance treatment (GPA/MPA Study 2) \nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, a total of 57 adult patients with severe, active GPA and MPA were treated with \nMabThera for the maintenance of remission (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 6 Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of adult patients receiving MabThera in \nGPA/MPA Study 2, and at a higher frequency than the comparator group \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class \nAdverse  reaction \n\nRituximab  \n(n=57) \n\nInfections and infestations   \nBronchitis 14% \nRhinitis 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea 9% \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nDiarrhoea 7% \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\n \n\nPyrexia 9% \nInfluenza-like illness 5% \nOedema peripheral 5% \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions1 12% \n1Details on infusion related reactions are provided in the description of selected adverse reactions \nsection. \n\n \nThe overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile for MabThera in \napproved autoimmune indications, including GPA/MPA. Overall, 4% of patients in the MabThera arm \nexperienced adverse events leading to discontinuation. Most adverse events in the MabThera arm were \nmild or moderate in intensity.  No patients in the MabThera arm had fatal adverse events. \n \nThe most commonly reported events considered as ADRs were infusion-related reactions and \ninfections.   \n \nLong-term follow-up (GPA/MPA Study 3) \nIn a long-term observational safety study, 97 GPA/MPA patients received treatment with MabThera \n(mean of 8 infusions [range 1-28]) for up to 4 years, according to their physician’s standard practice \nand discretion.  The overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile of \nMabThera in RA and GPA/MPA and no new adverse reactions were reported.    \n \nPaediatric population  \nAn open-label, single arm study was conducted in 25 paediatric patients with severe, active GPA or \nMPA.  The overall study period consisted of a 6-month remission induction phase with a minimum \n18-month follow-up, up to 4.5 years overall.  During the follow-up phase, MabThera was given at the \ndiscretion of the investigator (17 out of 25 patients received additional MabThera treatment).  \nConcomitant treatment with other immunosuppressive therapy was permitted (see section 5.1). \n \nADRs were considered as adverse events that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 10%.  These included: \ninfections (17 patients [68%] in the remission induction phase; 23 patients [92%] in the overall study \nperiod), IRRs (15 patients [60%] in the remission induction phase; 17 patients [68%] in the overall \nstudy period), and nausea (4 patients [16%] in the remission induction phase; 5 patients [20%] in the \noverall study period).    \n \nDuring the overall study period, the safety profile of MabThera was consistent with that reported \nduring the remission induction phase. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe safety profile of MabThera in paediatric GPA or MPA patients was consistent in type, nature and \nseverity with the known safety profile in adult patients in the approved autoimmune indications, \nincluding adult GPA or MPA.    \n \nDescription of selected adverse  reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1 (adult induction of remission study), IRRs were defined as any adverse event \noccurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in the \nsafety population. Of the 99 patients treated with MabThera, 12 (12%) experienced at least one IRR. \nAll IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release syndrome, \nflushing, throat irritation, and tremor. MabThera was given in combination with intravenous \nglucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. \n \nIn GPA/MPA Study 2 (adult maintenance study), 7/57 (12%) patients in the MabThera arm \nexperienced at least one infusion-related reaction.  The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during \nor after the first infusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (<4%). All IRR symptoms \nwere mild or moderate and most of them were reported from the SOCs Respiratory, Thoracic and \nMediastinal Disorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue disorders.  \n \nIn the clinical trial in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA, the reported IRRs were predominantly seen \nwith the first infusion (8 patients [32%]), and then decreased over time with the number of MabThera \ninfusions (20% with the second infusion, 12% with the third infusion and 8% with the fourth infusion).  \nThe most common IRR symptoms reported during the remission induction phase were: headache, rash, \nrhinorrhea and pyrexia (8%, for each symptom).  The observed symptoms of IRRs were similar to those \nknown in adult GPA or MPA patients treated with MabThera.  The majority of IRRs were Grade 1 and \nGrade 2, there were two non-serious Grade 3 IRRs, and no Grade 4 or 5 IRRs reported.  One serious \nGrade 2 IRR (generalized oedema which resolved with treatment) was reported in one patient (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nInfections  \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% \nCI 197 - 285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and \nconsisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The \nrate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported \nserious infection in the MabThera group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n \nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, 30/57 (53%) patients in the MabThera arm experienced infections. The \nincidence of all grade infections was similar between the arms. Infections were predominately mild to \nmoderate. The most common infections in the MabThera arm included upper respiratory tract \ninfections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. The incidence of serious \ninfections was similar in both arms (approximately 12%). The most commonly reported serious \ninfection in the MabThera group was mild or moderate bronchitis. \n \nIn the clinical trial in paediatric patients with severe, active GPA and MPA, 91% of reported infections \nwere non-serious and 90% were mild to moderate.  \n \nThe most common infections in the overall phase were: upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) \n(48%), influenza (24%), conjunctivitis (20%), nasopharyngitis (20%), lower respiratory tract \ninfections (16%), sinusitis (16%), viral URTIs (16%), ear infection (12%), gastroenteritis (12%), \npharyngitis (12%), urinary tract infection (12%).  Serious infections were reported in 7 patients (28%), \nand included: influenza (2 patients [8%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (2 patients [8%]) as the \nmost frequently reported events. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nMalignancies \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, the incidence of malignancy in MabThera treated patients in the GPA and \nMPA clinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final \npatient had completed the follow-up period).  On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the \nincidence of malignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in patients with \nANCA-associated vasculitis. \n \nIn the paediatric clinical trial, no malignancies were reported with a follow-up period of up to 54 \nmonths. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years \n(95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint.  The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per \n100 patient years (95% CI 3 -15).  The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and \natrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nHepatitis-B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis-B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving MabThera in the \npostmarketing setting. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \nadult and pediatric GPA and MPA patients treated with MabThera.  \n \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, at 6 months, in the MabThera group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with \nnormal immunoglobulin levels at baseline had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively, compared to \n25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group. The rate of overall infections and serious \ninfections was not increased after the development of low IgA, IgG or IgM. \n \nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, no clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms or \ndecreases in total immunoglobulin, IgG, IgM or IgA levels were observed throughout the trial. \n \nIn the paediatric clinical trial, during the overall study period, 3/25 (12%) patients reported an event of \nhypogammaglobulinaemia, 18 patients (72%) had prolonged (defined as Ig levels below lower limit of \nnormal for at least 4 months) low IgG levels (of whom 15 patients also had prolonged low IgM).  \nThree patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IV-IG).  Based on limited data, \nno firm conclusions can be drawn regarding whether prolonged low IgG and IgM led to an increased \nrisk of serious infection in these patients. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n\nNeutropenia \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, 24% of patients in the MabThera group (single course) and 23% of patients in \nthe cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not \nassociated with an observed increase in serious infection in MabThera-treated patients.   \n \nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, the incidence of all-grade neutropenia was 0% for MabThera-treated patients \nvs 5% for azathioprine treated patients. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nExperience from pemphigus vulgaris \n \nSummary of the safety profile in PV Study 1 (Study ML22196) and PV Study 2 (Study WA29330) \nThe safety profile of MabThera in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoids in the \ntreatment of patients with pemphigus vulgaris was studied in a Phase 3, randomised, controlled, \nmulticenter, open-label study in pemphigus patients that included 38 pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients \nrandomised to the MabThera group (PV Study 1). Patients randomised to the MabThera group \nreceived an initial 1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15. \nMaintenance doses of 500 mg IV were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients could receive \n1000 mg IV at the time of relapse (see section 5.1).   \n \nIn PV Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, multicenter study \nevaluating the efficacy and safety of MabThera compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in \npatients with moderate-to-severe PV requiring oral corticosteroids, 67 PV patients received treatment \nwith MabThera (initial 1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15 \nrepeated at Weeks 24 and 26) for up to 52 weeks (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe safety profile of MabThera in PV was consistent with the established safety profile in other \napproved autoimmune indications.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions for PV Studies 1 and 2 \nAdverse reactions from PV Studies 1 and 2 are presented in Table 7. In PV Study 1, ADRs were \ndefined as adverse events which occurred at a rate of  ≥ 5% among MabThera-treated PV patients, \nwith a  ≥ 2% absolute difference in incidence between the MabThera-treated group and the standard-\ndose prednisone group up to month 24.  No patients were withdrawn due to ADRs  in Study 1. In PV \nStudy 2, ADRs were defined as adverse events occurring in ≥5% of patients in the MabThera arm and \nassessed as related. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTable 7 Adverse reactions in MabThera-treated pemphigus vulgaris patients in PV Study 1 \n(up to Month 24) and PV Study 2 (up to Week 52) \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Very Common Common \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infection Herpes virus infection \n\nHerpes zoster \nOral herpes \nConjunctivitis \nNasopharyngitis \nOral candidiasis \nUrinary tract infection \n\nNeoplasms Benign, Malignant and \nUnspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \n\n Skin papilloma \n\nPsychiatric disorders Persistent depressive disorder Major depression \nIrritability \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n \n\nDizziness \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \nGastrointestinal disorders  Abdominal pain upper \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Alopecia Pruritus \n\nUrticaria \nSkin disorder \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and \nbone disorders \n\n Musculoskeletal pain \nArthralgia \nBack pain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n Fatigue \nAsthenia \nPyrexia \n\nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural \nComplications \n\nInfusion-related reactions*  \n\n*Infusion-related reactions for PV Study 1 included symptoms collected on the next scheduled visit after each infusion, \nand adverse events occurring on the day of or one day after the infusion.  The most common infusion-related reaction \nsymptoms/Preferred Terms for PV Study 1 included headaches, chills, high blood pressure, nausea, asthenia and pain. \n \nThe most common infusion-related reaction symptoms/Preferred Terms for PV Study 2 were dyspnoea, erythema, \nhyperhidrosis, flushing/hot flush, hypotension/low blood pressure and rash/rash pruritic. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nIn PV Study 1, infusion-related reactions were common (58%). Nearly all infusion-related reactions \nwere mild to moderate. The proportion of patients experiencing an infusion- related reaction was 29% \n(11 patients), 40% (15 patients), 13% (5 patients), and 10% (4 patients) following the first, second, \nthird, and fourth infusions, respectively. No patients were withdrawn from treatment due to infusion-\nrelated reactions.  Symptoms of infusion-related reactions were similar in type and severity to those \nseen in RA and GPA/MPA patients. \n \nIn PV Study 2, IRRs occurred primarily at the first infusion and the frequency of IRRs decreased with \nsubsequent infusions: 17.9%, 4.5%, 3% and 3% of patients experienced IRRs at the first, second, third, \nand fourth infusions, respectively.  In 11/15 patients who experienced at least one IRR, the IRRs were \nGrade 1 or 2.  In 4/15 patients, Grade ≥3 IRRs were reported and led to discontinuation of MabThera \ntreatment; three of the four patients experienced serious (life-threatening) IRRs.  Serious IRRs \noccurred at the first (2 patients) or second (1 patient) infusion and resolved with symptomatic \ntreatment.   \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nInfections \nIn PV Study 1, 14 patients (37%) in the MabThera group experienced treatment-related infections \ncompared to 15 patients (42%) in the standard-dose prednisone group. The most common infections in \nthe MabThera group were herpes simplex and zoster infections, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, \nfungal infection and conjunctivitis. Three patients (8%) in the MabThera group experienced a total of \n5 serious infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, infective thrombosis, intervertebral discitis, \nlung infection, Staphylococcal sepsis) and one patient (3%) in the standard-dose prednisone group \nexperienced a serious infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia).  \n \nIn PV Study 2, 42 patients (62.7%) in the MabThera arm experienced infections.  The most common \ninfections in the MabThera group were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, oral \ncandidiasis and urinary tract infection.  Six patients (9%) in the MabThera arm experienced serious \ninfections. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nPV Study 2, in the MabThera arm, transient decreases in lymphocyte count, driven by decreases in the \nperipheral T-cell populations, as well as a transient decrease in phosphorus level were very commonly \nobserved post-infusion. These were considered to be induced by IV methylprednisolone premedication \ninfusion. \n \nIn PV Study 2, low IgG levels were commonly observed and low IgM levels were very commonly \nobserved; however, there was no evidence of an increased risk of serious infections after the \ndevelopment of low IgG or IgM. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous MabThera formulation is \navailable from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of MabThera tested in humans \nto date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No additional \nsafety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn the postmarketing setting five cases of MabThera overdose have been reported. Three cases had no \nreported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a \ndose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C02 \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95 % of all \nB cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n33 \n\nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalise upon \nantibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free \nantigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the \nsurface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD 20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of MabThera. In \npatients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment \nand generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in \nsome patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction \ntherapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood was \nobserved following two infusions of 1000 mg MabThera separated by a 14-day interval. Peripheral \nblood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation is observed in the \nmajority of patients by week 40, whether MabThera was administered as monotherapy or in \ncombination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged peripheral B cell \ndepletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of MabThera. In patients with GPA or MPA, the \nnumber of peripheral blood B cells decreased to <10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab \n375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month timepoint. The majority of \npatients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts >10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to \n87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses  \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of MabThera as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48 % (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42 % partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58 % \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. Neither \nage, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or high \nLDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher’s exact test) on \nresponse to MabThera. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and \nbone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to \n59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a \nstepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic \nfactors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky \ndisease. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses  \nIn a multi-centre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of MabThera as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% – 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses  \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of MabThera as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36 % (CI95% 21% – 51%; CR 3%, PR 33%) \nwith a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses  \nIn a multi-centre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of MabThera, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of MabThera as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of MabThera before enrolment and thus were given a third course in \nthe study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the ORR \nwas 38% (CI95% 26% – 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding patients \nof 17.8 months (range 5.4 – 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after the prior \ncourse of MabThera (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n \nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days \n1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or MabThera 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). \nMabThera was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 \nR-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow-up of patients \nwas 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, time to \ntreatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of patients with \na tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< 0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP \ngroup (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP significantly prolonged the time \nto disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively \n(p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and \nwas 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).  \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were 80.9% \nfor patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1% for patients in the CVP group. \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using MabThera in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1078 patients responded \nto induction therapy, of which 1018 were randomised to MabThera maintenance therapy (n=505) or \nobservation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to baseline \ncharacteristics and disease status. MabThera maintenance treatment consisted of a single infusion of \nMabThera at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease progression or for a \nmaximum period of two years.  \n \nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months from \nrandomization, maintenance therapy with MabThera resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically \nsignificant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-free survival \n(PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (Table 9).  \n \nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with MabThera was also seen for the secondary \nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 9).  \n \nData from extended follow-up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the long-\nterm benefit of MabThera maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT and TNCT (Table 9). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 9 Overview of efficacy results for MabThera maintenance vs. observation at the \nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis \n(median FU: 25 months) \n\nFinal analysis \n(median FU: 9.0 years) \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nMabThera \nN=505 \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nMabThera \nN=505 \n\nPrimary efficacy     \nProgression-free survival (median) NR NR 4.06 years 10.49 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n50% \n\n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n39% \n\nSecondary efficacy     \nOverall survival (median) NR NR NR NR \nlog-rank p value 0.7246 0.7948 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n11% \n\n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n-6% \n\nEvent-free survival (median) 38 months NR 4.04 years 9.25 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n46% \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n36% \n\nTNLT (median) NR NR 6.11 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0003 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n39% \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n34% \n\nTNCT (median) NR NR 9.32 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0011 0.0004 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n40% \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n39% \n\nOverall response rate* 55% 74% 61% 79% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.33 (1.73, 3.15) 2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate* 48% 67% 53% 67% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.21 (1.65, 2.94) 2.34 (1.80, 3.03)  \n\n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.  \nFU: follow-up; NR: not reached at time of clinical cut off, TNCT: time to next chemotherapy treatment; TNLT: time to next \nanti lymphoma treatment. \n \nMabThera maintenance treatment provided consistent benefit in all predefined subgroups tested: \ngender (male, female), age (< 60 years, >= 60 years), FLIPI score (<=1, 2 or >= 3), induction therapy \n(R-CHOP, R-CVP or R-FCM) and regardless of the quality of response to induction treatment (CR, \nCRu or PR). Exploratory analyses of the benefit of maintenance treatment showed a less pronounced \neffect in elderly patients (> 70 years of age), however sample sizes were small. \n \nRelapsed/Refractory follicular lymphoma  \n \nIn a prospective, open label, international, multi-centre, phase III trial, 465 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma were randomised in a first step to induction therapy with \neither CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone; n=231) or MabThera plus \nCHOP (R-CHOP, n=234). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to baseline \ncharacteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial remission \nfollowing induction therapy were randomised in a second step to MabThera maintenance therapy \n(n=167) or observation (n=167). MabThera maintenance treatment consisted of a single infusion of \nMabThera at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 3 months until disease progression or for a \nmaximum period of two years.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nThe final efficacy analysis included all patients randomised to both parts of the study. After a median \nobservation time of 31 months for patients randomised to the induction phase, R-CHOP significantly \nimproved the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma when compared to \nCHOP (see Table 10). \n \nTable 10 Induction phase: overview of efficacy results for CHOP vs. R-CHOP (31 months \n\nmedian observation time)  \n CHOP R-CHOP p-value Risk Reduction1) \n\nPrimary efficacy      \nORR2) 74 % 87 % 0.0003 Na \n\nCR2) 16 % 29 % 0.0005 Na \nPR2) 58 % 58 % 0.9449 Na \n\n1) Estimates were calculated by hazard ratios \n2) Last tumour response as assessed by the investigator.

The median PFS was 42.2 months in the MabThera maintenance arm \ncompared to 14.3 months in the observation arm. Using a cox regression analysis, the risk of \nexperiencing progressive disease or death was reduced by 61% with MabThera maintenance treatment \nwhen compared to observation (95% CI; 45%-72%). Kaplan-Meier estimated progression-free rates at \n12 months were 78% in the MabThera maintenance group vs. 57 % in the observation group. An \nanalysis of overall survival confirmed the significant benefit of MabThera maintenance over \nobservation (p=0.0039 log-rank test). MabThera maintenance treatment reduced the risk of death by \n56% (95% CI; 22%-75%).  \n \nTable 11 Maintenance phase: overview of efficacy results MabThera vs. observation (28 \n\nmonths median observation time)  \nEfficacy Parameter Kaplan-Meier Estimate of  \n\nMedian Time to Event (Months) \nRisk \n\nReduction \nObservation \n\n(N = 167) \nMabThera \n\n(N=167) \nLog-Rank  \n\np value \nProgression-free survival (PFS) 14.3 42.2 < 0.0001 61 % \n\nOverall survival  NR NR 0.0039 56 % \n\nTime to new lymphoma \ntreatment \n\n20.1 38.8 < 0.0001 50 % \n\nDisease-free survivala 16.5 53.7 0.0003 67 % \nSubgroup analysis     \nPFS \n\nCHOP \nR-CHOP \n\nCR \nPR \n\n \nOS \n\nCHOP \nR-CHOP \n\n \n\n \n11.6 \n22.1 \n14.3 \n14.3 \n\n \n \n\nNR \nNR \n\n \n37.5 \n51.9 \n52.8 \n37.8 \n\n \n \n\nNR \nNR \n\n \n< 0.0001 \n0.0071 \n 0.0008 \n\n< 0.0001 \n \n \n\n0.0348 \n0.0482 \n\n \n71 % \n46 % \n64 % \n54 % \n\n \n \n\n55 % \n56 % \n\nNR: not reached; a: only applicable to patients achieving a CR \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nThe benefit of MabThera maintenance treatment was confirmed in all subgroups analysed, regardless \nof induction regimen (CHOP or R-CHOP) or quality of response to induction treatment (CR or PR) \n(Table 11). MabThera maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients \nresponding to CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p< 0.0001) as well \nas in those responding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, p=0.0071). \nAlthough subgroups were small, MabThera maintenance treatment provided a significant benefit in \nterms of overall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to R-CHOP, \nalthough longer follow-up is required to confirm this observation.  \n \nAdult Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 \nyears) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide \n750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and \nprednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or MabThera 375 mg/m2 plus \nCHOP (R-CHOP). MabThera was administered on the first day of the treatment cycle.  \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced \nin baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-CHOP \ntreatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the \nduration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse or \nprogression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p=0.0001). Kaplan Meier \nestimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm compared \nto 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41%. At 24 months, estimates for \noverall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4% in the CHOP arm. A subsequent \nanalysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up duration of 60 months, \nconfirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), representing a risk reduction of \n32%. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group and 62.4% in the CHOP group \n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by 51%. \nIn all patient subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, \nLDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk \nratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than \n0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and \nlow-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings  \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for anti-drug antibody (ADA), 1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m2, \ncyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or MabThera in combination with \nFC (R-FC). MabThera was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first cycle one day prior \nto chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle. Patients \nwere excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had previously been treated with \nmonoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to achieve a partial remission for \nat least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total of 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 \nFC) for the first-line study (Table 12a and Table 12b) and 552 patients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the \nrelapsed/refractory study (Table 13) were analysed for efficacy. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 months \nin the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of overall \nsurvival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = 0.0319, \nlog-rank test) (Table 12a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most patient \nsubgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 12b). \n \nTable 12a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for MabThera plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy Parameter Kaplan-Meier Estimate of  \nMedian Time to Event (Months) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nFC \n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n(N=408) \n\nLog-Rank  \np value \n\nProgression-free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \nOverall survival  NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) 72.6% 85.8% <0.0001 n.a. \n\nCR rates 16.9% 36.0% <0.0001  n.a. \nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

These studies support the use of MabThera with any chemotherapy. \nData in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with MabThera have demonstrated clinical benefit \n(including CR) and are supportive for MabThera re-treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA multicenter, open-label, randomized study of Lymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy \n(corticosteroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin, \netoposide and triple drug  [methotrexate/cytarabine/ corticosteroid] intrathecal therapy) alone or in \ncombination with MabThera was conducted in paediatric patients with previously untreated advanced \nstage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. Advanced stage is defined as Stage III with elevated \nLDH level (“B-high”), [LDH > twice the institutional upper limit of the adult normal values (> Nx2)] \nor any stage IV or BAL. Patients were randomized to receive either LMB chemotherapy or six IV \ninfusions of MabThera at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA in combination with LMB chemotherapy (two \nduring each of the two induction courses and one during each of the two consolidation courses) as per \nthe LMB scheme. A total of 328 randomized patients were included in the efficacy analyses, of which \none patient under 3 years of age received MabThera in combination with LMB chemotherapy. \n \nThe two treatment arms, LMB (LMB chemotherapy) and R-LMB (LMB chemotherapy with \nMabThera), were well balanced with regards to baseline characteristics.  Patients had a median age of \n7 and 8 years in the LMB arm and R-LMB arm, respectively.  Approximately half of patients were in \nGroup B (50.6% in the LMB arm and 49.4% in the R-LMB arm), 39.6% in Group C1 in both arms, \nand 9.8% and 11.0% were in Group C3 in the LMB and R-LMB arms, respectively.  Based on Murphy \nstaging, most patients were either BL stage III (45.7% in the LMB arm and 43.3% in the R-LMB arm) \nor BAL, CNS negative (21.3% in the LMB arm and 24.4% in the R-LMB arm). Less than half of the \npatients (45.1% in both arms) had bone marrow involvement, and most patients (72.6% in the LMB \narm and 73.2% in the R-LMB arm) had no CNS involvement. The primary efficacy endpoint was \n\n\n\n41 \n\nEFS, where an event was defined as occurrence of progressive disease, relapse, second malignancy, \ndeath from any cause, or non-response as evidenced by detection of viable cells in residue after the \nsecond CYVE course, whichever occurs first. The secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and CR \n(complete remission).  \n \nAt the pre-specified interim analysis with approximately 1 year of median follow-up, clinically \nrelevant improvement in the primary endpoint of EFS was observed, with 1-year rate estimates of \n94.2% (95% CI, 88.5% - 97.2%) in the R-LMB arm vs. 81.5% (95% CI, 73.0% - 87.8%) in the LMB \narm, and adjusted Cox HR 0.33 (95% CI, 0.14 – 0.79). Upon IDMC (independent data monitoring \ncommittee) recommendation based on this result, the randomization was halted and patients in the \nLMB arm were allowed to cross over to receive MabThera.   \n \nPrimary efficacy analyses were performed in 328 randomized patients with a median follow-up of 3.1 \nyears. The results are described in Table 14. \n \nTable 14: Overview of Primary Efficacy Results (ITT population) \n\nAnalysis LMB \n(N = 164) \n\nR-LMB \n(N=164) \n\nEFS 28 events 10 events \n\nOne-sided log-rank test p-value 0.0006 \n\nAdjusted Cox HR 0.32 (90% CI: 0.17, 0.58) \n\n3-year EFS rates 82.3% \n(95% CI: 75.7%, 87.5%) \n\n93.9% \n(95% CI: 89.1%, 96.7%) \n\nOS 20 deaths 8 deaths \n\nOne-sided log-rank test p-value 0.0061 \n\nAdjusted Cox model HR 0.36 (95% CI: 0.16; 0.81) \n\n3-year OS rates 87.3% \n(95% CI: 81.2%, 91.6%) \n\n95.1% \n(95% CI: 90.5%, 97.5%) \n\nCR rate 93.6% (95% CI: 88.2%; 97.0%)  94.0% (95% CI: 88.8%, 97.2%)  \n\n \nThe primary efficacy analysis showed an EFS benefit of MabThera addition to LMB chemotherapy \nover LMB chemotherapy alone, with an EFS HR 0.32 (90% CI 0.17 - 0.58) from a Cox regression \nanalysis adjusting for national group, histology, and therapeutic group. While no major differences in \nnumbers of patients achieving CR was observed between the two treatment groups, the benefit of \nMabThera addition to LMB chemotherapy was also shown in the secondary endpoint of OS, with the \nOS HR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.16 – 0.81). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMabThera in all subsets of the paediatric population with follicular lymphoma and CLL, and in the \npaediatric population from birth to < 6 months of age in CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  \nSee Section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe efficacy and safety of MabThera in alleviating the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis in \npatients with an inadequate response to TNF-inhibitors was demonstrated in a pivotal randomised, \ncontrolled, double-blind, multicenter trial (Trial 1).  \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTrial 1 evaluated 517 patients that had experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to one or \nmore TNF inhibitor therapies. Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed according to \nthe criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). MabThera was administered as two IV \ninfusions separated by an interval of 15 days. Patients received 2 x 1000 mg intravenous infusions of \nMabThera or placebo in combination with MTX. All patients received concomitant 60 mg oral \nprednisone on days 2-7 and 30 mg on days 8-14 following the first infusion. The primary endpoint was \nthe proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Patients were followed \nbeyond week 24 for long term endpoints, including radiographic assessment at 56 weeks and at 104 \nweeks. During this time, 81% of patients, from the original placebo group received MabThera between \nweeks 24 and 56, under an open label extension study protocol.  \n \nTrials of MabThera in patients with early arthritis (patients without prior methotrexate treatment and \npatients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, but not yet treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors) \nhave met their primary endpoints.  MabThera is not indicated for these patients, since the safety data \nabout long-term MabThera treatment are insufficient, in particular concerning the risk of development \nof malignancies and PML. \n \nDisease activity outcomes \nMabThera in combination with methotrexate significantly increased the proportion of patients \nachieving at least a 20 % improvement in ACR score compared with patients treated with \nmethotrexate alone (Table 15). Across all development studies the treatment benefit was similar in \npatients independent of age, gender, body surface area, race, number of prior treatments or disease \nstatus.  \n \nClinically and statistically significant improvement was also noted on all individual components of the \nACR response (tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessment, disability \nindex scores (HAQ), pain assessment and C-Reactive Proteins (mg/dL). \n \nTable 15 Clinical response outcomes at primary endpoint in Trial 1(ITT population)  \n\n Outcome† Placebo+MTX MabThera+MTX \n(2 x 1000 mg) \n\nTrial 1  \n \n\n N= 201 N= 298 \n \n\n ACR20 36 (18%) 153 (51%)*** \n ACR50 11 (5%) 80 (27%)*** \n ACR70 3 (1%) 37 (12%)*** \n EULAR Response \n\n(Good/Moderate) \n44 (22%) 193 (65%)*** \n\n Mean change in DAS -0.34 -1.83*** \n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo + MTX at the primary timepoint: ***p ≤ 0.0001 \n \nPatients treated with MabThera in combination with methotrexate had a significantly greater reduction \nin disease activity score (DAS28) than patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 15). Similarly, \na good to moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was achieved by \nsignificantly more MabThera treated patients treated with MabThera and methotrexate compared to \npatients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 15). \n \nRadiographic response \nStructural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Total \nSharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \n \nIn Trial 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor \ntherapies, receiving MabThera in combination with methotrexate demonstrated significantly less \nradiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at 56 weeks. Of the \npatients originally receiving methotrexate alone, 81 % received MabThera either as rescue between \n\n\n\n43 \n\nweeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A higher proportion of patients receiving the \noriginal MabThera/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression over 56 weeks (Table 16). \n \nTable 16 Radiographic outcomes at 1 year (mITT population) \n\n Placebo+MTX \n \n\nMabThera+MTX \n2 × 1000 mg \n\n \nTrial 1 (n = 184) (n = 273) \nMean change from baseline:   \n\nModified total sharp score 2.30 1.01* \n \n\nErosion score 1.32 0.60* \n \n\nJoint space narrowing score 0.98 0.41** \n \n\nProportion of patients with no radiographic \nchange \n\n46% 53%, NS \n\nProportion of patients with no erosive change  52% 60%, NS \n \n\n150 patients originally randomised to placebo + MTX in Trial 1 received at least one course of RTX + MTX by one year \n* p <0.05, ** p < 0.001.

Radiographic analysis \nat 2 years in Trial 1 demonstrated significantly reduced progression of structural joint damage in \npatients receiving MabThera in combination with methotrexate compared to methotrexate alone as \nwell as a significantly higher proportion of patients with no progression of joint damage over the 2-\nyear period. \n \nPhysical function and quality of life outcomes \nSignificant reductions in disability index (HAQ-DI) and fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scores were \nobserved in patients treated with MabThera compared to patients treated with methotrexate alone. The \nproportions of MabThera treated patients showing a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) \nin HAQ-DI (defined as an individual total score decrease of >0.22) was also higher than among \npatients receiving methotrexate alone (Table 17). \n \nSignificant improvement in health-related quality of life was also demonstrated with significant \nimprovement in both the physical health score (PHS) and mental health score (MHS) of the SF-36. \nFurther, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved MCIDs for these scores (Table 17). \n \nTable 17 Physical function and quality of life outcomes at week 24 in Trial 1 \n\nOutcome† Placebo+MTX MabThera+MTX \n(2 x 1000 mg) \n\n \n \nMean change in HAQ-DI \n\nn=201 \n \n\n0.1 \n\nn=298 \n \n\n-0.4*** \n% HAQ-DI MCID 20% 51% \nMean change in FACIT-T -0.5 -9.1*** \n \n \nMean Change in SF-36 PHS \n\nn=197 \n \n\n0.9 \n\nn=294 \n \n\n5.8*** \n% SF-36 PHS MCID 13% 48%*** \nMean change in SF-36 MHS 1.3 4.7** \n% SF-36 MHS MCID 20% 38%* \n\n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo at the primary time point: * p < 0.05, **p < 0.001 ***p ≤ 0.0001 \nMCID HAQ-DI ≥0.22, MCID SF-36 PHS >5.42, MCID SF-36 MHS >6.33 \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nEfficacy in autoantibody (RF and or anti-CCP) seropositive patients  \nPatients seropositive to Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti- Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP) \nwho were treated with MabThera in combination with methotrexate showed an enhanced response \ncompared to patients negative to both. \n \nEfficacy outcomes in MabThera treated patients were analysed based on autoantibody status prior to \ncommencing treatment. At Week 24, patients who were seropositive to RF and/or anti-CCP at baseline \nhad a significantly increased probability of achieving ACR20 and 50 responses compared to \nseronegative patients (p=0.0312 and p=0.0096) (Table 18). These findings were replicated at Week 48, \nwhere autoantibody seropositivity also significantly increased the probability of achieving ACR70. At \nweek 48 seropositive patients were 2-3 times more likely to achieve ACR responses compared to \nseronegative patients.

See Section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n \nAdult induction of remission \nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, a total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severe active GPA (75%) \nand MPA (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, randomised, double-blind, \nmulticenter, non-inferiority trial. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2 mg/kg/day) \nfor 3-6 months or MabThera (375 mg/m2) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy in during follow-up. Patients in \nboth arms received 1000 mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding \n80 mg/day).  Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of trial treatment.   \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. \nThe trial demonstrated non-inferiority of MabThera to cyclophosphamide for complete remission (CR) \nat 6 months (Table 19). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 20). \n \n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n1st\nCourse\n\n2nd\nCourse\n\n3rd\nCourse\n\n4th\nCourse\n\n%\n o\n\nf p\nat\n\nie\nnt\n\ns\n\nACR20\n\nACR50\n\nACR70\n\n\n\n46 \n\nTable 19 Percentage of adult patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n(Intent-to-treat population*)  \n\n MabThera  \n(n = 99) \n\nCyclophosphamide  \n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment Difference \n(MabThera- Cyclophosphamide) \n\n \n \nRate \n\n \n63.6% \n\n \n\n \n53.1% \n\n \n\n \n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n (−3.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n \n \n\n− CI = confidence interval. \n− * Worst case imputation \na Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound ( − 3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined \n\nnon-inferiority margin ( − 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \nTable 20  Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n\n MabThera Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI \n95%) \n\nAll patients n=99 n=98  \nNewly diagnosed n=48 n=48  \nRelapsing n=51 n=50  \nComplete remission  \nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (-3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% − 4.2% (− 23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\n  Worst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \nIn the MabThera group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved CR \nat 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for maintenance of \ncomplete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of patients achieved CR at \n18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the MabThera group compared \nwith four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 23/99 (23%) MabThera-treated patients from the induction of remission trial tested positive \nfor ADA by 18 months. None of the 99 MabThera-treated patients were ADA positive at screening.  \nThere was no apparent trend or negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy in the \ninduction of remission trial. \n \nAdult maintenance treatment  \nA total of 117 patients (88 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis) in disease remission were randomized to receive azathioprine (59 patients) or MabThera (58 \npatients) in a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open-label study.  Included patients were 21 to 75 \nyears of age and had newly diagnosed or relapsing disease in complete remission after combined \ntreatment with glucocorticoids and pulse cyclophosphamide. The majority of patients were ANCA-\npositive at diagnosis or during the course of their disease; had histologically confirmed necrotizing \nsmall-vessel vasculitis with a clinical phenotype of GPA or MPA, or renal limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis; or both. \n \nRemission-induction therapy included IV prednisone, administered as per the investigator’s discretion, \npreceded in some patients by methylprednisolone pulses, and pulse cyclophosphamide until remission \nwas attained after 4 to 6 months. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last \ncyclophosphamide pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either MabThera (two 500 mg IV \ninfusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by 500 mg IV every 6 months for 18 \n\n\n\n47 \n\nmonths) or azathioprine (administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then 1.5 mg/kg/day \nfor 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after these 22 months)). \nPrednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg per day) for at least \n18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop prednisone treatment \nafter month 18 were left at the investigator’s discretion.  \n \nAll patients were followed until month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last MabThera \ninfusion or azathioprine dose). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was required for all \npatients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 250 per cubic millimeter. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was the rate of major relapse at month 28.  \n \nResults \nAt month 28, major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of \nvasculitis activity ([BVAS] > 0) that could lead to organ failure or damage or could be life \nthreatening) occurred in 3 patients (5%) in the MabThera group and 17 patients (29%) in the \nazathioprine group (p=0.0007). Minor relapses (not life threatening and not involving major organ \ndamage) occurred in seven patients in the MabThera group (12%) and eight patients in the \nazathioprine group (14%).  \n \nThe cumulative incidence rate curves showed that time to first major relapse was longer in patients \nwith MabThera starting from month 2 and was maintained up to month 28 (Figure 3). \n \nFigure 3:  Cumulative incidence over time of first major relapse \n\n      \n \n \n\nNumber of Subjects with Major Relapse \nAzathioprine 0 0 3 3 5 5 8 8 9 9 9 10 13 15 17 \nRituximab 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 \nNumber of subjects at risk \nAzathioprine 59 56 52 50 47 47 44 44 42 41 40 39 36 34 0 \nRituximab 58 56 56 56 55 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 52 50 0 \n\nNote: Patients were censored at month 28 if they had no event.    \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 6/34 (18%) of MabThera treated patients from the maintenance therapy clinical trial \ndeveloped ADA.

The median age of \npatients in the study was: 14 years (range: 6-17 years) and the majority of patients (20/25 [80%]) were \nfemale.  A total of 19 patients (76%) had GPA and 6 patients (24%) had MPA at baseline.  Eighteen \npatients (72%) had newly diagnosed disease upon study entry (13 patients with GPA and 5 patients \nwith MPA) and 7 patients had relapsing disease (6 patients with GPA and 1 patient with MPA). \n \nThe study design consisted of an initial 6-month remission induction phase, with a minimum 18-\nmonth follow-up, up to a maximum of 54 months (4.5 years) overall.  Patients were to receive a \nminimum of 3 doses of IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 1 g/day) prior to the first \nMabThera IV infusion. If clinically indicated, additional daily doses (up to three), of IV \nmethylprednisolone could be given. The remission induction regimen consisted of four once weekly \nIV infusions of MabThera at a dose of 375 mg/m2 BSA, on study days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in combination \nwith oral prednisolone or prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day \nminimum (max 10 mg/day) by Month 6.  After the remission induction phase, patients could, at the \ndiscretion of the investigator, receive subsequent MabThera infusions on or after Month 6 to maintain \nPVAS remission and control disease activity (including progressive disease or flare) or to achieve first \nremission. \n \nAll 25 patients completed all four once weekly IV infusions for the 6-month remission induction \nphase.  A total of 24 out of 25 patients completed at least 18 months of follow-up.  \n \nThe objectives of this study were to evaluate safety, PK parameters, and efficacy of MabThera in \npaediatric GPA and MPA patients (≥ 2 to < 18 years old).  The efficacy objectives of the study were \nexploratory and principally assessed using the Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) (Table 21). \n \nCumulative Glucocorticoid dose (IV and Oral) by Month 6: \nTwenty-four out of 25 patients (96%) in Study WA25615 achieved oral glucocorticoid taper to 0.2 \nmg/kg/day (or less than or equal to 10 mg/day, whichever was lower) at or by Month 6 during the \nprotocol-defined oral steroid taper. \n \nA decrease in median overall oral glucocorticoid use was observed from Week 1 (median = 45 mg \nprednisone equivalent dose [IQR: 35 – 60]) to Month 6 (median = 7.5 mg [IQR: 4-10]), which was \nsubsequently maintained at Month 12 (median = 5 mg [IQR: 2-10]) and Mmonth 18 (median =5 mg \n[IQR: 1-5]).  \n \nFollow-Up Treatment \nDuring the Overall Study Period, patients received between 4 and 28 infusions of MabThera (up to 4.5 \nyrs [53.8 months]). Patients received up to 375 mg/m2 x 4 of MabThera, approximately every 6 \nmonths at the discretion of the investigator. In total, 17 out of 25 patients (68%) received additional \nrituximab treatment at or post Month 6 until the Common Close Out, 14 out of these 17 patients \nreceived additional rituximab treatment between Month 6 and Month 18. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nTable 21: Study WA25615 (PePRS) - PVAS Remission at Month 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18  \nStudy visit Number of Responders in PVAS Remission* \n\n(response rate [%]) \n\nn=25 \n\n95% CIα \n\n Month 1 0 0.0%, 13.7% \n\n Month 2 1 (4.0%) 0.1%, 20.4% \n\n Month 4 5 (20.0%) 6.8%, 40.7% \n\n Month 6 13 (52.0%) 31.3%, 72.2% \n\nMonth 12 18 (72.0%)  50.6%, 87.9% \n\nMonth 18 18 (72.0%)  50.6%, 87.9% \n\n* PVAS of 0 and achieved glucocorticoid taper to 0.2 mg/kg/day (or 10 mg/day, whichever is lower) at \ntheassessment time-point. \nαthe efficacy results are exploratory and no formal statistical testing was performed for these endpoints \nMabThera, treatment (375 mg/m2 x 4 infusions) up to Month 6 was identical for all patients.

Patients were between 19 and 79 years of age and had not received prior \ntherapies for pemphigus. In the PV population, 5 (13%) patients in the MabThera group and 3 (8%) \npatients in the standard prednisone group had moderate disease and 33 (87%) patients in the \nMabThera group and 33 (92%) patients in the standard-dose prednisone group had severe disease \naccording to disease severity defined by Harman’s criteria. \n \nPatients were stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) and randomised 1:1 to \nreceive either MabThera and low-dose prednisone or standard-dose prednisone.  Patients randomised \nto the MabThera group received an initial intravenous infusion of 1000 mg MabThera on Study Day 1 \nin combination with 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 3 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 6 months if they had severe disease, and a \nsecond intravenous infusion of 1000 mg on Study Day 15. Maintenance infusions of MabThera \n500 mg were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients randomised to the standard-dose prednisone \ngroup received an initial 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 12 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 18 months if they had severe disease.  \nPatients in the MabThera group who relapsed could receive an additional infusion of MabThera \n1000 mg in combination with reintroduced or escalated prednisone dose. Maintenance and relapse \ninfusions were administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion.  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \nThe primary objective for the study was complete remission (complete epithelialisation and absence of \nnew and/or established lesions) at month 24 without the use of prednisone therapy for two months or \nmore (CRoff for ≥2 months).  \n \nPV Study 1 Results \nThe study showed statistically significant results of MabThera and low-dose prednisone over standard-\ndose prednisone in achieving CRoff ≥ 2 months at month 24 in PV patients (see Table 22).   \n\nTable 22 Percentage of PV patients who achieved complete remission off corticosteroid \ntherapy for two months or more at month 24 (Intent-to-Treat Population - PV) \n\n Rituximab + \nPrednisone \n\nN=38 \n\nPrednisone \nN=36 \n\n \np-value a 95% CIb \n\nNumber of responders      \n(response rate [%]) \n\n34 (89.5%) 10 (27.8%) <0.0001 61.7% (38.4, 76.5) \n\nap-value is from Fisher’s exact test with mid-p correction \nb 95% confidence interval is corrected Newcombe interval   \n\n \n\n \nThe number of rituximab plus low-dose prednisone patients off prednisone therapy or on minimal \ntherapy (prednisone dose of 10 mg or less per day) compared to standard-dose prednisone patients \nover the 24-month treatment period shows a steroid-sparing effect of MabThera (Figure 4).  \n \nFigure 4:  Number of patients who were off or on minimal corticosteroid (≤10mg/day) therapy \n\nover time \n\n \n\n \nPost-hoc retrospective laboratory evaluation \nA total of 19/34 (56%) patients with PV, who were treated with MabThera, tested positive for ADA \nantibodies by 18 months. The clinical relevance of ADA formation in MabThera-treated PV patients is \nunclear.  \n \nPV Study 2 (Study WA29330) \nIn a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, multicenter study, the efficacy and \nsafety of MabThera compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were evaluated in patients with \nmoderate-to-severe PV receiving 60-120 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent (1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day) at \nstudy entry and tapered to reach a dose of 60 or 80 mg/day by Day 1.  Patients had a confirmed \ndiagnosis of PV within the previous 24 months and evidence of moderate-to-severe disease (defined as \na total Pemphigus Disease Area Index, PDAI, activity score of ≥ 15).   \n\n\n\n51 \n\nOne hundred and thirty-five patients were randomized to treatment with MabThera 1000 mg \nadministered on Day 1, Day 15, Week 24 and Week 26 or oral MMF 2 g/day for 52 weeks in \ncombination with 60 or 80 mg oral prednisone with the aim of tapering to 0 mg/day prednisone by \nWeek 24.   \n \nThe primary efficacy objective for this study was to evaluate at week 52, the efficacy of MabThera \ncompared with MMF in achieving sustained complete remission defined as achieving healing of \nlesions with no new active lesions (i.e., PDAI activity score of 0) while on 0 mg/day prednisone or \nequivalent, and maintaining this response for at least 16 consecutive weeks, during the 52-week \ntreatment period.  \n \nPV Study 2 Results \nThe study demonstrated the superiority of MabThera over MMF in combination with a tapering course \nof oral corticosteroids in achieving CRoff corticosteroid ≥ 16 weeks at Week 52 in PV patients (Table \n23).The majority of patients in the mITT population were newly diagnosed (74%) and 26% of patients \nhad established disease (duration of illness ≥ 6 months and received prior treatment for PV).  \n \nTable 23  Percentage of PV Patients Who Achieved Sustained Complete Remission Off \n\nCorticosteroid Therapy for 16 Weeks or More at Week 52 (Modified Intent-to-Treat \nPopulation) \n\n MabThera \n(N=62) \n\nMMF \n(N=63) \n\nDifference (95% CI) p-value \n\nNumber of responders \n(response rate [%]) \n \n\nNewly diagnosed patients \n \n\nPatients with established \ndisease \n\n \n\n25 (40.3%) \n \n19 (39.6%)  \n \n6 (42.9%) \n\n6 (9.5%) \n \n4 (9.1%)  \n \n2 (10.5%) \n\n30.80% (14.70%, 45.15%) <0.0001 \n\nMMF = Mycophenolate mofetil.

There was no apparent negative impact of the presence \nof ADA on safety or efficacy in PV Study 2. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdult Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or multiple \ninfusions of MabThera as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied MabThera \ndoses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), \nspecific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and central compartment \nvolume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, respectively. The estimated \nmedian terminal elimination half-life of MabThera was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days). Baseline \nCD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions contributed to some of the variability \nin CL2 of MabThera in data from 161 patients given 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4 \nweekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. \nHowever, a large component of inter-individual variability remained for CL2 after correction for \nCD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP \ntherapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) contributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) \nand concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were relatively small. Age, gender and WHO \nperformance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of MabThera.  This analysis suggests that \ndose adjustment of MabThera with any of the tested covariates is not expected to result in a \nmeaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nMabThera, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to MabThera, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth infusion \nof 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of patients 3 – 6 \nmonths after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of MabThera at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion, \nspanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 µg/mL \n(range, 171 – 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of MabThera when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with MabThera alone. \n \nPaediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL  \n \nIn the clinical trial studying paediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL, the PK was studied in a subset of 35 \npatients aged 3 years and older. The PK was comparable between the two age groups (ε3 to <12 years \nvs. ε12 to <18 years). After two MabThera IV infusions of 375 mg/m2 in each of the two induction \ncycles (cycle 1 and 2) followed by one MabThera IV infusion of 375 mg/m2 in each of the \nconsolidation cycles (cycle 3 and 4) the maximum concentration was highest after the fourth infusion \n(cycle 2) with a geometric mean of 347 g/mL followed by lower geometric mean maximum \nconcentrations thereafter (Cycle 4: 247 g/mL). With this dose regimen, trough levels were sustained \n(geometric means: 41.8 µg/mL (pre-dose Cycle 2; after 1 cycle), 67.7 µg/mL (pre-dose Cycle 3, after \n2 cycles) and 58.5 µg/mL (pre-dose Cycle 4, after 3 cycles)). The median elimination half-life in \npaediatric patients aged 3 years and older was 26 days. \n \nThe PK characteristics of MabThera in paediatric patients with DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL were similar to \nwhat has been observed in adult NHL patients. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nNo PK data are available in the ≥ 6 months to < 3 years age group, however, population PK prediction \nsupports comparable systemic exposure (AUC, Ctrough) in this age group compared to ≥ 3 years \n(Table 24). Smaller baseline tumor size is related to higher exposure due to lower time dependent \nclearance, however, systemic exposures impacted by different tumor sizes remain in the range of \nexposure that was efficacious and had an acceptable safety profile. \n \nTable 24: Predicted PK Parameters following the Rituximab Dosing Regimen in Paediatric \nDLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL \n\nAge group ≥ 6 mo to < 3 years ≥ 3 to < 12 years ≥ 12 to < 18 years \n\nCtrough (µg/mL) 47.5 (0.01-179) 51.4 (0.00-182) 44.1 (0.00-149) \n\nAUC1-4 cycles \n(µg*day/mL) 13501 (278-31070) 11609 (135-31157) 11467 (110-27066) \n\nResults are presented as median (min – max); Ctrough is pre-dose Cycle 4. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nMabThera was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased to \n500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 – 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/m2 \ninfusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 – 62 days). \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of MabThera at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 l (range, 1.7 to \n7.51 L). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume \nof distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- related pharmacokinetic \ndifferences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No \npharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first \ninfusion ranged from 157 to 171 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 µg/mL for 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 µg/mL for the \n2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 µg/mL for the 2 × 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal \nelimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for \nthe 2 × 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to \nthe first infusion for both doses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion was \n170 to 175 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Cmax following \nsecond infusion, was 207 µg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 µg/mL for the 2 \nx 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, following the second \ncourse, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. \nPK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 x 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \nconcentration of 369 µg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n \nAdult Population \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 MabThera once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 L/day) \nand 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. Maximum concentration during the first 180 days \n(Cmax), minimum concentration at Day 180 (C180) and Cumulative area under the curve over 180 days \n(AUC180) were (median [range]) 372.6 (252.3-533.5) µg/mL, 2.1 (0-29.3) µg/mL and 10302 (3653-\n21874)µg/mL*days, respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in adult GPA and MPA patients \nappear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 25 children (6-17 years old) with GPA and MPA \nwho received 375 mg/m2 MabThera once weekly for four doses, the estimated median terminal \nelimination half-life was 22 days (range, 11 to 42 days). Rituximab mean clearance and volume of \ndistribution were 0.221 L/day (range, 0. 0996 to 0.381 L/day) and 2.27 L (range 1.43 to 3.17 L) \nrespectively. Maximum concentration during the first 180 days (Cmax), minimum concentration at Day \n180 (C180) and Cumulative area under the curve over 180  days (AUC180) were (median [range]) \n382.8 (270.6-513.6) µg/mL, 0.9 (0-17.7) µg/mL and 9787 (4838-20446) µg/mL*day, respectively.The \nPK parameters of rituximab in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA were similar to those in adults \nwith GPA or MPA, once taking into account the BSA effect on clearance and volume of distribution \nparameters. \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nThe PK parameters in adult PV patients receiving MabThera 1000 mg at Days 1, 15, 168, and 182 are \nsummarized in Table 25. \n \nTable 25 Population PK in adult PV patients from PV Study 2  \n\nParameter Infusion Cycle \n\n 1st cycle of 1000 mg \nDay 1 and Day 15 \n\nN=67 \n\n2nd cycle of 1000 mg \nDay 168 and Day 182 \n\nN=67 \n\nTerminal Half-life (days) \nMedian \n(Range) \n\n \n21.0 \n\n(9.3-36.2) \n\n \n26.5 \n\n(16.4-42.8) \nClearance (L/day) \n\nMean \n(Range) \n\n \n391 \n\n(159-1510) \n\n \n247 \n\n(128-454) \nCentral Volume of \n\nDistribution (L) \nMean \n\n(Range) \n\n \n3.52 \n\n(2.48-5.22) \n\n \n3.52 \n\n(2.48-5.22) \n\n \nFollowing the first two rituximab administrations (at day 1 and 15, corresponding to cycle 1), the PK \nparameters of rituximab in patients with PV were similar to those in patients with GPA/MPA and \npatients with RA.  Following the last two administrations (at day 168 and 182, corresponding to cycle \n2), rituximab clearance decreased while the central volume of distribution remained unchanged. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of \nB cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue.  \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus \ndue to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid \norgans of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied by a decrease \nin IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within \n6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab. \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \nfemales were observed.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains 120 mg of rituximab. \n \nEach vial contains 1400 mg/11.7 mL rituximab. \n \nRituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a \nglycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions and murine light-chain and \nheavy-chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster \novary) cell suspension culture and purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange, including \nspecific viral inactivation and removal procedures.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear to opalescent, colourless to yellowish liquid with pH of 5.2 – 5.8 and osmolality of 300 - 400 \nmOsmol/kg.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMabThera is indicated in adults for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL):  \n \nMabThera is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.  \n \nMabThera maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients \nresponding to induction therapy.  \n \nMabThera is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMabThera should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of MabThera. \n \nPremedication with glucocorticoids should be considered if MabThera is not given in combination \nwith glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy.  \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used for adult patients is a \nsubcutaneous injection at a fixed dose of 1400 mg irrespective of the patient’s body surface area.  \n \nBefore starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients must always receive beforehand, a full \ndose of MabThera by intravenous infusion, using MabThera intravenous formulation (see section 4.4). \n \nIf patients were not able to receive one full MabThera intravenous infusion dose prior to the switch, \nthey should continue the subsequent cycles with MabThera intravenous formulation until a full \nintravenous dose is successfully administered.  \nTherefore, the switch to MabThera subcutaneous formulation can only occur at the second or \nsubsequent cycles of treatment. \n \nIt is important to check the medicinal product labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation \n(intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) and strength is being given to the patient, as prescribed. \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be \ngiven via subcutaneous injection only. The 1400 mg strength is intended for subcutaneous use in non \nHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) only. \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: first cycle with \nMabThera intravenous formulation 375 mg/m2 body surface area, followed by subsequent cycles with \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation injected at a fixed dose of 1400 mg per cycle for up to 8cycles. \n \nMabThera should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after administration of the \nglucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n \nMaintenance therapy \n\n• Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used as a maintenance treatment for \npatients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is:  \n1400 mg once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years (12 administrations in total). \n \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used as a maintenance treatment for \npatients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: \n1400 mg once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years (8 administrations in total).  \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nMabThera should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dose is: first \ncycle, MabThera intravenous formulation: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, followed by subsequent \ncycles with MabThera subcutaneous formulation injected at a fixed dose of 1400 mg per cycle. In \ntotal: 8 cycles. \n \nMabThera is administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle after intravenous infusion of the \nglucocorticoid component of CHOP. \n \nSafety and efficacy of MabThera have not been established in combination with other chemotherapies \nin diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of MabThera are recommended. When MabThera is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied (see section 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of MabThera in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous injections: \nMabThera 1400 mg subcutaneous formulation should be administered as subcutaneous injection only, \nover approximately 5 minutes. The hypodermic injection needle must only be attached to the syringe \nimmediately prior to administration to avoid potential needle clogging. \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation should be injected subcutaneously into the abdominal wall and \nnever into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are moles or scars. \n \nNo data are available on performing the injection in other sites of the body, therefore injections should \nbe restricted to the abdominal wall. \n \nDuring the treatment course with MabThera subcutaneous formulation, other medicinal products for \nsubcutaneous administration should preferably be given at different sites. \n \nIf an injection is interrupted it can be resumed at the same site or another location may be used, if \nappropriate. \n \nIntravenous infusion administration:  \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of MabThera100 mg and 500 mg concentrate for \nsolution for infusion should be referred to for information on dosing instructions and method of \nadministration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, hyaluronidase or to any of the other \nexcipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nThe information provided in the section 4.4 pertains to the use of MabThera subcutaneous formulation \nin the approved indications Treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (strength 1400 mg) and Treatment \nof Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (strength 1600 mg). For information related to the other \nindications, please refer to the SmPC of MabThera intravenous formulation.  \n \nThe use of MabThera subcutaneous formulation as monotherapy in patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy \ncannot be recommended as the safety of the once weekly subcutaneous administration has not been \nestablished. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n \nUse of MabThera may be associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening \nneurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing \nmust be suspended until PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to \ndetermine if the symptoms are indicative of neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these \nsymptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. Consultation with a neurologist should be considered as \nclinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered.  \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of MabThera must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and \nsuspension of MabThera therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nInfusion/Administration-related reactions \n \nMabThera is associated with infusion/administration-related reactions, which may be related to release \nof cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically \nindistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumor lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. They are not specifically related to \nthe route of administration of MabThera and can be observed with both formulations. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of \nthe MabThera intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first MabThera intravenous infusion. They were characterized by pulmonary events and in \nsome cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, \nchills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphaetemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, \nvisible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating \n\n\n\n62 \n\nthe first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour \ninfiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. \nPatients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted \nimmediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial \nimprovement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely \nmonitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. \nFurther treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in \nrepeated severe cytokine release syndrome.  \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant cells, \nwho may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, should  be treated with \nextreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout the first infusion. \nConsideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first infusion in these \npatients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent cycles if the \nlymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of \nhypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should \nbe available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of MabThera. \nClinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine \nrelease syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less \nfrequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during MabThera administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to giving MabThera. \n \nInfusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nMabThera intravenous formulation (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by \nhypotension and bronchospasm in 10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually \nreversible with interruption of MabThera infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an \nantihistaminic, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if \nrequired. Please see cytokine release syndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAdministration related reactions have been observed in up to 50% of patients treated with MabThera \nsubcutaneous formulation in clinical trials. The reactions occurring within 24 hours of the \nsubcutaneous injection consisted primarily of erythema pruritus, rash and injections site reactions such \nas pain, swelling and redness and were generally of mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) and transient \nnature (see section 4.8). \n \nLocal cutaneous reactions were very common in patients receiving MabThera subcutaneous in clinical \ntrials.  Symptoms included pain, swelling, induration, haemorrhage, erythema, pruritus and rash (see \nsection 4.8). Some local cutaneous reactions occurred more than 24 hours after the MabThera \nsubcutaneous administration. The majority of local cutaneous reactions seen following administration \nof MabThera subcutaneous formulation was mild or moderate and resolved without any specific \ntreatment. \n \nBefore starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients must always receive beforehand, a full \ndose of MabThera by intravenous infusion, using MabThera intravenous formulation. The highest risk \nof experiencing an administration related reaction is generally observed at cycle one. Beginning the \n\n\n\n63 \n\ntherapy with MabThera intravenous infusion would allow a better handling of the administration \nreactions by slowing or stopping the intravenous infusion.  \n \nIf patients were not able to receive one full MabThera intravenous infusion dose prior to the switch, \nthey should continue the subsequent cycles with MabThera intravenous formulation until a full \nintravenous dose is successfully administered. Therefore, the switch to MabThera subcutaneous \nformulation can only occur at the second or subsequent cycles of treatment. \n \nAs with the intravenous formulation, MabThera subcutaneous formulation should be administered in \nan environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available and under the close \nsupervision of an experienced healthcare professional. Premedication consisting of an \nanalgesic/antipyretic and an antihistamine should always be administered before each dose of \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation. Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered. \n \nPatients should be observed for at least 15 minutes following MabThera subcutaneous \nadministration. A longer period may be appropriate in patients with an increased risk of \nhypersensitivity reactions. \n \nPatients should be instructed to contact their treating physician immediately if symptoms that are \nsuggestive of severe hypersensitivity or cytokine release syndrome occur at any time after medicinal \nproduct administration. \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with MabThera. Therefore patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \n \nAlthough MabThera is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L as \nclinical experience in this population is limited. The MabThera intravenous formulation has been used \nin 21 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a \npresumable reduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nMabThera therapy.  \n \nInfections \n \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with MabThera (see section 4.8). \nMabThera should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of MabThera in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to \nserious infection (see section 4.8).  \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving the MabThera intravenous \nformulation including fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these patients were also \nexposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all \npatients before initiation of treatment with MabThera. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status \nand HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local \nguidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before \n\n\n\n64 \n\nstart of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent \nhepatitis B reactivation.  \n \nVery rare cases of PML have been reported during post-marketing use of the MabThera intravenous \nformulation in NHL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination \nwith chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  \n \nImmunisation \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following MabThera therapy has not been studied \nfor NHL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients treated with \nMabThera may receive non-live vaccinations; however, with non-live vaccines response rates may be \nreduced. In a non-randomized study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who received the \nMabThera intravenous formulation as monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had \na lower rate of response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 69% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer).  \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titers against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella and varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with \nMabThera.  \n \nSkin reactions \n \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens - Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith suspected relationship to MabThera, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with MabThera.  \n \nCo-administration with MabThera did not appear to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nfludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of fludarabine and \ncyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of MabThera. \n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal \nantibodies. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential must employ effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months after treatment with \nMabThera. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \n \nB-cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to MabThera have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to MabThera during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3).For these reasons MabThera should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should \nnot breastfeed while treated with MabThera and for 12 months following MabThera treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab or recombinant human hyaluronidase \n(rHuPH20) on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of MabThera on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that MabThera \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe information provided in this section pertains to the use of MabThera in oncology.  \nFor information related to the autoimmune indications, please refer to the SmPC of MabThera \nintravenous formulation. \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nDuring the development programme, the safety profile of MabThera subcutaneous formulation was \ncomparable to that of the intravenous formulation with the exception of local cutaneous reactions.  \nLocal cutaneous reactions, including injection site reactions were very common in patients receiving \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation. In the phase 3 SABRINA trial (BO22334), local cutaneous \nreaction were reported in up to 20% of patients receiving subcutaneous MabThera. The most common \nlocal cutaneous reactions in the Mabthera subcutaneous arm were injection erythema (13%), injection \npain (7%) and injection site oedema (4%).Events seen following subcutaneous administration were \nmild or moderate, apart from one patient who reported a local cutaneous reaction of Grade 3 intensity \n(injection site rash) following the first MabThera subcutaneous administration (Cycle 2).  Local \ncutaneous reactions of any grade in the MabThera subcutaneous arm were most common during the \nfirst subcutaneous cycle (Cycle 2), followed by the second, and the incidence decreased with \nsubsequent injections. \n \nAdverse reactions reported in MabThera subcutaneous formulation usage \n \nThe risk of acute administration-related reactions associated with the subcutaneous formulation of \nMabThera was assessed in two open-label trials involving patients with follicular lymphoma during \ninduction and maintenance (SABRINA/BO22334) and during maintenance only \n(SparkThera/BP22333). InSABRINA, severe administration-related reactions (grade≥3) were reported \nin two patients (2%) following administration of MabThera subcutaneous formulation. These events \nwere Grade 3 injection site rash and dry mouth. InSparkThera, no severe administration-related \nreactions were reported. \n \nAdverse reactions reported in MabThera intravenous formulation usage \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nThe overall safety profile of MabThera in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith MabThera monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy.  \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving MabThera were \ninfusion-related reactions which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The \nincidence of infusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less \nthan 1 % after eight doses of MabThera. \n  \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55 % of patients \nduring clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50 % of patients during clinical trial in patients \nwith CLL. \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse reactions were: \n• Infusion-related reactions (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see \n\nsection 4.4. \n• Infections, see section 4.4. \n• Cardiovascular disorders, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.). \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with MabThera alone or in combination with chemotherapy are \nsummarised in Table 1. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common  (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon  (≥  1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be \nestimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 ADRs reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing surveillance in patients \n\nwith NHL and CLL disease treated with MabThera monotherapy/maintenance or in \ncombination with chemotherapy  \n\nMedDRA \nSystem \n\nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfections, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis  \n \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \ntract infection, \nfungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, \n+acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1  \n\n serious \nviral \ninfection2 \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocytop\nenia \n \n\nanaemia,  \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopen\nia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenopat\nhy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia3 \n\n\n\n67 \n\nMedDRA \nSystem \n\nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxi\ns \n\ntumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum sickness \n\ninfusion-related \nacute reversible \nthrombocytopen\nia 4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia\n, weight \ndecrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased LDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \npalsy5 \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \nsenses5 \n\nEye \ndisorders \n\n lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \ndisorder \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventricul\nar tachycardia,  \n+ventricular \ntachycardia,  \n+angina,  \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nsevere \ncardiac \ndisorders 4 \nand 6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension  \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominately \ncutaneous), \nleukocytoclasti\nc vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased \ncough, rhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung disorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung \ndisease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4, \n \n\nlung infiltration,  \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nnausea  vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestina\nl perforation7 \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nMedDRA \nSystem \n\nOrgan Class \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneou\ns tissue \ndisorders \n\npruritis, rash, \n+alopecia  \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \nskin reactions, \nStevens-Johns\non Syndrome, \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome) 7 \n\n \n\nMusculoskel\netal, \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders \nand \nadministrati\non site \nconditions \n\nfever , chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache  \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, cold \nsyndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering,  \n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nInvestigation\ns \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of \n\nMabThera therapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated \n\nwith infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were \nreported at a similar or lower incidence in the MabThera-arms compared to control arms: \nhaematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50 % of \npatients in clinical trials involving MabThera intravenous formulation, and were predominantly seen \nduring the first infusion, usually in the first one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised \nfever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, \nnausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, \nhypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. \nSevere infusion-related reactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12 % of the \ncases. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, \npulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac \nconditions such as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or \nunknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with \nsubsequent intravenous infusions and is <1% of patients by the eighth cycle of MabThera (containing) \ntreatment.  \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections  \nMabThera induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased \nserum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients.  \n \nLocalized candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the \nMabThera-containing arm of randomized studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of \npatients treated with MabThera monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including \ngrade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during MabThera maintenance treatment up to 2 years when \ncompared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a \n2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or \nexacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with MabThera treatment. The majority of \npatients had received MabThera in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem \ncell transplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses \n(Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (PML) and hepatitis C \nvirus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and retreatment have also been \nreported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, have been reported, the majority of which \nwere in patients receiving MabThera in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Progression of \nKaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in MabThera-exposed patients with pre-existing Kaposi’s \nsarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV \npositive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions  \nIn clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia \nwas reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During \nMabThera maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopoenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1 %, grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with MabThera in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopoenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%), neutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. \nCVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%), were usually reported with higher frequencies when \ncompared to chemotherapy alone. However, the higher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated \nwith MabThera and chemotherapy was not associated with a higher incidence of infections and \ninfestations compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. There were no differences reported \nfor the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the \nlast infusion of MabThera were reported.  \n \nIn studies of MabThera in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline \nlevel within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with MabThera and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischemia) in 3% of patients treated with MabThera compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating MabThera in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a MabThera \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \n\n\n\n70 \n\ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease.  \n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders  \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period.   \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognized \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nMabThera for treatment of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). In the majority of these cases, \nMabThera was administered with chemotherapy.  \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating MabThera maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the MabThera groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the MabThera group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the MabThera group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - MabThera monotherapy \nElderly (≥ 65 years):  \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to \nyounger patients (<65 years).  \n \nBulky disease: \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \nRe-treatment: \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of MabThera was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous MabThera formulation is \navailable from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of MabThera tested in humans \nto date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No additional \nsafety signals were identified. \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nThree patients in the MabThera subcutaneous formulation trial SABRINA (BO22334) were \ninadvertently administered subcutaneous formulation through the intravenous route up to a maximum \nrituximab dose of 2780 mg with no untoward effect.  \nPatients who experience overdose or medication error should be closely monitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of MabThera overdose have been reported. Three cases had no \nreported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a \ndose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C02 \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation contains recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an \nenzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-administered substances when \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95 % of all \nB cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.  \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalise upon \nantibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free \nantigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the \nsurface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD 20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of MabThera. In \npatients treated for hematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment \nand generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in \nsome patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction \ntherapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood was \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n72 \n\nobserved following two infusions of 1000 mg MabThera separated by a 14 day interval. Peripheral \nblood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation is observed in the \nmajority of patients by week 40, whether MabThera was administered as monotherapy or in \ncombination with methotrexate. \n \nClinical experience of MabThera subcutaneous formulation in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nThe clinical experience of MabThera subcutaneous formulation in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is based \non data from a phase III clinical trial (SABRINA BO22334) in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) \nand a phase Ib dose-finding/dose-confirmation trial (SparkThera BP22333) in patients with FL. \nResults from trial BP22333 are presented in section 5.2. \n \nTrial BO22334 (SABRINA) \nA two-stage phase III, international, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label trial was \nconducted in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, to investigate the non-inferiority \nof the pharmacokinetic profile, together with efficacy and safety of MabThera subcutaneous \nformulation in combination with CHOP or CVP versus MabThera intravenous formulation in \ncombination with CHOP or CVP.  \n \nThe objective of the first stage was to establish the rituximab subcutaneous dose that resulted in \ncomparable MabThera subcutaneous formulation serum Ctrough levels compared with MabThera \nintravenous formulation, when given as part of induction treatment every 3 weeks (see section 5.2). \nStage 1 enrolled previously untreated patients (n=127) CD20-positive, Follicular Lymphoma (FL) \nGrade 1, 2 or 3a. \n \nThe objective of stage 2 was to provide additional efficacy and safety data for subcutaneous rituximab \ncompared with rituximab intravenous using the 1400 mg subcutaneous dose established in stage 1.  \nPreviously untreated patients with CD20-positive, Follicular Lymphoma Grade 1, 2 or 3a (n=283) \nwere enrolled in the stage 2. \n \nThe overall trial design was identical among both stages and patients were randomized into the \nfollowing two treatment groups: \n \n• MabThera subcutaneous formulation (n= 205): first cycle MabThera intravenous formulation \n\nplus 7 cycles of MabThera subcutaneous formulation in combination with up to 8 cycles of \nCHOP or CVP chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. \nMabThera intravenous formulation was used at the standard dose of 375 mg/m2 body surface \narea. \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation was given at a fixed dose of 1400 mg. \nPatients achieving at least partial response (PR) were entered on the MabThera subcutaneous \n\n formulation maintenance therapy once every 8 weeks for 24 months. \n \n\n• MabThera intravenous formulation (n= 205): 8 cycles of MabThera intravenous formulation in \ncombination with up to 8 cycles of CHOP or CVP chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks.  \nMabThera intravenous formulation was used at the standard dose of 375 mg/m2. \nPatients achieving at least PR were entered on MabThera intravenous formulation maintenance \ntherapy once every 8 weeks for 24 months. \n\n \nKey efficacy results for the pooled analysis of 410 patients in SABRINA stages 1 and 2 are shown in \ntable 2. \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nTable 2 Efficacy results for SABRINA (BO22334) (Intent to Treat Population) \n Pooled Stages 1 & 2 \n\nN = 410 \n\nRituximab \nintravenous \nformulation \n\n(n = 205) \n\nRituximab \nsubcutaneous \nformulation \n\n(n = 205) \n\nORR a \nPoint estimate 84.9% (n = 174) 84.4% (n = 173) \n\n95% CI [79.2%, 89.5%] [78.7%, 89.1%] \n\nCRR \nPoint estimate 31.7% (n = 65) 32.2% (n = 66) \n\n95% CI [25.4%, 38.6%] [25.9%, 39.1%] \n\nPFSb \nProportion with PFS event 34.6% (n = 71 ) 31.7% ( n = 65) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.90 [0.64%, 1.26%] \n\nORR – Overall Response Rate \nCRR – Complete Response Rate \nPFS – Progression-Free Survival (proportion with event, disease progression/relapse or death from any cause) \na – at end of Induction \nb – at time of final analysis (median follow-up 58 months)  \n \nExploratory analyses showed response rates among BSA, chemotherapy and gender subgroups were \nnot notably different from the ITT population. \n \nImmunogenicity \nData from the development programme of MabThera subcutaneous formulation indicate that the \nformation of anti-rituximab antibodies after subcutaneous administration is comparable with that \nobserved after intravenous administration. In the SABRINA trial (BO22334) the incidence of \ntreatment-induced/enhanced anti-rituximab antibodies was low and similar in the intravenous and \nsubcutaneous groups (1.9% vs. 2%, respectively).  The incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced \nanti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 8% in the intravenous group compared with 15% in the subcutaneous \ngroup, and none of the patients who tested positive for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies tested positive for \nneutralizing antibodies.   \n \nThe overall proportion of patients found to have anti-rHuPH20 antibodies remained generally constant \nover the follow-up period in both cohorts. The clinical relevance of the development of anti-rituximab \nantibodies or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies after treatment with MabThera subcutaneous formulation is not \nknown. \nThere was no apparent impact of the presence of anti-rituximab or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on safety \nor efficacy. \n \nClinical experience of MabThera concentrate for solution for infusion in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nInitial treatment in combination with chemotherapy \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days \n1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or MabThera 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). \nMabThera was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 \nR-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of patients \nwas 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, time to \ntreatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of patients with \na tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< 0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP \ngroup (80.9 %) than the CVP group (57.2 %). Treatment with R-CVP significantly prolonged the time \nto disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively (p \n< 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and \nwas 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test).  \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by center): survival rates at 53 months were \n80.9 % for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1 % for patients in the CVP group. \n \nResults from three other randomized trials using MabThera in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1078 patients responded \nto induction therapy, of which 1018 were randomized to MabThera maintenance therapy (n=505) or \nobservation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to baseline \ncharacteristics and disease status. MabThera maintenance treatment consisted of a single infusion of \nMabThera at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease progression or for a \nmaximum period of two years.  \n \nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months from \nrandomization, maintenance therapy with MabThera resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically \nsignificant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-free survival \n(PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (Table 4).  \n \nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with MabThera was also seen for the secondary \nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 4).  \n \nData from extended follow-up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the long-\nterm benefit of MabThera maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT and TNCT (Table 4). \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nTable 4 Overview of efficacy results for MabThera maintenance vs. observation at the \nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis \n(median FU: 25 months) \n\nFinal analysis \n(median FU: 9.0 years) \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nMabThera \nN=505 \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nMabThera \nN=505 \n\nPrimary efficacy     \nProgression-free survival (median) NR NR 4.06 years 10.49 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n50% \n\n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n39% \n\nSecondary efficacy     \nOverall survival (median) NR NR NR NR \nlog-rank p value 0.7246 0.7948 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n11% \n\n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n-6% \n\nEvent-free survival (median) 38 months NR 4.04 years 9.25 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n46% \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n36% \n\nTNLT (median) NR NR 6.11 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0003 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n39% \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n34% \n\nTNCT (median) NR NR 9.32 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0011 0.0004 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n40% \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n39% \n\nOverall response rate* 55% 74% 61% 79% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.33 (1.73, 3.15) 2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate* 48% 67% 53% 67% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.21 (1.65, 2.94) 2.34 (1.80, 3.03)  \n\n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.  \nFU: follow-up; NR: not reached at time of clinical cut off, TNCT: time to next chemotherapy treatment; TNLT: time to next \nanti lymphoma treatment. \n \nMabThera maintenance treatment provided consistent benefit in all predefined subgroups tested: \ngender (male, female), age (< 60 years, >= 60 years), FLIPI score (<=1, 2 or >= 3), induction therapy \n(R-CHOP, R-CVP or R-FCM) and regardless of the quality of response to induction treatment \n(CR/CRu or PR).

The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to baseline \ncharacteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial remission \nfollowing induction therapy were randomised in a second step to MabThera maintenance therapy \n(n=167) or observation (n=167).

MabThera maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients responding \nto CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p< 0.0001) as well as in those \nresponding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, p=0.0071). Although \nsubgroups were small, MabThera maintenance treatment provided a significant benefit in terms of \noverall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to R-CHOP, although \nlonger follow-up is required to confirm this observation.  \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 \nyears) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide \n750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and \nprednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or MabThera 375 mg/m2 plus \nCHOP (R-CHOP). MabThera was administered on the first day of the treatment cycle.  \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced \nin baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-CHOP \ntreatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the \nduration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse or \nprogression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p = 0.0001). Kaplan \nMeier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm \ncompared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41 %. At 24 months, \nestimates for overall survival were 68.2 % in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4 % in the CHOP arm. \nA subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up duration \n\n\n\n79 \n\nof 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), representing a risk \nreduction of 32 %. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2 % in the R-CHOP group and 62.4 % in the CHOP group \n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46 % and the risk of relapse by 51 %. \nIn all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, \nLDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk \nratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than \n0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and \nlow-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings  \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for HAMA, no responses were noted. Of 356 patients evaluated for ADA, \n1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with follicular lymphoma. See Section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRituximab pharmacokinetics following single dose administration of MabThera subcutaneous \n375 mg/m2, 625 mg/ m2 and 800 mg/ m2 were compared with MabThera intravenous 375 mg/ m2 in \nFL patients. Following subcutaneous administration, the absorption of rituximab is slow, reaching \nmaximal concentrations about 3 days after administration. Based on popPK analysis an absolute \nbioavailability of 71% was estimated. Rituximab exposure increased dose proportional over the \n375 mg/m2 to 800 mg/m2 subcutaneous dose range. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, \ndistribution volume, and elimination half-life were comparable for both formulations. \n \nTrial BP22333 (SparkThera) \nA two-stage phase Ib trial to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of MabThera \nsubcutaneous formulation in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) as part of maintenance treatment. \nIn stage 2, MabThera subcutaneous formulation at a fixed dose of 1400 mg was administered as \nsubcutaneous injection during maintenance treatment, after at least one cycle of MabThera intravenous \nformulation to FL patients who had previously responded to MabThera intravenous formulation in \ninduction. \n \nThe comparison of predicted median Cmax data for MabThera subcutaneous formulation and \nintravenous formulation are summarized in Table 7.   \n \nTable 7:  Trial BP22333 (SparkThera): Absorption - Pharmacokinetic parameters of MabThera \nSC compared to MabThera IV \n\n MabThera \nsubcutaneous \n\nMabThera \nintravenous \n\nPredicted median Cmax \n(q2m) µg/mL \n\n201 209 \n\nPredicted median Cmax \n(q3m) µg/mL \n\n189  184 \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nThe median Tmax in the MabThera subcutaneous formulation was approximately 3 days as compared to \nthe Tmax occuring at or close to the end of the infusion for the intravenous formulation. \n \nTrial BO22334 (SABRINA) \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation at a fixed dose of 1400 mg was administered for 6 cycles \nsubcutaneously during induction at 3-weekly intervals, following the first cycle of MabThera \nintravenous formulation, in previously untreated FL patients in combination with chemotherapy. The \nserum rituximab Cmax at cycle 7 was similar between the two treatment arms, with geometric mean \n(CV%) values of 250.63 (19.01) μg/mL and 236.82 (29.41) μg/mL for the intravenous and the \nsubcutaneous formulations respectively, with the resulting geometric mean ratio (Cmax, SC/Cmax, IV) of \n0.941 (90% CI: 0.872, 1.015).  \n \nDistribution/Elimination \n \nGeometric mean Ctrough and geometric mean AUCτ from the BP22333 and BO22334 trials are \nsummarized in Table 8. \n \nTable 8: Distribution/Elimination - Pharmacokinetic parameters of MabThera subcutaneous \ncompared to MabThera intravenous \n\nTrial BP22333 (SparkThera) \n Geometric \n\nmean Ctrough \n(q2m) µg/mL  \n\nGeometric \nmean Ctrough \n(q3m) µg/mL \n\nGeometric \nmean AUCτ \ncycle 2 (q2m) \n\nµg.day/mL \n\nGeometric \nmean AUCτ \ncycle 2 (q3m) \n\nµg.day/mL \nMabThera \nsubcutaneous \nformulation \n\n32.2 12.1 5430 5320 \n\nMabThera \nintravenous \nformulation \n\n25.9  10.9  4012 3947 \n\nTrial BO22334 (SABRINA) \n Geometric mean \n\nCtrough values at pre-dose cycle 8 \nµg/mL \n\nGeometric mean \nAUC values at cycle 7 \nµg.day/mL \n\nMabThera \nsubcutaneous \nformulation \n\n134.6  3778  \n\nMabThera \nintravenous \nformulation \n\n83.1  2734  \n\n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 403 follicular lymphoma patients who received \nsubcutaneous and/or intravenous MabThera, single or multiple infusions of MabThera as a single \nagent or in combination with chemotherapy, the population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), \ninitial specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and central \ncompartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.194 L/day, 0.535 L/day, and 4.37 L/day, respectively. \nThe estimated median terminal elimination half-life of MabThera subcutaneous formulation was \n29.7 days (range, 9.9 to 91.2 days).The analysis data set contained 6003 quantifiable samples from 403 \npatients administered SC and/or IV rituximab in trials BP22333 (3736 samples from 277 patients) and \nBO22334 (2267 samples from126 patients). Twenty nine (0.48%) post-dose observations (all from \ntrial BP22333) were below the quantification limit. There were no missing covariate values except \nbaseline B-cell count. Baseline tumour load was available only in trial BO22334. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nIn clinical trial BO22334, an effect was observed between body size and exposure ratios reported in \ncycle 7, between rituximab subcutaneous formulation 1400 mg q3w and rituximab intravenous \nformulation 375 mg/m2 q3w with Ctrough ratios of 2.29, 1.31, and 1.41 in patients with low, medium \nand high BSA, respectively (low BSA ≤ 1.70 m2; 1.70 m2 < medium BSA < 1.90 m2; high BSA \n≥ 1.90 m2). The corresponding AUCτ ratios were 1.66, 1.17 and 1.32. \n \nThere was no evidence of clinically relevant dependencies of rituximab pharmacokinetics on age and \nsex. \n \nAnti-rituximab antibodies were detected in only 13 patients and did not result in any clinically relevant \nincrease in steady-state clearance. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of \nB cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue.  \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus \ndue to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid \norgans of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied by a decrease \nin IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within \n6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunization. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab or rHuPH20 on fertility have not been \nperformed. In general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive \norgans in males or females were observed. Additionally, no effects on semen quality were shown for \nrHuPH20. \n \nIn embryofetal developmental studies in mice, rHuPH20 caused reduced fetal weight and loss of \nimplantations at systemic exposures sufficiently in excess of human therapeutic exposure. \nThere is no evidence of dysmorphogenesis (i.e. teratogenesis) resulting from systemic exposure to \nrHuPH20. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear to opalescent, colourless to yellowish liquid with pH of 5.2 – 5.8 and osmolality of 300 - 400 \nmOsmol/kg.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMabThera is indicated in adults in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with \npreviously untreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Only limited data \nare available on efficacy and safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies \nincluding MabThera or patients refractory to previous MabThera plus chemotherapy. \n \nSee section 5.1 for further information.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMabThera should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of MabThera. \n \nPremedication with glucocorticoids should be considered if MabThera is not given in combination \nwith glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy-.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used for adult patients is a \nsubcutaneous injection at a fixed dose of 1600 mg irrespective of the patient’s body surface area.  \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nBefore starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients must always receive beforehand, a full \ndose of MabThera by intravenous infusion, using MabThera intravenous formulation (see section 4.4). \n \nIf patients were not able to receive one full MabThera intravenous infusion dose prior to the switch, \nthey should continue the subsequent cycles with MabThera intravenous formulation until a full \nintravenous dose is successfully administered.  \nTherefore, the switch to MabThera subcutaneous formulation can only occur at the second or \nsubsequent cycles of treatment. \n \nIt is important to check the medicinal product labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation \n(intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) and strength is being given to the patient, as prescribed. \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be \ngiven via subcutaneous injection only.   The 1600 mg strength is intended for subcutaneous use in \nCLL only. \n \nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start \nof therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL \npatients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before administration with MabThera to decrease \nthe rate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n \nThe recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \nand relapsed/refractory patients is: MabThera intravenous formulation 375 mg/m2 body surface area \nadministered on day 0 of the first cycle of treatment followed by MabThera subcutaneous formulation \ninjected at a fixed dose of 1600 mg per cycle, on day 1 of each subsequent cycle (in total: 6 cycles).  \nThe chemotherapy should be given after MabThera administration. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of MabThera are recommended. When MabThera is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied (see section 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of MabThera in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years).  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous injections \nMabThera 1600 mg subcutaneous formulation should be administered as subcutaneous injection only, \nover approximately 7 minutes. The hypodermic injection needle must only be attached to the syringe \nimmediately prior to administration to avoid potential needle clogging. \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation should be injected subcutaneously into the abdominal wall and \nnever into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or areas where there are moles or scars. \n \nNo data are available on performing the injection in other sites of the body, therefore injections should \nbe restricted to the abdominal wall. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nDuring the treatment course with MabThera subcutaneous formulation, other medicinal products for \nsubcutaneous administration should preferably be given at different sites. \n \nIf an injection is interrupted it can be resumed at the same site or another location may be used, if \nappropriate. \n \nIntravenous infusion administration  \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of MabThera 100 mg and 500 mg concentrate for \nsolution for infusion should be referred to for information on dosing instructions and method of \nadministration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, hyaluronidase or to any of the other \nexcipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTreacibility \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nThe information provided in the section 4.4 pertains to the use of MabThera subcutaneous formulation \nin the approved indications Treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (strength 1400 mg) and Treatment \nof CLL (strength 1600 mg). For information related to the other indications, please refer to the SmPC \nof MabThera intravenous formulation.  \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n \nUse of MabThera may be associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening \nneurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing \nmust be suspended until PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to \ndetermine if the symptoms are indicative of neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these \nsymptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. Consultation with a neurologist should be considered as \nclinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered.  \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of MabThera must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and \nsuspension of MabThera therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nInfusion/Administration-related reactions \n \nMabThera is associated with infusion/administration-related reactions, which may be related to release \nof cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically \nindistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumor lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. They are not specifically related to \nthe route of administration of MabThera and can be observed with both formulations. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of \nthe MabThera intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first MabThera intravenous infusion. They were characterized by pulmonary events and in \nsome cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, \nchills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphaetemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, \nvisible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating \nthe first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour \ninfiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. \nPatients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted \nimmediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial \nimprovement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely \nmonitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. \nFurther treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in \nrepeated severe cytokine release syndrome.  \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant cells, \nsuch as patients with CLL who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, \nshould be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout \nthe first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first \ninfusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent \ncycles if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of \nhypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should \nbe available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of MabThera. \nClinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine \nrelease syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less \nfrequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during MabThera administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to giving MabThera. \n \nInfusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nMabThera intravenous formulation (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by \nhypotension and bronchospasm in 10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually \n\n\n\n88 \n\nreversible with interruption of MabThera infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an \nantihistaminic, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if \nrequired. Please see cytokine release syndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAdministration related reactions have been observed in up to 50% of patients treated with MabThera \nsubcutaneous formulation in clinical trials. The reactions occurring within 24 hours of the \nsubcutaneous injection consisted primarily of erythema pruritus, rash and injections site reactions such \nas pain, swelling and redness and were generally of mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) and transient \nnature (see section 4.8). \n \nLocal cutaneous reactions were very common in patients receiving MabThera subcutaneous in clinical \ntrials. Symptoms included pain, swelling, induration, haemorrhage, erythema, pruritus and rash (see \nsection 4.8). Some local cutaneous reactions occurred more than 24 hours after the MabThera \nsubcutaneous administration. The majority of local cutaneous reactions seen following administration \nof MabThera subcutaneous formulation was mild or moderate and resolved without any specific \ntreatment. \n \nBefore starting MabThera subcutaneous injections, all patients must always receive beforehand, a full \ndose of MabThera by intravenous infusion, using MabThera intravenous formulation. The highest risk \nof experiencing an administration related reaction is generally observed at cycle one. Beginning the \ntherapy with MabThera intravenous infusion would allow a better handling of the administration \nreactions by slowing or stopping the intravenous infusion.  \n \nIf patients were not able to receive one full MabThera intravenous infusion dose prior to the switch, \nthey should continue the subsequent cycles with MabThera intravenous formulation until a full \nintravenous dose is successfully administered. Therefore, the switch to MabThera subcutaneous \nformulation can only occur at the second or subsequent cycles of treatment. \n \nAs with the intravenous formulation, MabThera subcutaneous formulation should be administered in \nan environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available and under the close \nsupervision of an experienced healthcare professional. Premedication consisting of an \nanalgesic/antipyretic and an antihistamine should always be administered before each dose of \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation. Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered. \n \nPatients should be observed for at least 15 minutes following MabThera subcutaneous \nadministration. A longer period may be appropriate in patients with an increased risk of \nhypersensitivity reactions. \n \nPatients should be instructed to contact their treating physician immediately if symptoms that are \nsuggestive of severe hypersensitivity or cytokine release syndrome occur at any time after medicinal \nproduct administration. \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with MabThera. Therefore patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \n \nAlthough MabThera is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L as \nclinical experience in this population is limited. The MabThera intravenous formulation has been used \nin 21 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a \npresumable reduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nMabThera therapy.  \n \nInfections \n \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with MabThera (see section 4.8). \nMabThera should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of MabThera in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to \nserious infection (see section 4.8).  \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving the MabThera intravenous \nformulation including fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these patients were also \nexposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL \npatients suggests that MabThera treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B \ninfections. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of \ntreatment with MabThera. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status.  These \ncan be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active \nhepatitis B disease should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology \n(either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.  \n \nVery rare cases of PML have been reported during post-marketing use of the MabThera intravenous \nformulation in CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination \nwith chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  \n \nImmunisation \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following MabThera therapy has not been studied \nfor NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients \ntreated with MabThera may receive non-live vaccinations; however, with non-live vaccines response \nrates may be reduced. In a non-randomized study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who received \nthe MabThera intravenous formulation as monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls \nhad a lower rate of response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole \nLimpet Haemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 69% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody \ntiter). For CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases, \nbut this has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titers against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella and varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with \nMabThera.  \n \nSkin reactions \n \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s Syndrome) and Stevens - Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith suspected relationship to MabThera, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with MabThera.  \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with MabThera did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of MabThera. \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal \nantibodies. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential must employ effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months after treatment with \nMabThera. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \n \nB-cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to MabThera have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to MabThera during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3).For these reasons MabThera should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should \nnot breastfeed while treated with MabThera and for 12 months following MabThera treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab or recombinant human hyaluronidase \n(rHuPH20) on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of MabThera on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that MabThera \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe information provided in this section pertains to the use of MabThera in oncology.  \nFor information related to the autoimmune indications, please refer to the SmPC of MabThera \nintravenous formulation. \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nDuring the development programme, the safety profile of MabThera subcutaneous formulation was \ncomparable to that of the intravenous formulation with the exception of local cutaneous reactions.  \nLocal cutaneous reactions including injection site reactions were very common in patients receiving \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation. In the NHL phase 3 trial SABRINA (BO22334), local cutaneous \nreactions were reported in up to 20% of patients receiving subcutaneous MabThera.  The most \ncommon local cutaneous reactions in the MabThera subcutaneous arm were injection site erythema \n(13%), injection site pain (7%), and injection site oedema (4%). Events seen following subcutaneous \nadministration were mild or moderate, apart from one patient who reported a local cutaneous reaction \n\n\n\n91 \n\nof Grade 3 intensity (injection site rash) following the first MabThera subcutaneous administration \n(Cycle 2).  Local cutaneous reactions of any grade in the MabThera subcutaneous arm were most \ncommon during the first subcutaneous cycle (Cycle 2), followed by the second, and the incidence \ndecreased with subsequent injections. Similar events were observed in the CLL SAWYER trial \n(BO25341) and were reported in up to 42% of patients in the MabThera subcutaneous arm. Most \ncommon local cutaneous reactions were injection site erythema (26%), injection site pain (16%), and \ninjection site swelling (5%).  Two patients in SAWYER trial who experienced Grade 3 local \ncutaneous reactions (injection site erythema, injection site pain and injection site swelling).  \n \nAdverse reactions reported in MabThera subcutaneous formulation usage \n \nThe risk of acute administration-related reactions associated with the subcutaneous formulation of \nMabThera was assessed in -three clinical trials: SparkThera and SABRINA (the two trials in NHL) \nand SAWYER the CLL trial.  \nIn trial SABRINA, severe administration-related reactions (grade≥3) were reported in two patients  \n(2%) following administration of MabThera subcutaneous formulation .  These events were Grade 3 \ninjection site rash and dry mouth.  \nIn trial SparkThera, no severe administration-related reactions were reported. \nIn SAWYER (BO25341), severe administration-related reactions (Grade ≥3) were reported in four \npatients (5%) following MabThera subcutaneous administration. These events were Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia and Grade 3 anxiety, injection-site erythema and urticaria. \n \nAdverse reactions reported in MabThera intravenous formulation usage \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nThe overall safety profile of MabThera in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith MabThera monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy.  \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving MabThera were \ninfusion-related reactions which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The \nincidence of infusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less \nthan 1 % after eight doses of MabThera. \n  \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55 % of patients \nduring clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50 % of patients during clinical trial in patients \nwith CLL. \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse reactions were: \n• Infusion-related reactions (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see \n\nsection 4.4. \n• Infections, see section 4.4. \n• Cardiovascular disorders, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.). \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with MabThera alone or in combination with chemotherapy are \nsummarised in Table 1. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common  (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon  (≥  1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be \nestimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 ADRs reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing surveillance in patients \n\nwith NHL and CLL disease treated with MabThera monotherapy/maintenance or in \ncombination with chemotherapy  \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfections, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis  \n \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory tract \ninfection, fungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, +acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1  \n\n serious viral \ninfection2 \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyt\nopenia \n \n\nanaemia,  \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopeni\na \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenop\nathy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate neutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\ninfusion-related \nacute reversible \nthrombocytopeni\na 4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia, \nweight decrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased LDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \npalsy5 \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \nsenses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear pain    hearing loss5 \n\n\n\n93 \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac disorder \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventric\nular \ntachycardia,  \n+ventricular \ntachycardia,  \n+angina,  \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nsevere cardiac \ndisorders 4 and \n6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension  \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominatel\ny cutaneous), \nleukocytoclas\ntic vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased cough, \nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung disorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4, \n \n\nlung infiltration,  \n\nGastrointestin\nal disorders \n\nnausea  vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestin\nal \nperforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\npruritis, \nrash, \n+alopecia  \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe \nbullous skin \nreactions, \nStevens-Johns\non Syndrome, \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nSyndrome) 7 \n\n \n\nMusculoskelet\nal, connective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nn site \nconditions \n\nfever , chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache  \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, cold \nsyndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering,  \n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\n\n\n94 \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInvestigations decreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked with \n\"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of MabThera \n\ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated with \n\ninfusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were \nreported at a similar or lower incidence in the MabThera-arms compared to control arms: \nhaematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50 % of \npatients in clinical trials involving MabThera intravenous formulation, and were predominantly seen \nduring the first infusion, usually in the first one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised \nfever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, \nnausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, \nhypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. \nSevere infusion-related reactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12 % of the \ncases. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, \npulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac \nconditions such as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or \nunknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with \nsubsequent intravenous infusions and is <1% of patients by the eighth cycle of MabThera (containing) \ntreatment.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections  \nMabThera induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased \nserum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients.  \n \nLocalized candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the \nMabThera-containing arm of randomized studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of \npatients treated with MabThera monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including \ngrade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during MabThera maintenance treatment up to 2 years when \ncompared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a \n2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or \nexacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with MabThera treatment. The majority of \npatients had received MabThera in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem \ncell transplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses \n(Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (PML) and hepatitis C \nvirus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and retreatment have also been \nreported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, have been reported, the majority of which \nwere in patients receiving MabThera in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with \nrelapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary \ninfection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% in FC. Progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in \n\n\n\n95 \n\nMabThera-exposed patients with pre-existing Kaposi’s sarcoma. These cases occurred in \nnon-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions  \nIn clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia \nwas reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During \nMabThera maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopoenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1 %, grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with MabThera in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopoenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \ngrade 3/4 neutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC \n19% in previously untreated CLL), grade 3/4 pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously \nuntreated CLL)  were usually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy \nalone. However, the higher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with MabThera and \nchemotherapy was not associated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to \npatients treated with chemotherapy alone. Studies with MabThera intravenous formulation in \npreviously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established that in up to 25% of patients treated \nwith R-FC  neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil count remaining below 1x109/L between \nday 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late onset (defined as neutrophil count below \n1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with no previous prolonged neutropenia or who \nrecovered prior to day 42) following treatment with MabThera plus FC.There were no differences \nreported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia occurring more than four weeks \nafter the last infusion of MabThera were reported. In the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients \nexperienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). \nIn the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in \nthe R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in the FC group.  \n \nIn studies of MabThera in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline \nlevel within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with MabThera monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with MabThera and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischemia) in 3% of patients treated with MabThera compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating MabThera in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a MabThera \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome have been reported. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nNeurologic disorders  \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period.  In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% FC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognized \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nMabThera for treatment of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). In the majority of these cases, \nMabThera was administered with chemotherapy.  \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating MabThera maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the MabThera groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the MabThera group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the MabThera group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - MabThera monotherapy \nElderly (≥ 65 years):  \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to \nyounger patients (<65 years).  \n \nBulky disease: \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \nRe-treatment: \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of MabThera was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n \nPatient subpopulations - MabThera combination therapy \nElderly (≥ 65 years)  \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (<65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL. \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous MabThera formulation is \navailable from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of MabThera tested in humans \nto date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No additional \nsafety signals were identified. \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nThree  patients in the MabThera subcutaneous NHL formulation trial SABRINA (BO22334) were \ninadvertently adminstered subcutaneous formulation  through the intravenous route up to a maximum \nrituximab dose of 2780 mg with no untoward effect.  \nPatients who experience overdose or medication error with MabThera should be closely monitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of MabThera overdose have been reported. Three cases had no \nreported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a \ndose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C02 \n \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation contains recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), an \nenzyme used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co-administered substances when \nadministered subcutaneously. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95 % of all \nB cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.  \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalise upon \nantibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free \nantigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the \nsurface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD 20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of MabThera. In \npatients treated for hematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment \nand generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in \nsome patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction \ntherapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood was \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n98 \n\nobserved following two infusions of 1000 mg MabThera separated by a 14 day interval. Peripheral \nblood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation is observed in the \nmajority of patients by week 40, whether MabThera was administered as monotherapy or in \ncombination with methotrexate. \n \nClinical experience of MabThera subcutaneous formulation in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nA two-part phase Ib, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial (SAWYER BO25341) \nwas conducted in patients with previously untreated CLL, to investigate the non-inferiority of the \npharmacokinetic profile, together with efficacy and safety of MabThera subcutaneous formulation in \ncombination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe objective of the Part 1 was to select a MabThera subcutaneous formulation dose that resulted in \ncomparable MabThera serum Ctrough levels compared with MabThera intravenous formulation. A total \nof 64 patients with CLL were enrolled at any point prior to cycle 5 during their treatment with \nMabThera intravenous formulation in combination with chemotherapy. The dose of 1600 mg of \nMabThera subcutaneous formulation was selected for the Part 2 of the study. \n \nThe objective of the Part 2 was to establish the non-inferiority in observed Ctrough levels between the \nselected MabThera subcutaneous dose and the reference MabThera intravenous dose. \nA total of 176 patients with CLL were randomized into the following two treatment groups: \n \n\n• MabThera subcutaneous (n= 88); 1st cycle of MabThera intravenous 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with chemotherapy plus subsequent cycles (2-6) of MabThera subcutaneous \n1600mg in combination with chemotherapy. \n\n \n• MabThera intravenous (n= 88); 1st cycle of MabThera intravenous 375 mg/m2 in combination \n\nwith chemotherapy followed by up to 5 cycles of MabThera intravenous 500 mg/m2 in \ncombination with chemotherapy. \n\nThe response rates for the analysis of 176 patients in SAWYER Part 2 are shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Efficacy results for SAWYER (BO25341) (Intent to Treat Population) \n\n Part 2 \nN = 176 \n\nRituximab \nintravenous \nformulation \n\n(n = 88) \n\nRituximab \nsubcutaneous \nformulation \n\n(n = 88) \n\nORRa \nPoint estimate  80.7% (n = 71) 85.2% (n = 75) \n\n95% CI [70.9%, 88.3%] [76.1%, 91.9%] \n\nCRRa \nPoint estimate  31.8% (n = 28) 27.3% (n = 24) \n\n95% CI [22.3%, 42.6%] [18.3%, 37.8%] \n\nPFSb \nProportion with PFS event 42.0% (n = 37) 34.1% (n = 30) \n\n95% CI 0.76 [0.47%, 1.23%] \n\nORR – Overall Response Rate \nCRR – Complete Response Rate \nPFS – Progression-Free Survival (proportion with event, disease progression/relapse or death from any cause) \na – at 3 month follow-up visit (Part 2) \nb – at time of final analysis (median follow-up 53 months)  \n \n\n\n\n99 \n\nOverall the results confirm that MabThera subcutaneous formulation 1600 mg has a comparable \nbenefit/risk profile to that of MabThera intravenous formulation 500 mg/m2. \n \nImmunogenicity \nData from the development programme of MabThera subcutaneous formulation indicate that the \nformation of anti-rituximab antibodies after subcutaneous administration is comparable with that \nobserved after intravenous administration. In SAWYER trial (BO25341) the incidence of \ntreatment-induced/enhanced anti-rituximab antibodies was similar in the two treatment arms; 15% \nintravenous vs. 12% subcutaneous.  The incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-rHuPH20 \nantibodies, only measured in patients in the subcutaneous arm was 12%. None of the patients who \ntested positive for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.  \n \nThe clinical relevance of the development of anti-rituximab or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies after \ntreatment with MabThera subcutaneous formulation is not known. There was no impact of the \npresence of anti-rituximab or anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on safety, efficacy or PK of MabThera. \n \nClinical experience of MabThera concentrate for solution for infusion in CLL \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m2, \ncyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or MabThera in combination with \nFC (R-FC). MabThera was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first cycle one day prior \nto chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle. Patients \nwere excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had previously been treated with \nmonoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to achieve a partial remission for \nat least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total of 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 \nFC) for the first-line study (Table 2a and Table 2b) and 552 patients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the \nrelapsed/refractory study (Table 3) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 months \nin the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of overall \nsurvival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = 0.0319, \nlog-rank test) (Table 2a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most patient \nsubgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 2b). \n \nTable 2a First--line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for MabThera plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy Parameter Kaplan-Meier Estimate of  \nMedian Time to Event (Months) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nFC \n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n(N=408) \n\nLog-Rank  \np value \n\nProgression---free survival \n(PFS) \n\n32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \n\nOverall survival  NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) 72.6% 85.8% <0.0001 n.a. \n\nCR rates 16.9% 36.0% <0.0001  n.a. \nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

These studies support the use of MabThera with any chemotherapy. \nData in approximately 180 patients pre--treated with MabThera have demonstrated clinical benefit \n(including CR) and are supportive for MabThera re--treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with CLL. See Section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMabThera at a fixed dose of 1600 mg was administered for 5 cycles subcutaneously at 4-weekly \nintervals, following the first cycle of MabThera intravenous formulation, in previously untreated CLL \npatients in combination with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC). The serum \nMabThera Cmax at Cycle 6 was lower in the subcutaneous arm than the intravenous, with geometric \nmean (CV%) values of 202 (36.1) μg/mL and 280 (24.6) μg/mL with the resulting geometric mean \nratio (Cmax, SC/Cmax, IV) of 0.719 (90% CI: 0.653, 0.792).  The geometric mean tmax in the MabThera \nsubcutaneous group was approximately 3 days as compared to the tmax occuring at or close to the end \nof the infusion for the MabThera intravenous group. The geometric mean Ctrough (CV%) values at \nCycle 5 (pre-dose Cycle 6) were higher among the MabThera subcutaneous group than the MabThera \nintravenous group; 97.5 µg/mL (42.6) versus 61.5 µg/mL (63.9) respectively with a resulting adjusted \ngeometric mean ratio [90% CI] of 1.53 [1.27-1.85]. Similarly, the geometric mean AUC (CV%) \nvalues at Cycle 6 were higher among the subcutaneous group than the intravenous group; 4088 \nµg•day/mL (34.2) versus 3630 µg•day/mL (32.8) respectively) with a resulting adjusted geometric \nmean ratio [90% CI] of 1.10 [0.98-1.24]. \nBased on popPK analysis of study BO25341 (SAWYER) an absolute bioavailability of 68.4% was \nestimated. \n \nDistribution/Elimination \n \nThe estimated half-life of Mabthera subcutaneous formulation of 1600 mg is 30 days, the estimated \nclearance is 0.22 L/day and the volume of distribution of the central compartment is 4.65 L. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAs typical for monoclonal antibodies, rituximab PK parameters depended on body size measures.  All \nclearance and volume parameters increased with BSA.  In addition, central volume was slightly (9%) \nlower in females compared to males.  Absorption parameters of subcutaneous  formulation, decreased \nwith increasing BMI.  Conditional simulations that summarized the impact of all body size \ndependencies on rituximab exposure demonstrated that, while fixed subcutaneous dosing leads to \nlarger differences in exposure (Ctrough and AUCτ) between subjects with low and high body sizes \ncompared to body-weight-adjusted intravenous dosing, it allows to maintain Ctrough and AUCτ values \nfor all body-size groups at the levels not lower than levels attained by intravenous dosing, thus \nachieving at least the same target saturation as for intravenousdosing.  For subjects weighing  > 90 kg, \nCtrough values were the same for the intravenous and subcutaneous regimens.  For subjects weighing \n60-90 kg and  < 60 kg, average Ctrough values following intravenous dosing were approximately 16% \nand 34% lower compared to the subcutaneous regimen, respectively.  Similarly, for subjects in the \nhigh BSA tritile, Ctrough values were the same for the intravenous and subcutaneous regimens.  For \nsubjects in the middle and low BSA tritiles, average Ctrough values following intravenous dosing were \napproximately 12% and 26% lower compared to the subcutaneous regimen. \n \nIn addition to dependence on body size, time-dependent clearance was higher in subjects with higher \nbaseline tumour size, which is consistent with target-mediated elimination.  Higher time-dependenet \nclearance in subjects with higher disease burden would lead to lower initial exposure and longer time \nneeded to achieve the same exposure as in subjects with lower burden of the disease. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of \nB cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue.  \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus \ndue to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid \norgans of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied by a decrease \nin IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within \n6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunization. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab or rHuPH20 on fertility have not been \nperformed. In general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive \norgans in males or females were observed. Additionally, no effects on semen quality were shown for \nrHuPH20. \n \nIn embryofetal developmental studies in mice, rHuPH20 caused reduced fetal weight and loss of \nimplantations at systemic exposures sufficiently in excess of human therapeutic exposure. \nThere is no evidence of dysmorphogenesis (i.e. teratogenesis) resulting from systemic exposure to \nrHuPH20. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What MabThera is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use MabThera \n3. How to use MabThera \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store MabThera \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MabThera is and what it is used for \n \nWhat MabThera is \nMabThera contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \n \nWhat MabThera is used for \nMabThera may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. Your \ndoctor may prescribe MabThera for the treatment of: \n \na) Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell \ncalled B-Lymphocytes. \nIn adults MabThera can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”.  \nIn adult patients where the treatment is working, MabThera may be used as a maintenance treatment \nfor 2 years after completing the initial treatment. \nIn children and adolescents, MabThera is given in combination with “chemotherapy”. \n \nb) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a \nparticular lymphocyte, the B cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph \nnodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone \nmarrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you \nmay have. MabThera in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually \nremoved from the body by biological processes. \n \nc) Rheumatoid arthritis \nMabThera is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of the \njoints. B lymphocytes are involved in the cause of some of the symptoms you have. MabThera is used \nto treat rheumatoid arthritis in people who have already tried some other medicines which have either \nstopped working, have not worked well enough or have caused side effects. MabThera is usually taken \ntogether with another medicine called methotrexate.  \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nMabThera slows down the damage to your joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis and improves your \nability to do normal daily activities. \n \nThe best responses to MabThera are seen in those who have a positive blood test to rheumatoid factor \n(RF) and/or anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP). Both tests are commonly positive in \nrheumatoid arthritis and aid in confirming the diagnosis. \n \nd) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nMabThera is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis) or microscopic \npolyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B \nlymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n \ne) Pemphigus vulgaris \nMabThera is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. \nPemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of \nthe mouth, nose, throat and genitals. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use MabThera \n \nDo not take MabThera if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment  \n• you have a weak immune system. \n• you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, \n\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. \n \nDo not have MabThera if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera if: \n \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nMabThera could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems.   \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nMabThera. \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or \npemphigus vulgaris also tell your doctor \n• if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby MabThera help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before \nyou are given MabThera. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections.  \n\n\n\n127 \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to \ntravel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as MabThera or in \nthe months after you receive MabThera. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive MabThera. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nMabThera can be used for the the treatment of children and adolescents, 6 months of age and older, \nwith non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, specifically CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), \nBurkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like \nlymphoma (BLL). \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \nunder 18 years of age.  \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nMabThera can be used for treatment of children and adolescents, 2 years of age and older, with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis) or microscopic \npolyangiitis. There is not much information about the use of MabThera in children and adolescents \nwith other diseases. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \nunder 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and MabThera \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause MabThera can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way MabThera works.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given MabThera. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given MabThera. \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because MabThera can cross the placenta and may affect your \nbaby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while \nusing MabThera. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with MabThera. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with MabThera. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with MabThera. This is because MabThera may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether MabThera has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \nMabThera contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 52.6 mg sodium (main component of the cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL \nvial and 263.2 mg in each 50 mL vial.  \nThis is equivalent to 2.6% (for 10ml vial) and 13.2% (for 50ml vial) of the recommended maximum \ndaily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n \n3. How MabThera is given \n \nHow it is given \nMabThera will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side \neffects.  \nYou will always be given MabThera as a drip (intra-venous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each MabThera administration \nBefore you are given MabThera, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \n\n• If you are having MabThera alone \nMabThera will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with \nMabThera are possible. \n\n• If you are having MabThera with chemotherapy \nMabThera will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n\n• If you respond well to treatment, you may be given MabThera as a maintenance treatment \nevery 2 or 3 months for two years. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you \nrespond to the medicine. \n\n• If you are less than 18 years of age, you will be given MabThera with chemotherapy.  You \nwill receive MabThera up to 6 times over a 3.5 – 5.5 month period. \n\n \nb) If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nWhen you are treated with MabThera in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive MabThera \ninfusions on day 0 cycle 1 then day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles in total. Each cycle has a duration of \n28 days. The chemotherapy should be given after the MabThera infusion. Your doctor will decide if \nyou should receive concomitant supportive therapy. \n \nc) If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. \nRepeated courses of treatment with MabThera are possible. Depending on the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease, your doctor will decide when you should receive more MabThera. This may be months \nfrom now. \n \nd) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nTreatment with MabThera uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will \nusually be given by injection before the start of MabThera treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth \nmay be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. \nIf you are 18 years of age and older and respond well to treatment, you may be given MabThera as a \nmaintenance treatment.  This will be administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks \napart, followed by 1 infusion every 6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you \nlonger with MabThera (up to 5 years), depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \ne) If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you \nrespond well to treatment, you may be given MabThera as a maintenance treatment.  This will be \nadministered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or \nyour doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less \nfrequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), \ntiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue \nor throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number \nof platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse. Tell the person \ngiving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of these symptoms, as the \ninfusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an \nantihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be \ncontinued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your doctor may decide \nto stop your MabThera treatment if these reactions are serious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including: \n \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with MabThera.  \nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are listed \nbelow under “Other side effects”. \n \nIf you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you \nhave been given by your doctor.

What you need to know before you are given MabThera  \n3. How MabThera is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store MabThera  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MabThera is and what it is used for \n \nWhat MabThera is \nMabThera contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \nMabThera is available as a medicine given as a drip (called MabThera 100 mg or MabThera 500 mg, \nconcentrate for solution for infusion) and as a medicine for injection under your skin (called \nMabThera 1400 mg or MabThera 1600 mg, solution for subcutaneous injection). \n \nWhat MabThera is used for \nMabThera 1400 mg is used to treat Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in adults. \n• This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white \n\nblood cell called B-Lymphocytes. \n \nMabThera 1400 mg can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”.  \n \nYou will always be given MabThera as a drip (intra-venous infusion) at the start of your treatment.  \n \nAfter this, you will be given MabThera as an injection under your skin. Your doctor will decide when \nto start MabThera injections. \n \nIn patients where the treatment is working, MabThera may be used as a maintenance treatment for 2 \nyears after completing the initial treatment. \n \n \n2 What you need to know before you are given MabThera \n \nDo not have MabThera if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you are allergic to hyaluronidase (an enzyme that helps to increase the absorption of injected \n\n active substance)  \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n• you have a weak immune system. \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \nDo not have MabThera if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera. \n  \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera if: \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nMabThera could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems.  \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nMabThera. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \nunder 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of MabThera in \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and MabThera  \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause MabThera can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way MabThera works.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given MabThera. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given MabThera \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because MabThera can cross the placenta and may affect your \nbaby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while \nusing MabThera. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with MabThera. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with MabThera. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with MabThera. This is because MabThera may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether MabThera has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \nSodium \nMabThera 1400 mg contains less than 1 mmol sodium (main component of the cooking/table salt) per \ndose, i.e. it is essentially sodium-free. \n \n \n\n\n\n138 \n\n3 How MabThera is given \n \nHow it is given \nMabThera will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side \neffects. \n \nYou will always be given MabThera as a drip (intra-venous infusion) at the start of your treatment.  \n \nAfter this, you will be given MabThera as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) over \napproximately 5 minutes. There is a peel-off sticker on the glass vial that specifies the medication. \nYour doctor or nurse will place the sticker on the syringe before injection.   \n \nYour doctor will decide when to start MabThera injections. \n \nWhen injected under your skin, it is given in the stomach area, not in other sites of the body, and not \ninto areas of the stomach where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or where there are moles or scars. \n \nMedicines given before each MabThera administration \nBefore you are given MabThera, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n\n \n• MabThera will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \n\nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n• If you respond well to treatment, you may be given MabThera as a maintenance treatment \n\nevery 2 or 3 months for two years.  \n Your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4 Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and need treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese side effects have been fatal. \n \nReactions where the medicine is injected \nMany patients get some local side effects where MabThera is injected. These include: pain, swelling, \nbruising, bleeding, skin redness, itching and rash.  \nYour doctor may decide to stop your MabThera treatment if these reactions are serious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with MabThera. These are often colds, but \nthere have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are listed below under “Other side \neffects”. \n \n\n\n\n139 \n\nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• bacterial or viral infections, bronchitis \n• low number of white blood cells with or without fever or blood cells called “platelets” \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• bald spots on the scalp, chills, headache \n• lower immunity – because of lower levels of anti-bodies called “immunoglobulins” (IgG) in the \n\nblood which help protect against infection. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• infections of the blood (sepsis), pneumonia, shingles, cold, bronchial tube infections, fungal \n\ninfections, infections of unknown origin, sinus inflammation, hepatitis B \n• low number of red blood cells (anaemia), low number of all blood cells  \n• allergic reactions (hypersensitivity),  \n• high blood sugar level, weight loss, swelling in the face and body, high levels of the enzyme \n\n“LDH” in the blood, low calcium levels in the blood \n• unusual feelings of the skin – such as numbness, tingling, pricking, burning, a creeping skin \n\nfeeling, reduced sense of touch \n• feeling restless, problems falling asleep \n• becoming very red in the face and other areas of the skin as a consequence of dilation of the \n\nblood vessels \n• feeling dizzy or anxious \n• producing more tears, tear duct problems, inflamed eye (conjunctivitis) \n• ringing sound in the ears, ear pain \n• heart problems – such as heart attack, uneven or fast heart rate \n• high or low blood pressure (low blood pressure especially when standing upright) \n• tightening of the muscles in the airways which causes wheezing (bronchospasm), inflammation, \n\nirritation in the lungs, throat or sinuses, being short of breath, runny nose \n• being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, pain in the stomach, irritation or ulcers in the throat and \n\nmouth, problems swallowing, constipation, indigestion \n• eating disorders, not eating enough, leading to weight loss \n• hives, increased sweating, night sweats \n• muscle problems – such as tight muscles, joint or muscle pain, back and neck pain \n• tumour pain \n• general discomfort or feeling uneasy or tired, shaking, signs of flu \n• multiple-organ failure. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n• blood clotting problems, decrease of red blood cell production and increase of red blood cell \n\ndestruction (aplastic haemolytic anaemia), swollen or enlarged lymph nodes \n• low mood and loss of interest or enjoyment in doing things, feeling nervous \n• taste problems – such as changes in the way things taste \n• heart problems – such as reduced heart rate or chest pain (angina) \n• asthma, too little oxygen reaching the body organs \n• swelling of the stomach. \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10, 000 people): \n• short term increase in the amount of some types of anti-bodies in the blood (called \n\nimmunoglobulins – IgM), chemical disturbances in the blood caused by break-down of dying \ncancer cells \n\n• nerve damage in arms and legs, paralysed face \n• heart failure \n• inflammation of blood vessels including those leading to skin symptoms \n• respiratory failure \n\n\n\n140 \n\n• damage to the intestinal wall (perforation) \n• severe skin problems causing blisters that can be life-threatening  \n• kidney failure \n• Severe vision loss (sign of brain nerves damage). \n \nNot known (it is not known how often these side effects happen): \n• a reduction in white blood cells which does not happen straight away \n• reduced platelets number just after the infusion – this can be reversed, but can be fatal in rare \n\ncases \n• hearing loss, loss of other senses.  \n \nMabThera may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor.  \n \nIf you are having MabThera with other medicines, some of the side effects you may get may be due to \nthe other medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What MabThera is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given MabThera  \n3. How MabThera is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store MabThera  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MabThera is and what it is used for \n \nWhat MabThera is \nMabThera contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \nMabThera is available as a medicine given as a drip (called MabThera 100 mg or MabThera 500 mg, \nconcentrate for solution for infusion) and as a medicine for injection under your skin: called MabThera \n1400 mg or MabThera 1600 mg, solution for subcutaneous injection). \n \nWhat MabThera is used for \nMabThera 1600 mg is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia -in adults. \n• Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL \n\naffects a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes, which originates from the bone marrow \nand develops in the lymph nodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, \nwhich accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal \nB-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. \n\n MabThera in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually removed \nfrom the body by biological processes-. \n\n \nYou will be given MabThera 1600 mg with other medicines called “chemotherapy”.  \nYou will always be given MabThera as a drip (intra-venous infusion) at the start of your treatment.  \n \nAfter this, you will be given MabThera as an injection under your skin. Your doctor will decide when \nto start MabThera injections. \n \n \n2 What you need to know before you are given MabThera \n \nDo not have MabThera if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you are allergic to hyaluronidase (an enzyme that helps to increase the absorption of injected \n\nactive substance)  \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n\n\n\n144 \n\n• you have a weak immune system. \n \nDo not have MabThera if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera. \n  \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given MabThera if: \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nMabThera could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems.  \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nMabThera. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \nunder 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of MabThera in \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and MabThera  \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause MabThera can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way MabThera works.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given MabThera. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given MabThera \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given MabThera. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because MabThera can cross the placenta and may affect your \nbaby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while \nusing MabThera. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with MabThera. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with MabThera. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with MabThera. This is because MabThera may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether MabThera has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \nSodium \nMabThera 1600 mg contains less than 1 mmol sodium (main component of the cooking/table salt) per \ndose, i.e. it is essentially sodium-free. \n \n \n\n\n\n145 \n\n3 How MabThera is given \n \nHow it is given \nMabThera will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side \neffects. \n \nYou will always be given MabThera as a drip (intra-venous infusion) at the start of your treatment.  \n \nAfter this, you will be given MabThera as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) over \napproximately 7 minutes. There is a peel-off sticker on the glass vial that specifies the medication. \nYour doctor or nurse will place the sticker on the syringe before injection.   \n \nYour doctor will decide when to start MabThera injections. \n \nWhen injected under your skin, it is given in the stomach area, not in other sites of the body, and not \ninto areas of the stomach where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or where there are moles or scars. \n \nMedicines given before each MabThera administration \nBefore you are given MabThera, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n\n \nWhen you are treated with MabThera in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive a \nMabThera infusion on day 0 of cycle 1, then subcutaneous injections on day 1 of each subsequent \ncycle. The total number of cycles is of 6. Each cycle has a duration of 28 days. The chemotherapy \nshould be given after the MabThera administration. \n \nYour doctor will decide if you should receive concomitant supportive therapy. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4 Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and need treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese side effects have been fatal. \n \nReactions where the medicine is injected \nMany patients get some local side effects where MabThera is injected. These include: pain, swelling, \nbruising, bleeding, skin redness, itching and rash.  \n \nYour doctor may decide to stop your MabThera treatment if these reactions are serious. \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with MabThera. These are often colds, but \nthere have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are listed below under “Other side \neffects”. \n \n\n\n\n146 \n\nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• bacterial or viral infections, bronchitis \n• low number of white blood cells with or without fever or blood cells called “platelets” \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• bald spots on the scalp, chills, headache \n• lower immunity – because of lower levels of anti-bodies called “immunoglobulins” (IgG) in the \n\nblood which help protect against infection. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n• infections of the blood (sepsis), pneumonia, shingles, cold, bronchial tube infections, fungal \n\ninfections, infections of unknown origin, sinus inflammation, hepatitis B \n• low number of red blood cells (anaemia), low number of all blood cells  \n• allergic reactions (hypersensitivity),  \n• high blood sugar level, weight loss, swelling in the face and body, high levels of the enzyme \n\n“LDH” in the blood, low calcium levels in the blood \n• unusual feelings of the skin – such as numbness, tingling, pricking, burning, a creeping skin \n\nfeeling, reduced sense of touch \n• feeling restless, problems falling asleep \n• becoming very red in the face and other areas of the skin as a consequence of dilation of the \n\nblood vessels \n• feeling dizzy or anxious \n• producing more tears, tear duct problems, inflamed eye (conjunctivitis) \n• ringing sound in the ears, ear pain \n• heart problems – such as heart attack, uneven or fast heart rate \n• high or low blood pressure (low blood pressure especially when standing upright) \n• tightening of the muscles in the airways which causes wheezing (bronchospasm), inflammation, \n\nirritation in the lungs, throat or sinuses, being short of breath, runny nose \n• being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, pain in the stomach, irritation or ulcers in the throat and \n\nmouth, problems swallowing, constipation, indigestion \n• eating disorders, not eating enough, leading to weight loss \n• hives, increased sweating, night sweats \n• muscle problems – such as tight muscles, joint or muscle pain, back and neck pain \n• tumour pain \n• general discomfort or feeling uneasy or tired, shaking, signs of flu \n• multiple-organ failure. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n• blood clotting problems, decrease of red blood cell production and increase of red blood cell \n\ndestruction (aplastic haemolytic anaemia), swollen or enlarged lymph nodes \n• low mood and loss of interest or enjoyment in doing things, feeling nervous \n• taste problems – such as changes in the way things taste \n• heart problems – such as reduced heart rate or chest pain (angina) \n• asthma, too little oxygen reaching the body organs \n• swelling of the stomach. \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10, 000 people): \n• short term increase in the amount of some types of anti-bodies in the blood (called \n\nimmunoglobulins – IgM), chemical disturbances in the blood caused by break-down of dying \ncancer cells \n\n• nerve damage in arms and legs, paralysed face \n• heart failure \n• inflammation of blood vessels including those leading to skin symptoms \n• respiratory failure \n\n\n\n147 \n\n• damage to the intestinal wall (perforation) \n• severe skin problems causing blisters that can be life-threatening  \n• kidney failure \n• Severe vision loss (sign of brain nerves damage). \n \nNot known (it is not known how often these side effects happen): \n• a reduction in white blood cells which does not happen straight away \n• reduced platelets number just after the infusion – this can be reversed, but can be fatal in rare \n\ncases \n• hearing loss, loss of other senses.  \n \nMabThera may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor.  \n \nIf you are having MabThera with other medicines, some of the side effects you may get may be due to \nthe other medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
