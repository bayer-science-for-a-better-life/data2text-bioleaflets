NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRibavirin BioPartners 200 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach Ribavirin BioPartners film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of ribavirin. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nRound, white, biconvex film-coated tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRibavirin BioPartners is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in \nadults, children 3 years of age and older and adolescents and must only be used as part of a \ncombination regimen with interferon alfa-2b. Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used.  \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e., \nnot alfa-2b). \n \nNa√Øve patients  \nAdult patients: Ribavirin BioPartners is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for the \ntreatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously \ntreated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who are positive \nfor hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid HCV-RNA (see section 4.4).  \n \nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents: Ribavirin BioPartners is intended for use, in a \ncombination regimen with interferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and \nadolescents, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously treated, \nwithout liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.  \nWhen deciding to not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the \ncombination therapy induced a growth inhibition. The reversibility of growth inhibition is uncertain. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevious treatment failure patients  \nAdult patients: Ribavirin BioPartners is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for the \ntreatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have previously responded (with \nnormalisation of ALT at the end of treatment) to interferon alfa monotherapy but who have \nsubsequently relapsed (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis C. \n \nRibavirin BioPartners must be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPlease refer also to the interferon alfa-2b Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for prescribing \ninformation particular to that product. \n \nDose to be administered \nThe dose of Ribavirin BioPartners is based on patient body weight. Ribavirin BioPartners tablets are \nto be administered orally each day in two divided doses (morning and evening) with food. \n \nAdult patients: \nThe dose of Ribavirin BioPartners is based on patient body weight (Table 1). \nRibavirin BioPartners must be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b (3 million international \nunits [MIU] three times a week). The choice of combination regimen is based on the characteristics of \nthe patient. The regimen administered should be selected based on the anticipated efficacy and safety \nof the combination treatment for an individual patient (see section 5.1). \n \nTable 1 Ribavirin BioPartners dose based on body weight  \n\nPatient weight (kg)  Daily Ribavirin BioPartners dose  \nNumber of 200 mg film-coated \n\ntablets  \n< 65  800 mg  4 a  \n\n65 - 80  1,000 mg  5 b  \n81 - 105  1,200 mg  6  c  \n\n> 105  1,400 mg  7 d  \na: 2 morning, 2 evening \nb: 2 morning, 3 evening  \nc: 3 morning, 3 evening  \nd: 3 morning, 4 evening  \n \nRibavirin BioPartners film-coated tablets in combination with interferon alfa-2b: \n \nBased on the results of clinical trials, it is recommended that patients be treated for at least six months. \nDuring those clinical trials in which patients were treated for one year, patients who failed to show a \nvirological response after six months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) were \nunlikely to become sustained virological responders (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection six \nmonths after withdrawal of treatment). \n \nDuration of treatment ‚Äì Na√Øve patients  \n \n‚Ä¢ Genotype Non-1: The decision to extend therapy to one year in patients with negative \n\nHCVRNA after six months of treatment should be based on other prognostic factors (e.g., age \n> 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis). \n \n\nDuration of treatment ‚Äì Retreatment  \n \n‚Ä¢ Genotype 1: Treatment should be continued for another six month period (i.e., a total of one \n\nyear) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA after six months of treatment. \n‚Ä¢ Genotype Non-1: The decision to extend therapy to one year in patients with negative \n\nHCVRNA after six months of treatment should be based on other prognostic factors (e.g., age \n> 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis). \n\n \nChildren 3 years of age and older and adolescents: \nNote: For patients who weigh < 47 kg, or are unable to swallow tablets, ribavirin oral solution is \navailable and should be used if appropriate.  \n \nDosing for children and adolescent patients is determined by body weight for Ribavirin BioPartners \nand by body surface area for interferon alfa-2b. \n \n \nDose to be administered for the combination therapy with interferon alfa-2b: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn clinical studies performed in this population ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b were used in doses of \n15 mg/kg/day and 3 million international units (MIU)/m2 three times a week respectively (Table 2). \n \n\na1 morning, 2 evening \nb2 morning, 2 evening \n \nDuration of treatment in children and adolescents \n\nÔÇ∑ Genotype 2 or 3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks. \n \nDose modification for all patients \nIf severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during therapy with ribavirin and \ninterferon alfa-2b, modify the dosages of each product if appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate. \nGuidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification (see Dosage modification \nguidelines, Table 3). As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be \nkept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose. The potential negative impact of ribavirin \ndose reduction on efficacy results could not be ruled out. \n \nTable 3 Dosage modification guidelines based on laboratory parameters \n\nLaboratory values \n\nReduce only Ribavirin \nBioPartners \ndaily dose \n\n(see note 1) if: \n\nReduce only \ninterferon alfa-2b dose \n\n(see note 2) if: \n\nDiscontinue \ncombination therapy \nwhen the below test \nvalue is reported:** \n\nHaemoglobin < 10 g/dl - < 8.5 g/dl \nAdults: \nHaemoglobin in: \npatients with \nhistory of stable \ncardiac disease \nChildren and \nadolescents: not \napplicable (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n \n‚â• 2 g/dl decrease in haemoglobin during any \n\n4 week period during treatment \n(permanent dose reduction) \n\n \n< 12 g/dl after 4 weeks \n\nof dose \nreduction \n\nLeukocytes - < 1.5 x 109/l < 1.0 x 109/l \nNeutrophils - < 0.75 x 109/l < 0.5 x 109/l \nPlatelets - < 50 x 109/l (adults) \n\n< 70 x 109/l (children \nand adolescents) \n\n< 25 x 109/l (adults) \n< 50 x 109/l \n\n(children and \nadolescents) \n\nBilirubin ‚Äì Direct - - 2.5 x ULN* \nBilirubin ‚Äì \nIndirect \n\n> 5 mg/dl - > 4 mg/dl (adults) \n> 5 mg/dl \n\n(for > 4 weeks) \n(children and \n\nadolescents treated \nwith interferon alfa-2b), \n\n \nSerum Creatinine - -- > 2.0 mg/dl \nCreatinine - - Discontinue Ribavirin \n\nTable 2 Ribavirin BioPartners dose based on body weight when used in combination   with \ninterferon alfa-2b in children and adolescents \n\nPatient weight (kg)  Daily Ribavirin BioPartners dose  Number of 200 mg tablets  \n\n47 - 49  600 mg  3 tablets a  \n50 - 65  800 mg  4 tablets b  \n\n> 65  Refer to adult dosing table (Table 1)  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nClearance BioPartners \nif \n\nCrCl < 50 ml/minute \nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) \n\nor \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) \n\n- - 2 x baseline and \n> 10 x ULN* \n\n \nor \n\n2 x baseline and \n> 10 x ULN* \n\n* Upper limit of normal \n** Refer to the SPC for interferon alfa-2b for dose modification and discontinuation. \n \n\nNote 1: In adult patients, 1st dose reduction of Ribavirin BioPartners is by 200 mg/day (except in \npatients receiving the 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, \n2nd dose reduction of Ribavirin BioPartners is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose \ndose of Ribavirin BioPartners is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg tablet in the \nmorning and two 200 mg tablets in the evening. \nIn children and adolescent patients treated with Ribavirin BioPartners plus interferon \nalfa-2b, reduce ribavirin dose to 7.5 mg/kg/day. \n\nNote 2: In adult patients and children and adolescent patients treated with Ribavirin BioPartners plus \ninterferon alfa-2b, reduce the interferon alfa-2b dose by one-half dose. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nUse in renal impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin are altered in patients with renal \ndysfunction due to reduction of apparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). \nTherefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of \nribavirin. Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ribavirin (see \nsection 4.3). Subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to \nthe development of anaemia. If serum creatinine rises to > 2.0 mg/dl (Table 3), Ribavirin BioPartners \nand interferon alfa-2b must be discontinued. \n \nUse in hepatic impairment: No pharmacokinetic interaction appears between ribavirin and hepatic \nfunction (see section 5.2). Therefore, no dose adjustment of ribavirin is required in patients with \nhepatic impairment. The use of ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment \nor decompensated cirrhosis (see section 4.3). \n \nUse in the elderly (‚â• 65 years of age): There does not appear to be a significant age-related effect on \nthe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin. However, as in younger patients, renal function must be determined \nprior to administration of Ribavirin (see section 5.2). \n \nUse in patients under the age of 18 years: Ribavirin may be used in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b in children 3 years of age and older and adolescents. The selection of the formulation is based \non individual characteristics of the patient (see section 4.1). Safety and effectiveness of ribavirin with \nother forms of interferon (i.e. not alfa-2b) in these patients have not been evaluated. \n \nPatients co-infected with HCV/HIV: Patients taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) \ntreatment in association with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b may be at increased risk of mitochondrial \ntoxicity, lactic acidosis and hepatic decompensation (see section 4.4). Please refer also to the relevant \nproduct information for antiretroviral medicinal products. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n- Pregnant women (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). Ribavirin BioPartners must not be initiated until \na report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of \ntherapy. \n\n- Lactation. \n- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease, in the previous six months (see section 4.4). \n- Patients with severe, debilitating medical conditions. \n- Patients with chronic renal failure, patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute and/or on  \n\nhaemodialysis. \n- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classification B or C) or decompensated cirrhosis of  \n\nthe liver. \n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia). \n- Initiation of peginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a \n\nChild-Pugh score ‚â•6.  \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n- Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal \n\nideation, or suicide attempt.  \n \nBecause of co-administration with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b: \n- Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS): \nSevere CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been \nobserved in some patients during ribavirin combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up \nperiod. Among children and adolescents, treated with ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b, \nsuicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % versus \n1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children \nand adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g. depression, emotional lability, \nand somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against \nothers such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorder, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status \nhave been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or \nsymptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these \nundesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate \ntherapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal \nideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with Ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as \nappropriate. \n \nPatients with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with Ribavirin in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with \nexistence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured \nappropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.  \nThe use of Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with substance use/abuse: \nHCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at \nan increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing \npsychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interferon is \njudged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential for \nother substance use should be carefully assessed and adequately managed before initiating \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\ntherapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or \naddiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should \nbe closely monitored during therapy and even after treatment discontinuation. Early intervention \nfor re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended. \n \n \nGrowth and development (children and adolescents): \nDuring the course of interferon (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in \npatients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard \ninterferon/ribavirin are also indicative of substantial growth retardation (> 15 percentile decrease in \nheight percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children despite being off treatment for more \nthan 5 years. \n \nCase by case benefit/risk assessment in children: \nThe expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for \nchildren and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n‚Äì It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition, the \n\nreversibility of which is uncertain. \n‚Äì This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of \n\ndisease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively influence the disease \nprogression (such as HIV-co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response (HCV \ngenotype and viral load). \n\n \nWhenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the \nrisk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. \n \nBased on results of clinical trials, the use of ribavirin as monotherapy is not effective and Ribavirin \nmust not be used alone. The safety and efficacy of this combination have been established only using \nribavirin together with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b solution for injection. \n \nAll patients in selected chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain \ncases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological \nconfirmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed \nprior to commencing treatment. \n \nHaemolysis: A decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dl was observed in up to 14 % of adult \npatients and 7 % of children and adolescents treated with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon \nalfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in clinical trials. Although ribavirin has no direct cardiovascular effects, \nanaemia associated with ribavirin may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of \nthe symptoms of coronary disease, or both. Thus, ribavirin must be administered with caution to \npatients with pre-existing cardiac disease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start \nof therapy and monitored clinically during therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be \nstopped (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiovascular: Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or \nprevious or current arrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those \npatients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and \nduring the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to \nconventional therapy but may require discontinuation of therapy. There are no data in children or \nadolescents with a history of cardiac disease. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity: If an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, \nbronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) develops, Ribavirin must be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate medical therapy instituted. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nOcular changes: Ribavirin is used in combination therapy with alpha interferons. Retinopathy \nincluding retinal haemorrhages, retinal exudates, papilloedema, optic neuropathy and retinal artery or \nvein occlusion which may result in loss of vision have been reported in rare instances with \ncombination therapy with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any \npatient complaining of decrease or loss of vision must have a prompt and complete eye examination. \nPatients with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should \nreceive periodic ophthalmologic exams during combination therapy with alpha interferons. \nCombination therapy with alpha interferons should be discontinued in patients who develop new or \nworsening ophthalmologic disorders. \n \nLiver function: Any patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must \nbe monitored closely. Discontinue treatment in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation \nmarkers which might indicate liver decompensation. \n \nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression: Pancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been \nreported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and \nribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon \nwithdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon \nreintroduction of either treatment alone (see section 4.5). \n  \nThyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents: \nApproximately 12 to 21 % of children treated with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and \nnonpegylated) developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another approximately 4 % \nhad a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of interferon alfa-2b \ntherapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be \ntreated with conventional therapy. Interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated) therapy may be \ninitiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction \nduring treatment with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b and during treatment with ribavirin and \npeginterferon alfa-2b has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient‚Äôs thyroid \nstatus should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be \nmonitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH). \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infection: \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: \nCaution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon \nalfa-2b/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians \nshould carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis when ribavirin is \nadministered. In particular: \n- co-administration of Ribavirin BioPartners and didanosine is not recommended due to the risk \n\nof mitochondrial toxicity (see section 4.5). \n- co-administration of Ribavirin BioPartners and stavudine should be avoided to limit the risk of \n\noverlapping mitochondrial toxicity. \n \n\nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) \nmay be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons \nalone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Other baseline \nfactors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation \ninclude treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentrations. \nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Patients progressing to hepatic \ndecompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV \ntreatment reassessed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients: \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may \nbe at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below ‚ÄúLaboratory tests‚Äù and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with ribavirin and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, \nthe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with low CD4 counts: \nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/¬µl. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts. \n \nPlease refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with Ribavirin \nBioPartners and peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nDental and periodontal disorders: Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, \nhave been reported in patients receiving ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \ncombination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous \nmembranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of ribavirin and \npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and \nhave regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction \noccurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nLaboratory tests: Standard haematologic tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and \ndifferential, platelet count, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) must be \nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered \nas a guideline prior to initiation of Ribavirin therapy: \n \nÔÇ∑ Haemoglobin  Adults: ‚â• 12 g/dl (females); ‚â• 13 g/dl (males) \n\n Children and adolescents: ‚â• 11 g/dl (females); ‚â• 12 g/dl (males) \nÔÇ∑ Platelets ‚â• 100,000/mm3 \nÔÇ∑ Neutrophil Count ‚â• 1,500/mm3 \n \nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nFor females of childbearing potential: Female patients must have a routine pregnancy test performed \nmonthly during treatment and for four months thereafter. Female partners of male patients must have a \nroutine pregnancy test performed monthly during treatment and for seven months thereafter (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nUric acid may increase with ribavirin due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for development of \ngout must be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of ribavirin. Ribavirin does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. \nThere is no evidence from toxicity studies that ribavirin induces liver enzymes. Therefore, there is a \nminimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \nazathioprine. The use of pegylated alpha interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine \nshould be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done \nduring concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with \nthese medicines should be stopped (see section 4.4). \n \nNo interaction studies have been conducted with ribavirin and other medicinal products, except for \npeginterferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b and antacids. \n \nInterferon alfa-2b: No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ribavirin and peginterferon \nalfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study. \n \nAntacid: The bioavailability of ribavirin 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid \ncontaining magnesium aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14 %. It is possible that the \ndecreased bioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. This \ninteraction is not considered to be clinically relevant. \n \nNucleoside analogs: Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has \nresulted in lactic acidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine \nnucleosides in vitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine \nnucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of Ribavirin BioPartners and \ndidanosine is not recommended. Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and \npancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see section 4.4). \nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a \nknown history of zidovudine induced anaemia. \n \nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for ribavirin) after \ncessation of ribavirin therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no evidence that ribavirin interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \nprotease inhibitors. \n \nConflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and ribavirin. \nSome data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at \nrisk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Caution should be exercised \nwhen both medicines are co-administered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe use of Ribavirin BioPartners is contraindicated during pregnancy. \n \nPreclinical data: \n- Fertility: In animal studies, ribavirin produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \n\nribavirin in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at \ndoses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3). \n\n- Genotoxicity: Ribavirin induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\nFemale patients: Ribavirin must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Ribavirin therapy \nmust not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to \ninitiation of therapy. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during \ntreatment and for four months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy tests \nmust be performed during this time. If pregnancy does occur during treatment or within four months \nfrom stopping treatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic risk of ribavirin to \nthe foetus. \n \nMale patients and their female partners: Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of \nmale patients taking Ribavirin (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). Ribavirin accumulates intracellularly and is \ncleared from the body very slowly. It is unknown whether the ribavirin that is contained in sperm will \nexert its potential teratogenic or genotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus. Although data on \napproximately 300 prospectively followed pregnancies with paternal exposure to ribavirin have not \nshown an increased risk of malformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern \nof malformation, either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to \nuse an effective contraceptive during treatment with Ribavirin and for seven months after treatment. \nMen whose partners are pregnant must be instructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of ribavirin \nto the partner. \n \nBreast-feeding: It is not known whether ribavirin is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential \nfor adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of \ntreatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRibavirin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, \npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b used in combination may have an effect. Thus, patients who \ndevelop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or \noperating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdult patients:  \nThe safety of ribavirin is evaluated from data from four clinical trials in patients with no previous \nexposure to interferon (interferon-na√Øve patients): two trials studied ribavirin in combination with \ninterferon alfa-2b, two trials studied ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nPatients who are treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin after previous relapse from interferon \ntherapy or who are treated for a shorter period are likely to have an improved safety profile than that \ndescribed below. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 4 are based on experience from clinical trials in adult na√Øve \npatients treated for 1 year and post-marketing use. A certain number of adverse reactions, generally \nattributed to interferon therapy but that have been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (in \ncombination with ribavirin) are also listed for reference in Table 4. Also, refer to peginterferon alfa-2b \nand interferon alfa-2b SPCs for adverse reactions that may be attributable to interferons monotherapy. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (‚â•1/10); common (‚â•1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (‚â• 1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (‚â•1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 4 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of

\nInvestigations \nVery common: Weight decrease \nCommon: Cardiac murmur \n* Since ribavirin is always prescribed with an alpha interferon product, and the listed adverse drug reactions included \nreflecting post-marketing experience do not allow precise quantification of frequency, the frequency reported above is from \nclinical trials using ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated or non-pegylated). \n \nA reduction in haemoglobin concentrations by > 4 g/dl was observed in 30 % of patients treated with \nribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b and 37 % of patients treated with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b. \nHaemoglobin levels dropped below 10 g/dl in up to 14 % of adult patients and 7 % of children and \nadolescents treated with ribavirin in combination with either peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b. \n \nMost cases of anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2). There \nwere some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with ribavirin in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of 186 [7 %]); WHO \ngrade 3 leukopenia was also reported in 7 % of this treatment group. \n \nAn increase in uric acid and indirect bilirubin values associated with haemolysis was observed in some \npatients treated with ribavirin used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in \nclinical trials, but values returned to baseline levels by four weeks after the end of therapy. Among \nthose patients with elevated uric acid levels, very few patients treated with the combination developed \nclinical gout, none of which required treatment modification or discontinuation from the clinical trials. \n \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients: \nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other \nadverse reactions (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nstudies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), CD4 \nlymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9 %), \nback pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic hepatitis \n(6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %). \n \nMitochondrial toxicity: \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated-ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients: \nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon \nalfa-2b when compared to patients receiving ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b.

Anaemia \n(haemoglobin < 9.4 g/dl) was reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with ribavirin in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nCD4 lymphocytes decrease: \nTreatment with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b was associated with decreases in \nabsolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The \ndecrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of \nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b had no observable negative impact on the control \nof HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N = 25) are available in co-infected \npatients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/¬µl (see section 4.4). \n \nPlease refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ribavirin in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % \nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition is observed, the \nreversibility of which is uncertain (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients). \n \nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20 % of the children continued \nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Based on interim data from the long-term \nfollow-up portion of this study, 22 % (16/74) of children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height \npercentile, of whom 3 (4 %) children had a > 30 percentile decrease despite being off treatment for \nmore than 1 year. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile at year 1 of long term follow-up \nwas most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). \n \nIn this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80 %), headache \n(62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site erythema (29 %). Only \n1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction (thrombocytopenia). The majority \nof adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions \nwere reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1 %), pain in extremity \n(1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). Important treatment-emergent adverse \nreactions that occurred in this patient population were nervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger \n(2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and hypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received \nlevothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated TSH. \n \nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b \nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age treated with combination therapy \nof interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the \nadverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\npercentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up \npost-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was below the median \nof the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) \nof 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of whom 10 of the 20 children had a \n> 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term \nfollow-up (up to 5 years). During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-2b and \nribavirin, growth inhibition is observed, the reversibility of which is uncertain. In particular, decrease \nin mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term follow-up was most prominent in \nprepubertal age children (see section 4.4). \n \nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs. 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions (e.g., \ndepression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, \npyrexia, anorexia, vomiting and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and \nadolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most \ncommonly for anaemia and neutropenia. \n \nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on experience from the two multicentre \nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using ribavirin with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (‚â• 1/10); common (‚â• 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (‚â• 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 5 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical \n\ntrials in children and adolescents with ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions \nInfections and infestations \nVery common: Viral infection, pharyngitis \nCommon: Fungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, \n\nnasopharyngitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, \nsinusitis, tooth abscess, influenza, oral herpes, herpes \nsimplex, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, gastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm unspecified \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Anaemia, neutropenia \nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy \nEndocrine disorders \nVery common: Hypothyroidism \nCommon: Hyperthyroidism, virilism \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia, increased appetite, decreased appetite \nCommon: Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: Depression, insomnia, emotional lability \nCommon: Suicidal ideation, aggression, confusion, affect liability, \n\nbehaviour disorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, mood \naltered, restlessness, nervousness, sleep disorder, abnormal \ndreaming, apathy \n\nUncommon: Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, \nfear, nightmare \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache, dizziness \nCommon: Hyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, \nsomnolence, disturbance in attention, poor quality of sleep \n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland \n\ndisorder \nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision \n\nblurred, photophobia \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, palpitations \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Pallor, flushing \nUncommon: Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, \n\nnasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, pharyngolaryngeal \npain \n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort \nGastro-intestinal disorders \nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting , diarrhoea, \n\nnausea \nCommon: Mouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, aphthous \n\nstomatitis, dyspepsia, cheilosis, glossitis, gastroesophoageal \nreflux, rectal disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, constipation, \nloose stools, toothache, tooth disorder, stomach discomfort, \noral pain \n\nUncommon: Gingivitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal \nUncommon: Hepatomegaly \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common: Alopecia, rash \nCommon: Pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, \n\neczema, hyperhidrosis, acne, skin disorder, nail disorder, skin \ndiscolouration, dry skin, erythema, bruise \n\nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin exfoliation \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nCommon: Pain in extremity, back pain, muscle contracture \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence, \n\nproteinuria \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, \n\nvaginal disorder, Male: testicular pain \nUncommon: Female: dysmenorrhoea \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, injection \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nsite erythema, injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, pyrexia, \ninfluenza-like illness, asthenia, malaise, irritability \n\nCommon: Chest pain, oedema, pain, injection site pruritus, injection site \nrash, injection site dryness, feeling cold \n\nUncommon: Chest discomfort, facial pain, injection site induration \nInvestigations \nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age) \nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin \n\nincreased \nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nCommon: Skin laceration \nUncommon: Contusion \n \nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the ribavirin/peginterferon alfa-2b clinical trial were mild \nor moderate. Decreases in haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and increase in \nbilirubin may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy (see section 4.2). \nWhile changes in laboratory values were observed in some patients treated with ribavirin used in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b in the clinical trial, values returned to baseline levels within a \nfew weeks after the end of therapy. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials with ribavirin used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, the \nmaximum overdose reported was a total dose of 10 g of ribavirin (50 x 200 mg) and 39 MIU of \ninterferon alfa-2b (13 subcutaneous injections of 3 MIU each) taken in one day by a patient in an \nattempt at suicide. The patient was observed for two days in the emergency room, during which time \nno adverse reaction from the overdose was noted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct acting antivirals, nucleosides and nucleotides (excl. reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors), ATC code: J05AB04. \n \nRibavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity against some RNA and \nDNA viruses. The mechanism by which ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b exerts its \neffects against HCV is unknown. Oral formulations of ribavirin monotherapy have been investigated \nas therapy for chronic hepatitis C in several clinical trials. Results of these investigations showed that \nribavirin monotherapy had no effect on eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or improving hepatic \nhistology after 6 to 12 months of therapy and 6 months of follow-up. \n \nRibavirin clinical trials in adults \nThe use of ribavirin in combination treatment with interferon alfa-2b was evaluated in a number of \nclinical trials. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive \nHCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a \nhistological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal \nserum ALT. \n \nNa√Øve patients \nThree trials examined the use of interferon in na√Øve patients, two with ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b \n(C95-132 and I95-143) and one with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b (C/I98-580). In all cases the \ntreatment was for one year with a follow-up of six months. The sustained response at the end of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nfollow-up was significantly increased by the addition of ribavirin to interferon alfa-2b (41 % vs 16 %, \np < 0.001). \n \nIn clinical trials C95-132 and I95-143, ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination therapy proved to be \nsignificantly more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (a doubling in sustained response). \nCombination therapy also decreased the relapse rate. \n \nIn clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 na√Øve patients were treated for one year with one of the following \ncombination regimens: \nÔÇ∑ Ribavirin (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n = 511). \nÔÇ∑ Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one \n\nmonth followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n = 514). \nÔÇ∑ Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n = 505). \n \nIn this trial, the combination of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) was \nsignificantly more effective than the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b, particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1. Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months \nafter the cessation of treatment.  \n \nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. \nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \nadministered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that \nreceived > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral \nload, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ‚â§ 10.6 mg/kg \nribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even \nhigher. \n \nTable 6 Sustained response rates with Ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b  \n (by ribavirin dose [mg/kg], genotype and viral load) \nHCV Genotype  \n \n\nRibavirin dose \n(mg/kg) \n\nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R \n \n\nI/R \n \n\nAll Genotypes All 54 % 47 % 47 % \nÔÇ£ 10.6 50 % 41 % 27 % \n> 10.6 61 % 48 % 47 % \n\nGenotype 1 All 42 % 34 % 33 % \nÔÇ£ 10.6 38 % 25 % 20 % \n> 10.6 48 % 34 % 34 % \n\n Genotype 1  \n ÔÇ£ 600,000 IU/ml \n\nAll 73 % 51 % 45 % \nÔÇ£ 10.6 74 % 25 % 33 % \n> 10.6 71 % 52 % 45 % \n\n Genotype 1 \n > 600,000 IU/ml \n\nAll 30 % 27 % 29 % \nÔÇ£ 10.6 27 % 25 % 17 % \n> 10.6 37 % 27 % 29 % \n\nGenotype 2/3 All 82 % 80 % 79 % \nÔÇ£ 10.6 79 % 73 % 50 % \n> 10.6 88 % 80 % 80 % \n\nP1.5/R Ribavirin (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg)  \nP0.5/R Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) \nI/R Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.

Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV.

Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were coinfected \nwith HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) \nplus peginterferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 Œºg/week based on weight) or ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day \nbased on weight) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW).

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. \n \nHistological response \nLiver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the \n412 subjects (51 %). Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with \nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. This decline was significant among responders \n(-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among \nnon-responders. In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and \nnone showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. \nSteatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3. \n \nRetreatment of relapse patients with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment \nTwo trials examined the use of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse \npatients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous \ninterferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up. Combination therapy \nwith ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b resulted in a sustained virological response that was ten-fold \nhigher than that with interferon alfa-2b alone (49 % vs 5 %, p < 0.0001). This benefit was maintained \nirrespective of standard predictors of response to interferon alfa-2b such as virus level, HCV genotype \nand histological staging. \n \nLong-term efficacy data - Adults \nTwo large long-term follow-up studies enrolled 1,071 patients and 567 patients after treatment in prior \nstudies with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) and pegylated interferon \nalfa-2b (with or without ribavirin), respectively. The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the \ndurability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on \nclinical outcomes. At least 5 years of long-term follow-up was completed after treatment in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n462 patients and 327 patients, respectively. Twelve out of 492 sustained responders and only 3 out of \n366 sustained responders relapsed, respectively, in the studies. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 97 % (95 % CI: 95-99 %) \nfor patients receiving non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin), and is 99 % (95 % \nCI: 98-100 %) for patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin). \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and non-pegylated, with or \nwithout ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic \ninfection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of \nhepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nRibavirin clinical trials in children and adolescents: \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 \n3 times a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment. A total of 118 patients were \nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % ÔÇ£ 12 years of age. The population \nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials, \nsustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to \nthe lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon \nalfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).The study \nresults are summarized in Table 8. \n \nTable 8 Sustained virological response in previously untreated children and adolescents \n Ribavirin 15 mg/kg/day  \n\n+ \ninterferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week \n\nOverall Responsea (n = 118) 54 (46 %)* \n\nGenotype 1 (n = 92) 33 (36 %)* \n\nGenotype 2/3/4 (n = 26) 21 (81 %)* \n\n* Number (%) of patients \na.

Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. \n \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax= 1.5 hours), \nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively). Absorption is extensive with \napproximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces. However, absolute bioavailability \nis approximately 45 %-65 %, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism. There is a linear \nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin. Volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins. \n \nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability \nfollowing single oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30 % for both AUC and Cmax), \nwhich may be due to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood \ncompartment. \n \nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and \nhas been identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of \ntransporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of \nribavirin. The ratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess \nof ribavirin in whole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes. \n \nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite. \nBoth ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted \nrenally. \n \nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of \nmultiple-dose to single-dose AUC12hr. Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was \nreached by approximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately \n2,200 ng/ml. Upon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which \nprobably reflects slow elimination from non-plasma compartments. \n \nTransfer into seminal fluid: Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in \nseminal fluid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic \nexposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and \nremains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. \n \nFood effect: The bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration \nof a high fat meal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70 %). It is possible that the increased \nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. The clinical \nrelevance of results from this single dose study is unknown. In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, \npatients were instructed to take ribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of \nribavirin. \n \nRenal function: Single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics were altered (increased AUCtf and Cmax) in \npatients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance > 90 ml/minute). \nThis appears to be due to reduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations \nare essentially unchanged by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic function: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe \nhepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) are similar to those of normal controls. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nElderly patients (‚â• 65 years of age): Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not \nbeen performed. However, in a population pharmacokinetic study, age was not a key factor in the \nkinetics of ribavirin; renal function is the determining factor. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using sparsely sampled serum concentration \nvalues from four controlled clinical trials. The clearance model developed showed that body weight, \ngender, age, and serum creatinine were the main covariates. For males, clearance was approximately \n20 % higher than for females. Clearance increased as a function of body weight and was reduced at \nages greater than 40 years. Effects of these covariates on ribavirin clearance appear to be of limited \nclinical significance due to the substantial residual variability not accounted for by the model. \n \nChildren and adolescents: \n \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 9. The \npharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and \nchildren or adolescents. \n \nTable 9 Mean (% CV) multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for interferon alfa-2b and \n\nRibavirin when administered to children or adolescents with chronic \n hepatitis C  \n\nParameter Ribavirin \n15 mg/kg/day as 2 divided \n\ndoses \n(n = 17) \n\nInterferon alfa-2b \n3 MIU/m2 3 times a week \n\n(n = 54) \n\nTmax (hr) 1.9 (83) 5.9 (36) \nCmax (ng/ml) 3,275 (25) 51 (48) \nAUC* 29,774 (26) 622 (48) \nApparent clearance l/hr/kg 0.27 (27) Not done \n*AUC12 (ng.hr/ml) for Ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/ml) for interferon alfa-2b \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRibavirin: Ribavirin is embryotoxic or teratogenic, or both, at doses well below the recommended \nhuman dose in all animal species in which studies have been conducted. Malformations of the skull, \npalate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of \nteratogenic effects increased with escalation of the dose. Survival of foetuses and offspring was \nreduced. \n \nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length. At the end of the recovery \nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \ncontrols. No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed \nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development. Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose. \n \nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies. Anaemia occurs shortly \nafter initiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment. \n \nIn 3- and 6-month studies in mice to investigate Ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \nabnormalities in sperm, occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above. These doses in animals produce \nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses. Upon cessation of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or \ntwo spermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6). \n \nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity. Ribavirin \nwas active in the Balb/3T3 in vitro Transformation Assay. Genotoxic activity was observed in the \nmouse lymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay. A dominant \nlethal assay in rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted \nthrough male gametes. \n \nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under \ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin. In \naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure). These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely. \n \nRibavirin plus interferon: When used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, \nribavirin did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone. The major \ntreatment-related change was a reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater \nthan that produced by either active substance alone. \n \n \n6.

How to store Ribavirin BioPartners \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT RIBAVIRIN BIOPARTNERS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nRibavirin BioPartners contains the active ingredient ribavirin. Ribavirin BioPartners stops the \nmultiplication of many types of viruses, including hepatitis C virus. Ribavirin BioPartners must not be \nused without interferon alfa-2b, i.e. Ribavirin BioPartners must not be used alone. \n \nPreviously untreated patients: \nThe combination of Ribavirin BioPartners with interferon alfa-2b is used to treat patients 3 years of \nage and older who have chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection, except genotype 1. For children and \nadolescents weighing less than 47 kg a solution formulation is available. \n \nPreviously treated adult patients: \nThe combination of Ribavirin BioPartners with interferon alfa-2b is used to treat adult patients with \nchronic hepatitis C, who have previously responded to a treatment with an alpha interferon alone, but \nwhose condition has recurred. \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e., \nnot alfa-2b). \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE RIBAVIRIN BIOPARTNERS \n \nRibavirin BioPartners is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 3 years. \n \nDo not take Ribavirin BioPartners \nIf any of the following apply to you or your child you are caring for, do not take Ribavirin \nBioPartners, and tell your doctor if you: \nÔÇ∑ are allergic (hypersensitive) to ribavirin or any of the other ingredients of Ribavirin BioPartners \n\n(see section 6, further information). \nÔÇ∑ are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see section ‚ÄúPregnancy and breast-feeding‚Äù). \nÔÇ∑ have any severe medical conditions that leave you very weak, including severe kidney disease.  \nÔÇ∑ are breast-feeding. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\nÔÇ∑ have had any previous severe heart problems, or have had any problems with the heart in the \nlast 6 months. \n\nÔÇ∑ have had severe liver problems, which are not related to hepatitis C.  \nÔÇ∑  have suffered from any blood disorder, for example anaemia (low blood count), thalassemia or \n\nsickle-cell anaemia.  \nÔÇ∑  have suffered from autoimmune disease in the past, or suffer from autoimmune hepatitis, or are \n\ntaking other medicines that suppress your immune system (that protects you against infection \nand some diseases).  \n \n\nChildren and adolescents must not take combination therapy with Ribavirin BioPartners and alpha \ninterferon when there is existence or history of serious nervous or mental problems, such as severe \ndepression, thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide. \n \nYou should tell your doctor if you have suffered from any other serious illness in the past.  \n \nReminder: Please read the ‚ÄúDo not use‚Äù section of the Package Leaflet for interferon alfa-2b before \n\nyou begin combination treatment with Ribavirin BioPartners. \n \nTake special care with Ribavirin BioPartners \nSeek medical advice immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as \ndifficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents weighing less than 47 kg: \nThe use of Ribavirin BioPartners tablets is not recommended.  \n \nYou should tell your doctor if you or your child you are caring for: \nÔÇ∑ are an adult who has or had a severe nervous or mental disorder, confusion, unconsciousness, \n\nor have had thoughts of suicide or have attempted suicide, or have a history of substance \nabuse (e.g., alcohol or drugs). \n\nÔÇ∑ have ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feeling of \nsadness, dejection, etc.) while on treatment with Ribavirin. \n\nÔÇ∑ are a woman of childbearing age (see section ‚ÄúPregnancy and breast-feeding‚Äù). \nÔÇ∑ are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section ‚ÄúPregnancy and \n\nbreast-feeding‚Äù). \nÔÇ∑ had a previous serious heart condition or have cardiac disease. \nÔÇ∑ are older than 65 years or if you have problems with your kidneys. \nÔÇ∑ have or have had any serious illness. \nÔÇ∑ have thyroid problems. \n \nDuring treatment with Ribavirin in combination therapy with an alpha interferon, dental and gum \ndisorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported. In addition, dry mouth that could \nhave a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth has been reported during long-term \ntreatment with ribavirin in combination therapy with an alpha interferon. You should brush your teeth \nthoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may \nexperience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards. \n \nDuring treatment with Ribavirin BioPartners in combination therapy with an alpha interferon, patients \nmay experience eye problems, or loss of vision in rare instances. If you receive ribavirin in \ncombination with an alpha interferon, you should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient \ncomplaining of decrease or loss of vision must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Patients \nwith pre-existing eye disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic eye \nexams during combination therapy with ribavirin and an alpha interferon. Combination therapy with \nribavirin and an alpha interferon should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening \neye disorders. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\nReminder: Please read the ‚ÄúTake special care‚Äù section of the Package Leaflet for interferon alfa-2b \nbefore you begin combination treatment. \n\n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for: \n\n- are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without \na prescription. \n\n- are receiving azathioprine in combination with ribavirin and pegylated alpha interferons and, \ntherefore may be at an increased risk of developing severe blood disorders. \n\n- are infected with both Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-positive) and Hepatitis C \nVirus (HCV) and are being treated with an anti-HIV medicinal product(s) - [nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and/or highly active anti-retroviral therapy \n(HAART)]: \n‚Äì Taking Ribavirin BioPartners in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-HIV \n\nmedicinal product(s) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood \nabnormalities development (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry \noxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called \nplatelets). \n\n‚Äì With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if Ribavirin BioPartners will change \nthe way these medicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be \nsure that the HIV infection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will \ndecide whether or not your Ribavirin BioPartners treatment needs to be changed. \nAdditionally, patients receiving zidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha \ninterferons could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red \nblood cells). Therefore the use of zidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha \ninterferons is not recommended. \n\n‚Äì Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and \npancreatitis, the use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of \nribavirin and stavudine should be avoided. \n\n‚Äì Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving HAART may be at \nincreased risk of worsening liver function. Adding treatment with an alpha interferon \nalone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\n \nReminder: Please read the ‚ÄúTaking other medicines‚Äù section of the Package Leaflet for interferon \n\nalfa-2b before you begin combination treatment. \n \nTaking Ribavirin BioPartners with food and drink \nRibavirin BioPartners must be taken with food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, you must not take Ribavirin BioPartners. Ribavirin BioPartners can be very \ndamaging to your unborn baby (embryo). \n \nBoth female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \npossibility for pregnancy to occur: \n- Girl or woman of childbearing age: \n\nYou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for \nthe 4 months after treatment is stopped. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n\n- Men: \nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the \npossibility for ribavirin to be left in the woman‚Äôs body. \nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for \npregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. \nYou or your female partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking \nRibavirin BioPartners and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with \nyour doctor (see section ‚ÄúDo not take Ribavirin BioPartners‚Äù). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n37 \n\n \nIf you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take Ribavirin BioPartners. Discontinue \nbreast-feeding before starting to take Ribavirin BioPartners. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRibavirin BioPartners does not affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, interferon \nalfa-2b may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Therefore,. do not drive or use machines if \nyou become tired, sleepy, or confused from this treatment. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE RIBAVIRIN BIOPARTNERS \n \nGeneral information about taking Ribavirin BioPartners: \nIf the child you are caring for is under the age of 3 years, do not administer. \n \nAlways take Ribavirin BioPartners exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nDo not take more than the recommended dosage and take the medicine for as long as prescribed. Your \ndoctor has determined the correct dose of Ribavirin BioPartners based on how much you or the child \nyou are caring for weighs. \n \nStandard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function. \n\n- Blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working. \n- Depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of \n\ntablets you or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of Ribavirin \nBioPartners, and/or change the length of time to take this treatment. \n\n- If you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped. \n \nThe usual dose, according to how much the patient weighs, is shown in the table below: \n1.
