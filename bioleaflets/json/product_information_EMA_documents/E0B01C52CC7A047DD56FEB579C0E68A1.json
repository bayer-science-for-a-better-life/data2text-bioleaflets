NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nDaurismo 25 mg film-coated tablets \nDaurismo 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \nDaurismo 25 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains glasdegib maleate equivalent to 25 mg of glasdegib. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 1.3 mg of lactose monohydrate.  \n \n\nDaurismo 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains glasdegib maleate equivalent to 100 mg of glasdegib. \n\n \nExcipient with known effect \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 5.0 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \nDaurismo 25 mg film-coated tablets  \n\n \n\n7 mm round, yellow film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “GLS 25” on the other \n\nside.  \n\n \n\nDaurismo 100 mg film-coated tablets  \n \n\n11 mm round, pale orange film-coated tablet debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “GLS 100” on \n\nthe other side.  \n\n \n\n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDaurismo is indicated, in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed \n\nde novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adult patients who are not candidates for \n\nstandard induction chemotherapy.  \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nDaurismo should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use \nof anticancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 mg glasdegib once daily in combination with low-dose cytarabine (see \nsection 5.1). Glasdegib should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit.  \n\n \n\nDelayed or missed doses of glasdegib \n\nIf a dose is vomited, a replacement dose should not be administered; patients should wait until the next \n\nscheduled dose is due. If a dose is missed or not taken at the usual time, then it should be taken as soon \nas the patient remembers unless more than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, in \n\nwhich case the patient should not take the missed dose. Patients should not take 2 doses at the same \n\ntime to make up for a missed dose.  \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\nDose modifications may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is \nnecessary, then the dose of glasdegib should be reduced to 50 mg taken orally once daily.  \n\n \n\nDose modification and management guidelines for specific adverse reactions are provided in Tables 1, \n\n2, 3 and 4. \n\n \nNo starting dose adjustments are required on the basis of patient age, race, gender, or body weight (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nAssessment and monitoring of laboratory and QT abnormalities  \n\nComplete blood counts, electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function should be assessed prior to the \ninitiation of Daurismo and at least once weekly for the first month. Electrolytes and renal function \n\nshould be monitored once monthly for the duration of therapy. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels \n\nshould be obtained prior to initiating Daurismo and as indicated clinically thereafter (e.g., if muscle \n\nsigns and symptoms are reported). Electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be monitored prior to the \n\ninitiation of Daurismo, approximately one week after initiation, and then once monthly for the next \n\ntwo months to assess for QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation. ECG should be repeated if \nabnormal. Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing ECG monitoring (see section 4.4). \n\nAbnormalities should be managed promptly.  \n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n4 \n\nTable 1.

If concomitant use \n\nof moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of Daurismo should be increased as \n\ntolerated as shown in Table 5. After the moderate CYP3A4 inducer has been discontinued for 7 days, \n\nthe Daurismo dose taken prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A4 inducer should be resumed (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nTable 5. Dose modification recommendations for Daurismo with concomitant use of moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nCurrent dose Adjusted dose \n\n100 mg orally once daily 200 mg orally once daily \n\n50 mg orally once daily 100 mg orally once daily \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment \n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. \n\nNo data are available in patients requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2). \n \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years of age) \n\nNo dose adjustment in elderly patients is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Daurismo in the paediatric population (< 18 years of age) have not been \nestablished. Daurismo should not be used in the paediatric population because there is no expected \n\nsignificant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \nDaurismo is for oral use. It may be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal toxicity \n \n\nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo-foetal developmental toxicity \n\nstudies, Daurismo can cause embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a \n\npregnant woman. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus (see section \n\n4.6).  \n\n \nDaurismo should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. The pregnancy status of female patients of childbearing potential should be verified \n\nprior to initiating treatment with Daurismo. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to \n\nalways use effective contraception during treatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days after the \n\nlast dose (see section 4.6). \n \n\nMales \n\nGlasdegib may be present in semen. Male patients with female partners should be advised of the \n\npotential risk of exposure through semen and to always use effective contraception, including a \n\ncondom (with spermicide, if available), even after vasectomy, to avoid exposure of a pregnant partner \nor a female partner of childbearing potential during treatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days \n\nafter the last dose (see section 4.6).  \n\n \n\nIf a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant, or suspects a pregnancy \n\nduring treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the last dose, they must inform their \nhealthcare provider immediately (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n8 \n\nBased on non-clinical safety findings, glasdegib has the potential to impair reproductive function in \n\nmales. Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation prior to initiating treatment with \n\nDaurismo (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation  \n\n \n\nIn a randomised study (Study 1) of patients with AML and high-risk MDS (myelodysplastic \n\nsyndrome) treated with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine vs. low-dose cytarabine alone, Grade 3/4 \n\nECG QT prolonged was reported in 3.5% of patients treated with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine \ncompared to 2.4% of the patients treated with low-dose cytarabine alone. \n\n \n\nElectrolytes should be assessed prior to initiation of Daurismo, at least once weekly for the first \n\nmonth, and then once monthly for the duration of therapy. Electrolyte abnormalities should be \n\ncorrected. \n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products should be assessed. For medicinal products that have known \n\nQT prolonging effects and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor potential, alternatives should be considered. \n\n \n\nECGs should be monitored prior to the initiation of Daurismo, approximately one week after initiation, \nand then once monthly for the next two months to assess for QTc prolongation. In patients with \n\ncongenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are \n\ntaking medicinal products with known QT prolonging effects, more frequent ECG monitoring is \n\nrecommended. ECG should be repeated if abnormal. Abnormalities should be managed promptly, and \n\ndose modifications should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \nMuscle-related adverse events \n\n \n\nIn Study 1, muscle spasms were observed in 22.6% of patients treated with Daurismo with low-dose \n\ncytarabine compared to 4.8% of the patients treated with low-dose cytarabine alone. \n\n \nAll patients starting therapy with Daurismo must be informed of the risk of muscle-related adverse \n\nevents. They must be instructed to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or \n\nweakness occurring during treatment with Daurismo or if symptoms persist after discontinuing \n\ntreatment. \n\n \nSerum CK levels should be obtained prior to initiating Daurismo and as clinically indicated thereafter \n\n(e.g., if muscle signs and symptoms are reported). Management of high-grade CK elevation based on \n\ncurrent standards of medical practice and following appropriate treatment guidelines is recommended. \n\nDose modification or management recommendations should be followed (see section 4.2).   \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n \n\nPatients with pre-existing renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction should be monitored \n\nclosely. Renal function should be assessed prior to initiation of therapy and at least once weekly for \n\nthe first month of therapy with Daurismo. Electrolytes and renal function should be monitored once \n\nmonthly for the duration of therapy (see section 4.2).  \n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\n'sodium-free'. \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib \n\n \n\nIn vitro, CYP3A4 is responsible for the majority of glasdegib depletion and contributed to the \n\nformation of other minor oxidative metabolites, with CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 playing a minor role in \n\nthe metabolism of glasdegib.  \n \n\nSubstances that may increase glasdegib plasma concentration \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nKetoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, dosed at 400 mg once daily for 7 days, increased the \n\nmean area under the curve (AUCinf) by ~2.4-fold and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 40% \nof a single 200 mg oral dose of glasdegib in healthy subjects. Caution should be used when \n\nadministering concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, \n\nitraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telaprevir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, ritonavir, \n\ngrapefruit or grapefruit juice ) as an increase in glasdegib plasma concentration may occur. If possible, \n\nalternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A4 inhibition potential is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \n\nGastric pH altering medicinal products \n\nCoadministration of a single 100 mg glasdegib dose under fasted condition with multiple doses of the \n\nproton-pump inhibitor (PPI), rabeprazole, resulted in no change in glasdegib plasma exposure (AUCinf \n\nratio: 100.6%). Concomitant administration of glasdegib with acid-reducing agents (including PPIs, \nH2-receptor antagonists, and locally acting antacids) is permitted. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may decrease glasdegib plasma concentration \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nRifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 11 days, \nreduced the mean AUCinf by 70% and Cmax by 35% of a single 100 mg dose of glasdegib in healthy \n\nsubjects. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, \n\nenzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided, as this is likely to decrease \n\nglasdegib plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nSimulations using physiologic-based pharmacokinetic modelling suggested that coadministration of \nefavirenz (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4) with glasdegib decreased glasdegib AUCinf by 55% and \n\nCmax by 25%. Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, \n\nmodafinil, nafcillin) should be avoided as they may also reduce glasdegib plasma concentrations (see \n\nsection 4.4). If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, the dose of \n\nDaurismo should be increased (see section 4.2). \n \n\nEffect of glasdegib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\nMedicinal products known to prolong QT interval \nGlasdegib may prolong QT interval. Therefore, the concomitant use of glasdegib with other medicinal \n\nproducts known to prolong QT interval or induce Torsades de Pointes should be carefully considered \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \n\nDrug transporters \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp, \n\ngastrointestinal [GI] tract) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, systemically and at the GI \n\ntract) mediated transport at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, narrow therapeutic index \n\nsubstrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin) or BCRP should be used with caution in combination with glasdegib.  \n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n10 \n\nIn vitro studies of transporter inhibition \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit (MATE)1 and MATE2K at \n\nclinically relevant concentrations. \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \nIf Daurismo is used in women of childbearing potential, they should be advised to avoid becoming \n\npregnant. The pregnancy status of female patients of childbearing potential should be verified prior \n\nto initiating treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking Daurismo, the patient should be \n\napprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n\n \nBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo-foetal developmental studies, \n\nDaurismo can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing \n\npotential who are receiving this medicinal product should always use effective contraception during \n\ntreatment with Daurismo and for at least 30 days after the last dose. If a female patient becomes \n\npregnant, or suspects a pregnancy, during treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the last \n\ndose, she must notify her healthcare provider immediately (see section 4.4). \n \n\nMales \n\nGlasdegib may be present in semen. Male patients should not donate semen during treatment with \n\nDaurismo and for at least 30 days after the last dose. Male patients with female partners should be \n\nadvised of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to always use effective contraception, \nincluding a condom (with spermicide, if available), even after a vasectomy, to avoid exposure of a \n\npregnant partner or a female partner of childbearing potential during treatment with Daurismo and for \n\nat least 30 days after the last dose. Male patients must inform their healthcare provider immediately if \n\ntheir female partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Daurismo or during the 30 days after the \n\nlast dose (see section 4.4). \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the use of Daurismo in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action and \n\nfindings in animal embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies, glasdegib can cause foetal harm \n\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Daurismo should not be used during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in humans to assess the effect of glasdegib on milk production, its \npresence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether glasdegib and its \n\nmetabolites are excreted in human milk. Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in \n\nbreast-feeding children from glasdegib, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with \n\nDaurismo and for at least one week after the last dose (see section 5.3).  \n\n \nFertility \n\n \n\nBased on non-clinical safety findings, glasdegib has the potential to impair reproductive function in \n\nmales. Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation prior to initiating treatment with \n\nDaurismo. Based on its mechanism of action, Daurismo may impair female fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nDaurismo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients \n\nexperiencing fatigue or other symptoms (e.g., muscle cramps, pain, nausea) affecting the ability to \n\nreact normally while taking Daurismo should exercise caution when driving or operating machines.  \n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n11 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\nThe overall safety profile of Daurismo is based on data from clinical studies, including Study 1 in \n\n84 patients with AML (N=75) and high-risk MDS (N=9). The median exposure to Daurismo across \n\nthe dataset was 75.5 days. \n\n \nThe most frequently (≥ 20%) reported adverse reactions in patients receiving Daurismo were anaemia \n\n(45.2%), haemorrhages (45.2%), febrile neutropenia (35.7%), nausea (35.7%), decreased appetite \n\n(33.3%), fatigue (30.9%), muscle spasms (30.9%), thrombocytopenia (30.9%), pyrexia (29.7%), \n\ndiarrhoea (28.5%), pneumonia (28.5%), dysgeusia (26.1%), oedema peripheral (26.1%), constipation \n\n(25.0%), abdominal pain (25.0%), rash (25.0%), dyspnoea (25.0%) vomiting (21.4%), and weight \ndecreased (20.2%).  \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose reductions in patients receiving \n\nDaurismo were muscle spasms (4.7%), fatigue (3.5%), febrile neutropenia (3.5%), anaemia (2.3%), \n\nthrombocytopenia (2.3%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (2.3%). The most frequently reported \n\nadverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in patients receiving Daurismo were \npneumonia (5.9%), febrile neutropenia (3.5%), and nausea (2.3%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 6 presents adverse reactions reported with Daurismo.

Grades 3 and 4 muscle spasms \n\nwere reported in 4.7% of patients in the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm compared to none in \nthe low-dose cytarabine alone arm. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nThere is no specific antidote for Daurismo. Management of Daurismo overdose should consist of \n\nsymptomatic treatment and ECG monitoring.   \n\nGlasdegib has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 640 mg/day. The dose-limiting \n\ntoxicities reported were nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, hypoxia, \npleural effusion and peripheral oedema. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX63 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nGlasdegib is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway that binds to Smoothened \n\n(SMO), a transmembrane protein, leading to decreased Glioma-Associated Oncogene (GLI) \n\ntranscription factor activity and downstream pathway signalling. Hh pathway signalling is required for \n\nmaintaining a leukaemic stem cell (LSC) population thus, glasdegib binding to and inhibiting SMO \n\nreduces GLI1 levels in AML cells and the leukaemic initiating potential of AML cells. Hh pathway \n\nsignalling is also implicated in resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In a preclinical model \n\nof AML, glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine inhibited increases in tumour size to a \n\ngreater extent than glasdegib or low-dose cytarabine alone. However, mechanism of action of the \n\ncombination is not fully understood. \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nHeart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with \n\nDaurismo at a supratherapeutic dose of > 270 mg. The effect of glasdegib administration on corrected \n\nQT interval was evaluated in a randomised, single-dose, double-blind, 4-way crossover, placebo- and \nopen-label moxifloxacin controlled study in 36 healthy subjects. At therapeutic plasma concentrations \n\n(achieved with a 150 mg single dose), the largest, placebo and baseline-adjusted corrected QT interval \n\nchange was 8.03 msec (90% CI: 5.85, 10.22 msec). At approximately twice the therapeutic \n\nconcentration (supratherapeutic, achieved with a 300 mg single dose), the QTc change was 13.43 msec \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n14 \n\n(95% CI: 11.25, 15.61 msec). Moxifloxacin (400 mg), used as a positive control, showed a mean QTc \n\nchange from baseline of 13.87 msec. None of the subjects met categorical criterion of absolute \n\ncorrected QT interval of ≥ 480 msec or increase from baseline in corrected QT interval ≥ 30 msec after \nreceiving any treatment. None of the ECG abnormalities were considered clinically significant or \n\nreported as adverse events by the investigator (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAdditionally, serial, triplicate ECGs were collected following a single and multiple dosing to evaluate \n\nthe effect of single agent glasdegib on the corrected QT interval in 70 patients with advanced cancer \n(5 mg to 640 mg once daily). Based on the exposure-response analysis, the estimated mean change \n\nfrom baseline in QTc was 5.30 msec (95% CI: 4.40, 6.24 msec) at the mean observed Cmax at steady \n\nstate following administration at the recommended 100 mg once daily dose of glasdegib. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nDaurismo in combination with low-dose cytarabine was investigated in a multicentre, randomised, \n\nopen-label Phase 2 study (Study 1) in a total of 132 patients, which included 116 patients with \n\npreviously untreated de novo or secondary AML who were not eligible to receive intensive \n\nchemotherapy as defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria: a) age > 75 years, b) severe \n\ncardiac disease, c) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, or \nd) baseline serum creatinine > 1.3 mg/dL. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Daurismo (100 mg \n\norally once daily) with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg SC twice daily on days 1 to 10 of the 28-day \n\ncycle) (n=78) or low-dose cytarabine alone (n=38) in 28-day cycles until disease progression or \n\nunacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified at randomisation by prognostic risk factor \n\n(good/intermediate or poor) based on cytogenetics. \n \n\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics are shown in Table 7. The two treatment arms \n\nwere generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Across \n\nboth arms, 40% of the AML patients had poor cytogenetic risk and 60% had good/intermediate \n\ncytogenetic risk. \n\n \n\nEfficacy was established by an improvement in overall survival (OS defined from the date of \n\nrandomisation to death of any cause) in the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm, compared to \n\nlow-dose cytarabine alone. After a median follow-up of approximately 20 months with 81% deaths \n\nobserved, the Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine arm was superior to low-dose cytarabine alone in \n\nAML patients (Figure 1). The efficacy results are shown in Table 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n15 \n\nTable 7.

Following repeat 100 mg once daily dosing to steady state, glasdegib median \n\nTmax ranged from approximately 1.3 hours to 1.8 hours. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n \n\nAfter oral administration of glasdegib tablets, the mean absolute bioavailability is 77.1% compared to \n\nintravenous administration. Administration of glasdegib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal resulted in \n\n16% lower exposure (AUCinf) compared to overnight fasting. The impact of food on the \n\npharmacokinetics of glasdegib is not considered clinically relevant. Glasdegib may be administered \nwith or without food. \n\n \n\nFollowing 100 mg once daily glasdegib dosing, the mean (coefficient of variation, %CV) of glasdegib \n\nCmax was 1,252 ng/mL (44%) and AUCtau was 17,210 ng•hr/mL (54%) in patients with cancer. \n\n \nDistribution \n\n \n\nGlasdegib is 91% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The mean (%CV) apparent volume of \n\ndistribution (Vz/F) was 188 (20) L following a single dose of 100 mg glasdegib in patients with \n\nhaematologic malignancies. \n\n \nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe primary metabolic pathways for glasdegib were comprised of N-demethylation, glucuronidation, \n\noxidation, and dehydrogenation. In plasma, the N-desmethyl and N-glucuronide metabolites of \n\nglasdegib accounted for 7.9% and 7.2% of the circulating radioactivity, respectively. Other \nmetabolites in plasma individually accounted for < 5% of circulating radioactivity. \n\n \n\nIn vitro interaction studies  \n\nIn vitro CYP inhibition and induction \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro studies indicated \n\nthat glasdegib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies of UGT inhibition  \nIn vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of uridine-diphosphate \n\nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A4, UGT1A6, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 at clinically relevant \n\nconcentrations. Glasdegib may have the potential to inhibit UGT1A1, and possibly UGT1A9, \n\nhowever, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are not expected. \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n18 \n\nIn vitro studies of organic anion and cation transporter inhibition  \n\nIn vitro studies indicated that glasdegib is not an inhibitor of organic anion transporting polypeptide \n\n(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter \n(OCT)2, at clinically relevant concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe mean ( SD) plasma half-life of glasdegib was 17.4  3.7 hours after a single dose of 100 mg \nglasdegib in patients. The geometric mean oral clearance after multiple dosing was 6.45 L/hr. \n\nFollowing oral administration of a 100 mg radiolabeled dose of glasdegib to healthy subjects, mean \n\n48.9% and 41.7% of the radioactivity dosed was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The \n\noverall mean mass balance of the dosed radioactivity in the excreta was 90.6%. Unchanged glasdegib \n\nwas the major component of human plasma, accounting for 69.4% of the total drug-related material. \n\nUnchanged glasdegib recovered in the urine and faeces accounted for 17.2% and 19.5% of the dose, \nrespectively.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe steady state systemic glasdegib exposure (Cmax and AUCtau) increased in a dose-proportional \nmanner over the dosing range of 5 mg to 600 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nData from a dedicated pharmacokinetic trial have shown that plasma exposures for total glasdegib \n\n(AUCinf and Cmax) were similar between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), whilst geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax values \n\nwere 24% and 42% lower, respectively, for subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \n\nClass C), compared to the normal hepatic function group. The glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound \n\nAUCinf) is increased by 18% and 16% in subjects with moderate and severe impairment, respectively, \n\nrelative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Peak glasdegib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) \n\nincreased by 1%, for moderate hepatic impairment and decreased by 11% for severe hepatic \n\nimpairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be \n\nclinically relevant.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nData from a dedicated pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal function \nimpairment indicate that total glasdegib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 105%, and 102 % with \n\nmoderate (30 mL/min ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min), and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, \n\nrespectively, relative to subjects with normal (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak glasdegib \n\nexposure (Cmax) increased by 37%, and 20% for subjects with moderate, and severe renal impairment, \n\nrespectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be \nclinically relevant. \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nIn patients assigned to treatment with Daurismo with low-dose cytarabine (n=88; Study 1), 97.7% of \n\nthe patients were aged 65 or older and 60.2% of the patients were aged 75 or older.  Study 1 did not \ninclude a sufficient number of patients younger than age 65 to determine differences in adverse \n\nreactions reported from patients older than 65. \n\n \n\nAge, race, gender, and body weight  \n\nThere are limited data in patients younger than 65 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analyses \n\nin adult patients (n=269) indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body \nweight on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib. \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n19 \n\n5.3 Pre-clinical safety data \n\n \n\nThe primary target organ findings following repeat oral administration of glasdegib in rats and dogs \nfor up to 26 and 39 weeks in duration, respectively, included the kidney (degeneration/necrosis) in rat \n\nand dog, the liver (necrosis/inflammation) in dog only, and the testis (degeneration), growing incisor \n\nteeth (necrosis/broken), growing bone (partial to full closure of epiphysis), and peripheral nerve \n\n(axonal degeneration) in rat only. Additional clinical observations of alopecia, weight loss, and muscle \n\ntremors/twitching, known class effects of SMO inhibitors, were observed in both species. These \nsystemic toxicities were generally dose-dependent and observed at exposures ranging from \n\napproximately < 0.03 to 8-times the clinically relevant exposure based on nonclinical to clinical \n\ncomparison of the observed unbound AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 100 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nComplete reversibility of toxicities to the kidney (degeneration/necrosis), peripheral nerve (axonal \ndegeneration), seminiferous tubule (testicular degeneration), and the clinical observations of muscle \n\ntremors/twitching was demonstrated following up to 16-week recovery, whereas partial recovery was \n\ndemonstrated in the liver (necrosis/inflammation). The observation of alopecia, bone and teeth effects, \n\nand testicular hypospermatogenesis did not recover. In addition, QTc prolongation was identified in \n\ntelemetered dogs at unbound Cmax exposures approximately 4-times the observed unbound Cmax \n\nexposure at the recommended clinical dose of 100 mg once daily. \n \n\nGlasdegib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not \n\nclastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Glasdegib was not \n\nclastogenic or aneugenic in the rat micronucleus assay. \n\n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with glasdegib. \n\n \n\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, findings observed in the male reproductive tract included \n\nadverse testicular changes with glasdegib at doses  50 mg/kg/day, and consisted of minimal to severe \n\nhypospermatogenesis characterised by partial to complete loss of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and \nspermatids and testicular degeneration. Hypospermatogenesis did not recover whereas testicular \n\ndegeneration did recover. The dose at which adverse testicular effects were observed in male rats was \n\nidentified as 50 mg/kg/day with corresponding systemic exposures that were approximately 8-times \n\nthose associated with the observed human exposure at the 100 mg once daily dose (based on unbound \n\nAUC in respective species). Safety margin for NOAEL (10 mg/kg/day) is 0.6, hence lower than \n\nclinically relevant. \n \n\nIn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits, glasdegib was severely \n\ntoxic to the conceptus as evidenced by complete resorption and/or abortion of foetuses, and \n\nteratogenic effects at lower dose levels. Teratogenic effects included craniofacial malformations, \n\nmalformed limbs, paws/digits, trunk and tail, dilation of brain, malpositioned/malformed eyes, \nmisshapen head, small tongue, absent palate, teeth and viscera, diaphragmatic hernia, oedema, \n\npersistent truncus arteriosus, heart defects, absent lung, absent trachea, rib and vertebral abnormalities, \n\nand malformed or absent structures in the appendicular skeleton (notably the long bones). Severe \n\ndevelopmental malformations were observed at maternal systemic exposures lower than the relevant \n\nhuman exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily. \n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Daurismo is and what it is used for \n\n \nDaurismo is a cancer medicine containing the active substance glasdegib. \n\n \n\nDaurismo is used with another cancer medicine, cytarabine, to treat adults newly diagnosed with a \n\nblood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).  \n\n \n\nHow Daurismo works \n \n\nIn AML, cancer cells called stem cells constantly make new leukaemic cancer cells. Daurismo works \n\nby blocking a key process in these stem cells, called the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This reduces their \n\nability to make new cancer cells. By blocking the Hh pathway, Daurismo can also make cancer cells \n\nmore sensitive to a cancer medicine, cytarabine, used to treat AML. Combining Daurismo with the \n\nmedicine cytarabine may increase how long patients are likely to live by decreasing growth of the \n\ncancer and possibly by increasing cancer cell death.  \n\n \nIf you have any questions about how Daurismo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \n\nyou, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.
