This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPOTELIGEO 4 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 20 mg of mogamulizumab in 5 mL, corresponding to 4 mg/mL. \n \nMogamulizumab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPOTELIGEO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary \nsyndrome (SS) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer, and \nshould only be administered by healthcare professionals in an environment where resuscitation \nequipment is available.  \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg/kg mogamulizumab administered as an intravenous infusion over at \nleast 60 minutes. Administration is weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the first 28-day cycle, followed \nby infusions every two weeks on Days 1 and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n \nPOTELIGEO should be administered within 2 days of the scheduled day. If a dose is missed by more \nthan 2 days, the next dose should be administered as soon as possible, after which the dosing schedule \nshould be resumed with doses given based on the new scheduled days. \n \nPre-medication with anti-pyretic and anti-histamine is recommended for the first POTELIGEO \ninfusion. If an infusion reaction occurs, administer pre-medication for subsequent POTELIGEO \ninfusions.  \n \nDose modification \nDermatologic reactions \nPatients receiving mogamulizumab have experienced drug rash (drug eruption), some of which were \nsevere and/or serious. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n• In the event of a rash (drug related) with severity of Grade 2 or 3 (moderate or severe), \ntreatment with mogamulizumab must be interrupted and the rash should be treated appropriately \nuntil rash improves to Grade 1 or less (mild severity), at which time mogamulizumab treatment \nmay be resumed. \n\n• POTELIGEO should be permanently discontinued for a life-threatening (Grade 4) rash (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions \n• The infusion of POTELIGEO should be temporarily interrupted for mild to severe (Grades 1-3) \n\ninfusion-related reactions and symptoms treated. The infusion rate should be reduced by at least \n50% when re-starting the infusion after symptoms resolve. If reaction recurs, discontinuing the \ninfusion should be considered (see section 4.4). \n\n• POTELIGEO should be permanently discontinued for a life-threatening (Grade 4) \ninfusion-related reaction (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of POTELIGEO in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \nmild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \nmild or moderate hepatic impairment. POTELIGEO has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nPOTELIGEO is for intravenous use. It should be administered by intravenous infusion only, over at \nleast 60 minutes. See above recommendations in case of infusion-related reaction. \n \nFor instructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDermatologic reactions \nPatients receiving mogamulizumab have experienced drug rash (drug eruption), some of which were \nsevere and/or serious.  \n \nWhen mogamulizumab has been administered to patients with T-cell lymphomas other than MF or SS, \nserious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN), have been reported in less than 1% of patients during clinical trials, and also reported during \nthe post-marketing period; some of these cases were reported with fatal outcomes. Patients should be \nclosely monitored for symptoms or signs that suggest SJS or TEN. If they occur, POTELIGEO should \nbe interrupted and treatment should not restart unless SJS or TEN is ruled out and cutaneous reaction \nhas resolved to Grade 1 or less. If SJS/TEN occur, appropriate medical therapy should be \nadministered. See section 4.2 for dose modification information. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions  \nAcute infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed in patients treated with mogamulizumab. \nThe IRRs were mostly mild or moderate in severity, although there have been a few reports of severe \nreactions (Grade 3). The majority of IRRs occur during or shortly after the first infusion (all within \n24 hours of administration), with the incidence decreasing over subsequent treatments.  \n \nPatients should be carefully monitored during and after infusion. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, \nadministration of mogamulizumab should be immediately and permanently discontinued and \nappropriate medical therapy should be administered. \n \nIf an IRR occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management instituted. \nThe infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after symptom resolution. See section 4.2 for pre-\nmedication and dose modification information. \n \nInfections \nSubjects with MF or SS treated with mogamulizumab are at increased risk of serious infection and/or \nviral reactivation. The combination of mogamulizumab with systemic immune modulating medicinal \nproducts or with other licensed therapies for MF or SS has not been studied and is, therefore, not \nrecommended, especially in consideration of the risk of severe infections in patients treated with \nmogamulizumab. Topical steroids or low doses of systemic corticosteroids may be used during \ntreatment with mogamulizumab; however, the risk of serious infection and/or viral reactivation may be \nhigher in case of concomitant administration with systemic immunosuppressive agents. Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly. \n \nPatients should be tested for hepatitis B infection before initiating treatment with mogamulizumab. For \npatients who test positive for current/previous hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with \nexpertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended for advice concerning appropriate measures \nagainst hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nComplications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after mogamulizumab  \nComplications, including severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), have been reported in patients \nwith T-cell lymphomas other than MF or SS who received allogeneic HSCT after mogamulizumab.  \n \nA higher risk of transplant complications has been reported if mogamulizumab is given within a short \ntime frame (approximately 50 days) before HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of \ntransplant-related complications. \n \nThe safety of treatment with mogamulizumab after autologous or allogeneic HSCT has not been \nstudied. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome  \nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been observed in patients receiving mogamulizumab. TLS was \nobserved most frequently during the first month of treatment. Patients with rapidly proliferating \ntumour and high tumour burden are at risk of TLS. Patients should be monitored closely by \nappropriate laboratory and clinical tests for electrolyte status, hydration and renal function, particularly \nin the first month of treatment, and managed according to best medical practice. Management of TLS \nmay include aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, anti-hyperuricaemic \ntherapy, and supportive care. \n \nCardiac disorders \nOne case of acute myocardial infarction has been observed in a clinical trial patient with MF / SS \nreceiving mogamulizumab. In clinical trial patients with other T-cell lymphomas there have been \nreports of stress cardiomyopathy (one case) and acute myocardial infarction (one case). The subjects \nhad a medical history including various risk factors. Patients who have risk factors associated with \ncardiac disease should be monitored and appropriate precautions taken. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nLarge cell transformation (LCT) \nThere are limited data available on patients with LCT. \n \nOther \nMogamulizumab should not be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, by rapid intravenous \nadministration, or as an intravenous bolus. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium \nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential and males of reproductive potential should use effective \ncontraception during treatment with POTELIGEO and for at least 6 months after treatment.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of mogamulizumab in pregnant women. Although mogamulizumab \ncrosses the placental barrier in cynomolgous monkey, apart from the pharmacological effect in \nfoetuses, animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nmogamulizumab during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether mogamulizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be \nexcreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations \nsoon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short \nperiod. Afterwards POTELIGEO could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed. \n \nFertility \nThere are no clinical data available on the effect of mogamulizumab on human fertility. No specific \nstudies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of mogamulizumab on fertility. No \nadverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies \nin cynomolgus monkeys (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMogamulizumab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue may occur \nfollowing administration of mogamulizumab (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, pyrexia, infusion related \nreaction and cellulitis.  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were infusion-related reaction and rash (drug \neruption); most of these reactions were non-serious and Grades 1 or 2.  \n \nSevere adverse reactions included Grade 4 respiratory failure (1.1%) and Grade 5 reactions were \npolymyositis and sepsis (0.5% each). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nThe adverse reactions are presented by system organ class and frequency categories, defined using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse drug reactions occurring in patients receiving POTELIGEO (N=184) \nSystem organ class (SOC) Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Common Anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia \nEndocrine disorders Common Hypothyroidism \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common \nConstipation, diarrhoea, nausea, \nstomatitis \n\nCommon Vomiting \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions Very common Fatigue, oedema peripheral, pyrexia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Hepatitis acute, hepatitis \n\nInfections and infestations Very common Infections\na \n\nCommon Upper respiratory tract infection \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications Very common Infusion related reaction \n\nInvestigations Common \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased, \naspartate aminotransferase increased, \nblood alkaline phosphatase increased, \nlymphocyte count decreased \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Uncommon Tumour lysis syndrome \nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very common Drug eruption (including skin rash) \na Folliculitis, Cellulitis, Candidiasis, Pneumonia, Sepsis, Skin infection, Otitis externa, Herpes zoster, \nStaphylococcal skin infection, Urinary tract infection, Herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDermatologic reactions \nPatients receiving POTELIGEO have experienced drug rash (drug eruption), some of which were \nsevere and/or serious. The majority of treatment-related dermatologic reactions were Grade 1 or 2, \nwith Grade ≥3 drug rash occurring in 4.3% of patients. No trend in latency to event onset was \nidentified for drug eruptions and rashes; both early and late-onset events occurred. \n \nInfusion-related reactions  \nInfusion-related reactions have been observed in 33% of patients treated with POTELIGEO. The \nmajority of treatment-related infusion-related reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred during or \nshortly after the first infusion. Severe reactions (Grade 3) were experienced by 4% of patients.  \n \nThe incidence of infusion related reactions was highest after the first infusion (28.8% of subjects), \nreducing to ≤ 3.8% of subjects after two or more infusions.  \n \nInfusion interruptions occurred in approximately 6% of patients, most of which (approximately 90%) \noccurred within the first cycle of treatment with mogamulizumab.  \n \nLess than 1% of patients treated in Study 0761-010 discontinued treatment due to infusion-related \nreactions. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSerious infections \nPatients with MF or SS are at increased risk of serious infection due to the disruption of dermal \nintegrity caused by cutaneous disease, as well as the immunosuppressive effects of extracutaneous \ndisease, and treatment with mogamulizumab may increase that risk. Serious infections, including \nsepsis, pneumonia and skin infections, were experienced by 14.3% of subjects receiving \nmogamulizumab. The latency to event onset following the first dose varied considerably. The majority \nof patients recovered from infection. In the clinical trial (0761-010), there were 2 reports of respiratory \nfailure with fatal outcome in patients with severe pneumonia occurring more than 9 months after \nstarting treatment with mogamulizumab. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. A small percentage of \npatients receiving POTELIGEO tested positive for treatment emergent (treatment induced or treatment \nboosted) anti mogamulizumab antibodies. There were no positive neutralising antibody responses. \n \nSafety post last dose \nOf the 320 subjects exposed to mogamulizumab in Study 0761-010, 21 (6.6%), experienced at least \none serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) that occurred within 90 days from the date of last study \ndrug administration.  \n \nOf these, SADRs that were reported in more than one patient were coded under the SOCs Infections \nand infestations (7 [2.2%] patients), General disorders and administration site conditions (5 [1.6%] \npatients), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (4 [1.3%] patients), Musculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders (3 [0.9%] patients), Hepatobiliary disorders (2 [0.6%] patients), and Injury, \npoisoning and procedural complications (2 [0.6%] patients). All remaining SOCs reported SADRs in \none patient (0.3%). \n \nThe safety profile observed in the 90 days following the last dose of mogamulizumab is consistent \nwith the safety profile observed during the study treatment period. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety profile in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) was generally consistent with that of adult patients, \nexcept for dermatologic reactions and infusion related reactions which were seen more often in older \nsubjects. \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no information on overdose with mogamulizumab. In case of overdose, the patient, including \ntheir vital signs, should be closely monitored (for at least 1 hour) and supportive treatment should be \nadministered if required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, monoclonal antibodies \nATC code: L01XC25 \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nMechanism of action \nMogamulizumab is a defucosylated, humanised IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin that selectively binds to \nCCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor for CC chemokines that is involved in the trafficking of \nlymphocytes to various organs including the skin, resulting in depletion of the target cells. CCR4 is \nexpressed on the surface of some cancer cells including T cell malignancies, such as MF and SS in \nwhich CCR4 expression is inherent. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy of mogamulizumab in the treatment of patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary \nsyndrome (SS) was established in a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, study (0761-010) of 372 adult \npatients randomised 1:1 to treatment with either mogamulizumab or vorinostat. Each arm enrolled \n186 patients. Mogamulizumab infusion was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg once weekly for the \nfirst 28-day cycle (on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22), and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. \nVorinostat was administered at a starting dose of 400 mg orally, once daily beginning on day 1 for 28-\nday cycles. Vorinostat patients with disease progression or unacceptable toxicities were permitted to \ncross over to mogamulizumab therapy. Crossover patients received up to 46 months of \nmogamulizumab therapy, as of December 2016 data cut. Treatment with mogamulizumab continued \nuntil disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune \ndiseases, central nervous system metastasis, and medical conditions that required systemic \ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medicinal products, or an active infection requiring \ntherapy, including HIV, or hepatitis B or C. Patients with ECOG performance status ≥2 were also \nexcluded. At study baseline, 38% had stage IB-II disease, 10% stage III, 52% stage IV. This study \nincluded patients regardless of their baseline level of CCR4 expression in skin biopsy. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment \nusing a global composite response criteria that took into account all potentially affected disease \ncompartments (skin, blood, lymph nodes and viscera). Response in skin and blood was evaluated \nevery 4 weeks. Response in lymph nodes and viscera was evaluated at 4 weeks, then every 8 weeks in \nthe first year, and then every 16 weeks thereafter. \n \nAll patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (MF), 56.5%, 53.2%, or \nSézary Syndrome (SS), 43.5%, 46.8%, in the mogamulizumab and vorinostat groups, respectively, and \nhad received at least one prior systemic therapy. The most common prior systemic therapies used by \nsubjects in Europe were bexarotene (70%), interferon (59%), methotrexate (49%), extracorporeal \nphotopheresis (ECP) (31%) and gemcitabine/gemcitabine regimens (28%). \n \nThe median duration of exposure with mogamulizumab was 5.6 months (range: <1 to 45.3 months). \n56% of patients received mogamulizumab for at least 6 cycles, and 25% of patients received \nmogamulizumab for at least 12 cycles. \n \nPatients were a median age of 64 years at the time of screening (range 25 to 101 years), 49.5% were \n65 years or older, and 58.1% were male. \n \nCCR4 expression was assessed retrospectively on pretreatment skin biopsies (formalin fixed paraffin \nembedded) using immunohistochemistry. In the mogamulizumab arm, baseline CCR4 expression \nlevels were available in 75% of patients (N=140). CCR4 was detected on ≥1% of lymphocytes in \n100% of patients, and 96% (134/140) had CCR4 detected on ≥10% of skin lymphocytes.  \n \nOf the patients randomised to vorinostat, 136 patients (73.1%) crossed over to mogamulizumab during \nthe study. Reasons for crossover to mogamulizumab were disease progression (109 patients) and \ntreatment intolerance (27 patients). The number of infusions of mogamulizumab administered to \ncrossover patients ranged from 1 to 94 (up to 46 months of treatment) as of the December 2016 \ndatacut.  \n \nAt 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the start of randomised treatment, the percent of subjects alive \nwithout disease progression was higher for mogamulizumab (55.3%, 38.3%, 28.0%, and 14.1%, \nrespectively) compared to vorinostat (28.8%, 15.3%, 7.2%, and 7.2%, respectively). Median PFS for \n\n\n\n9 \n\nthe mogamulizumab group was 7.70 months (95% CI: 5.67, 10.33) and 3.10 months (95% CI: 2.87, \n4.07) for the vorinostat group with resultant hazard ration of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.69), p<0.0001 (2-\nsided, stratified log rank test).  \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1: Plot of Kaplan-Meier curve of progression-free survival by investigator’s assessment \n(ITT) population \n\n \n \nKey secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), ORR after crossover, duration of response \n(DOR), and changes from baseline of the Skindex-29 Symptoms and Functional Scales, and \nFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Physical and Functional Well-being \ndomains. \n \nOverall response was reported as a composite score from measures in each compartment, and a \nresponse had to be demonstrated at two successive overall disease assessments (at least 8 weeks apart \nduring the first year and 16 weeks apart thereafter) in order to be confirmed. Patients were included in \nthe analysis for a specific compartment if they had presence of disease in that compartment at \nbaseline, or had any post-baseline response assessment for that compartment. \n \nTable 2 summarises ORR and DOR, and response by compartment. The study demonstrated \nstatistically significant improvements in ORR and response by compartment in the blood, skin, and \nlymph nodes as compared to vorinostat. Response in the viscera could not be evaluated due to limited \nefficacy data in subjects with visceral involvement; the benefit-risk of mogamulizumab in subjects \nwith visceral involvement is currently undetermined due to lack of data. \n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 2: Response during randomised treatment period in study 0761-010 (intent-to-treat) \n Mogamulizumab \n\nN=186  \nVorinostat \n\nN=186 \nOverall response rate  \n(confirmed CR + PR, %)  \n\n28.0  4.8 \n\n95% CI (21.6, 35.0)  (2.2, 9.0)  \nP-valuea <.0001 \n\nDuration of response (months)   \nMedian (95% CI) 14.1 (9.4, 19.2)  9.13 (4.7,-) \nResponse by compartment   \nBlood n=124  n=125 \n\nResponse rate (confirmed CR + PR, %) 66.9 18.4  \n95% CI (57.9, 75.1)   (12.0, 26.3) \n\nP-valuea <0.0001 \nSkin n=186  n=186 \n\nOverall response rate (confirmed CR + PR, %) 41.9  15.6 \n95% CI (34.8, 49.4)   (10.7, 21.6) \n\nP-valuea <.0001 \nLymph nodes n=136  n=133 \n\nOverall response rate (confirmed CR + PR, %) 15.4  3.8 \n95% CI (9.8, 22.6)   (1.2, 8.6) \n\nP-valuea 0.0008 \nViscera n=6 n=4 \n\nOverall response rate (confirmed CR + PR, %) 0 0 \n95% CI (0.0, 45.9)   (0.0, 60.2) \n\nNote: Overall response rate is based on Global Composite Response score. \na: P-value was obtained from Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for disease type, disease stage, and region. \nCI=confidence interval; CR=complete response; PR=partial response \n \nTreatment with mogamulizumab resulted in 8 confirmed complete responses (complete clearing of all \naffected compartments) compared with 0 patients on vorinostat: 4 of these 8 patients were initially \nrandomized to mogamulizumab and 4 had crossed over to mogamulizumab during the study. Forty-\none of the 136 cross-over patients (30.1%) responded with either partial or complete response with \nmogamulizumab. \n \nThere are limited efficacy data in patients with low (<10%) CCR4 expression in the skin. In Study \n0761-010 there were 10/290 evaluable patients with CCR4 expression <10%, of which 6 were \nrandomised to mogamulizumab, and 4 were randomised to vorinostat and subsequently crossed over to \nmogamulizumab. No confirmed responses were observed in these 10 subjects with low (<10%) CCR4 \nexpression. Compartmental responses were seen in 3 of 10 evaluable subjects treated with \nmogamulizumab in the randomised or cross over phase. \n \nPatients with stage IB/II disease treated with mogamulizumab had confirmed ORR of 17.6% \ncompared to 8.3% for vorinostat, and compartment level (blood, skin, lymph node) response rates that \nwere higher than those for vorinostat treated patients (Table 3). Overall, the median period of \nprogression free survival for stage IB/II subjects treated with mogamulizumab was 4.7 months \ncompared to 3.9 months for vorinostat-treated patients (Table 4).  In patients with stage IB/II disease, \ngiven the limited number of subjects with a response and immaturity of the data, no conclusion on \nduration of response can be made. \n \nTime to compartment level response in Stage IB/II patients was approximately 3 months, which is \nconsistent with time to response for the ITT population overall (approximately 3 months). If a \ncompartment level response or overall response is not observed after 3 months of treatment, \ndiscontinuation of treatment should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 3: Overall and Compartmental Response Rate in Early Disease Stages  \nMogamulizumab Vorinostat Risk Diff (M vs. V) \n\nDisease stage IB/II N=68 N=72  \nOverall response rate (ORR), n (%) 12 (17.6) 6 (8.3) 9.3 \nCompartment:    \nBlood (n) 17 23  \n Response Rate (n, %) 8 (47.1) 4 (17.4) 29.7 \n  95% CIa (23.0, 72.2) (5.0, 38.8) (-2.2, 57.1) \nSkin (n) 68 72  \n Response Rate (n, %) 19 (27.9) 14 (19.4) 8.5 \n  95% CIa (17.7, 40.1) (11.1, 38.8) (-8.3, 24.9) \nNodal (n) 41 40  \n Response Rate (n, %) 4 (9.8) 1 (2.5) 7.3 \n  95% CIa (2.7, 23.1) (0.1, 13.2) (-14.3, 28.6) \n\nM=mogamulizumab.

See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of mogamulizumab was evaluated in adult patients with T-cell leukaemia-\nlymphoma (ATL) and CTCL over a dose range of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg administered as multiple doses of \nmogamulizumab every week or every 2 weeks, and included the recommended 1.0 mg/kg dose and \nregimen (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for the first 28-day cycle and on Days 1 and 15 for subsequent 28-day \ncycles). The population PK analysis included 444 patients receiving mogamulizumab in six clinical \ntrials. The exposure to mogamulizumab increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 0.1 \nto 1.0 mg/kg. \n \nAbsorption \nMogamulizumab is dosed via intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely \nbioavailable. \n \nDistribution \nBased on a population PK analysis, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] central \nvolume of distribution (Vc) was 3.57 L (20.1%). \n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolic pathway of mogamulizumab has not been characterised. Mogamulizumab is expected \nto be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as \nendogenous IgG. \n \nElimination \nBased on a population PK analysis, the geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance \n(CL) is 12.0 mL/h (83.7%) and geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) is 17 days (65.5%). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nLinearity and accumulation \nMogamulizumab exhibits linear PK from the dose in a dose range of 0.01 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg. Based on \na population PK analysis, the steady-state concentrations of mogamulizumab were reached after \n12 weeks of repeated dosing when administered using the recommended regimen, and systemic \naccumulation was 1.7-fold. On a power model analysis, no deviation from dose proportionality was \nevident. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on the clearance of mogamulizumab was evaluated by a population PK \nanalysis in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CrCL] between 60 and 89; n= 157), moderate \n(CrCL between 59 and 30; n= 80), or severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min; n= 2). No \nclinically important differences in the clearance of mogamulizumab were found between patients with \nmild to severe renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance of mogamulizumab was evaluated by a population \nPK analysis in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the \nupper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or TB less than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any \nAST; n= 80) or moderate (TB greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST; n=3) hepatic impairment. \nNo clinically important differences in the clearance of mogamulizumab were found between patients \nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. Mogamulizumab \nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (TB greater than 3 times ULN and any \nAST). \n \nOther special populations \nThe effects of various covariates on the PK s of mogamulizumab were assessed in population PK \nanalyses. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of mogamulizumab: age \n(range: 22 to 101 years), sex, ethnicity (other than Japanese, limited data are available in other ethnic \npopulations), renal impairment, mild or moderate hepatic impairment, disease subtype (mycosis \nfungoides (MF) or Sézary Syndrome (SS)), degree of CCR4 expression or ECOG status, although it \nshould be noted that patients with ECOG PS ≥2 were excluded from the clinical trials. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \nEfficacy \nExposure-Response analysis indicated that efficacy was not correlated with mogamulizumab exposure \nin the pivotal study. Efficacy, as measured by improvement in PFS based on investigator assessment, \nwas not associated with increasing mogamulizumab exposure.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose \ntoxicity. Carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with mogamulizumab. No \nspecific studies have been conducted to evaluate potential effects on fertility. \n \nNo mogamulizumab-related toxic effects in the male and female reproductive organs were observed in \nrepeat-dose toxicology studies in sexually mature monkeys up to 26 weeks. \n \nIn an animal reproductive and developmental toxicity study, administration of mogamulizumab to \npregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the start of organogenesis through delivery did not show a \npotential for embryo-foetal lethality, teratogenicity, or foetal growth retardation. In general, IgG \nmolecules are known to cross the placental barrier and mogamulizumab concentrations in foetus \nplasma were detected.  Pharmacological activity of mogamulizumab was noted in foetuses as was \nevident from a decrease in CCR4 expressing lymphocytes. \n \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.

What POTELIGEO is and what it is used for \n \nPOTELIGEO contains the active substance mogamulizumab, which belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled monoclonal antibodies. Mogamulizumab targets cancer cells which are then destroyed by the \nimmune system (the body’s defence). \n \nThis medicine is used to treat adults with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome, which are types of \ncancers called cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.  The medicine is for use in patients who have received at \nleast one medicine given by mouth or by injection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use POTELIGEO \n \nDo not use POTELIGEO if you are: \n- allergic to mogamulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using POTELIGEO if you: \n- ever had a severe skin reaction with this medicine. \n- ever had an infusion reaction with this medicine (possible symptoms of an infusion reaction are \n\nlisted in section 4). \n- have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or hepatitis B or \n\nC infection, or other on-going infections.  \n- have had or plan to have a stem cell transplant, either using your own cells or a donor’s.  \n- have had tumour lysis syndrome (a complication involving the destruction of cancer cells) after \n\na previous treatment. \n- have heart problems. \n \nTell the person giving you the infusion or get medical help straight away if you experience a \nreaction during or after any POTELIGEO infusion. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the serious side effects listed in Section 4 \nafter starting POTELIGEO treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe effects of POTELIGEO in pregnancy and breast-feeding are not known. Due to the mechanism of \naction of the medicine, it may harm your baby if it is administered when you are pregnant or \nbreast- feeding. \n \nIf you can get pregnant, you will need to use effective contraception during and for at least six months \nafter receiving this treatment. If you are breast-feeding, you should discuss with your doctor whether \nyou can breast-feed during or after treatment with POTELIGEO. \n \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or \nare planning to have a baby.  \n \nMen \nYou will need to use effective contraception during and for at least six months after receiving this \ntreatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nPOTELIGEO is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, the medicine can \ncause tiredness in some people, so take particular care when driving and using machines until you are \ncertain that this medicine does not affect you.  \n \nPOTELIGEO contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How POTELIGEO is given \n \nThe amount of POTELIGEO you will receive is calculated by your doctor based on your body weight.  \nThe recommended dose is 1mg POTELIGEO for each kg of body weight. \n \nPOTELIGEO will be given to you through a vein (intravenous infusion) over at least 60 minutes. To \nstart with, the infusions will be given once a week for the first 5 doses, then once every 2 weeks. \nTreatment should be continued unless you get serious side effects or the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma \nstarts to get worse.  \n \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \n \nTell your doctor or nurse or get medical help immediately if you have any of the following \nsymptoms after starting POTELIGEO:  \n- chills, nausea or vomiting, headache, wheezing, itching, flushing, rash, dizziness or feeling \n\nfaint, difficulty breathing and fever, which may be signs of an infusion reaction. If this happens, \nthe infusion may need to be stopped and you may require additional treatment. When the \nsymptoms go away, POTELIGEO can normally continue to be given, but more slowly. Your \ndoctor may stop POTELIGEO treatment if your reaction is severe.  \n\n- signs of infection, which may include a fever, sweats or chills, flu-like symptoms, sore throat or \ndifficulty swallowing, cough, shortness of breath, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea \nand feeling very unwell.  \n\n- skin pain, itching, skin blisters, skin rash or sore mouth, which are possible signs that you may \nbe developing a severe skin reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis.  \n\n- chest pain, shortness of breath, fast or slow heartbeat, sweating, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, \nweakness, feeling faint and feeling unwell.

The destruction of cancer cells \nand the body’s reaction to it can very occasionally lead to a problem called tumour lysis \nsyndrome. \n\n- if you go on to have a stem cell transplant, it is possible that you could then develop \ncomplications (graft versus host disease) that are difficult to manage. Symptoms may include \nskin rashes or blistering, nausea or diarrhoea that doesn’t go away, stomach pain or vomiting, \njoint pain or stiffness, dry or irritated eyes or blurred vision, mouth sores, irritation or pain, a \ncough that does not go away or difficulty breathing, sensitive genitals, jaundice (turning \nyellow), dark urine, and any swelling.  \n\n \nOther side effects \n \nTalk to your doctor if you get any other side effects.
