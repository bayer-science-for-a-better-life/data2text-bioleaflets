NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nArepanrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus, inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A) 3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-Î±-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial. See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipients: the vaccine contains 5 micrograms thiomersal \n \nFor a full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a translucent to off white opalescent suspension, which may sediment slightly. \nThe emulsion is a whitish homogeneous liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nPandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account available data from: \n \nâ¢ Ongoing clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose of Arepanrix (H1N1) \nâ¢ Clinical studies in healthy subjects (including elderly subjects) who received two doses of a \n\nversion of Arepanrix containing 3.75 Âµg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  3 \n\nAnd also from: \n \nâ¢ On-going clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose or two doses of an \n\nAS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process \nâ¢ Clinical studies in healthy subjects who received two doses of an AS03-containing vaccine \n\ncontaining HA from H5N1 manufactured using a different process. \n \nIn some age groups there are limited clinical study data (adults aged 60-79 years and children aged 10 \nto 17 years), very limited clinical study data (adults aged 80 years and older, children aged 6 months to \n9 years) or no data (children aged less than 6 months) with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H5N1 or from H1N1v manufactured using a different process as detailed in sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.1. \n \nAdults aged 18-60 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Arepanrix (H1N1) in clinical \nstudies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand the second dose. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine \ncontaining HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that a \nsingle dose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand the second dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 10-17 years \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine \ncontaining HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that \ndosing may be in accordance with the recommendations for adults.   \n \nChildren aged from 6 months to 9 years \nOne dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date.  \nPreliminary immunogenicity data obtained with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v manufactured using a different process in a limited number of children aged 6-35 months \nshow that there is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval \nof three weeks. \n \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 \nand 5.1. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Arepanrix should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Arepanrix (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine. If \nvaccination is considered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available \nin case of need. \n \nSee section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nArepanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Arepanrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need \nto assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThere are no safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with Arepanrix or with an \nAS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in \nchildren aged less than 6 months. There are limited data available from a clinical study with an AS03-\ncontaining vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy \nchildren aged from 10 to 17 years, very limited data with the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy children aged from 6 to 35 months and \nlimited data from a study with a version of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 \nmanufactured using a different process in children aged from 3 to 9 years. \n \nVery limited data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process in children aged 6 to 35 months (N=51) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of \nthe adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses indicate an increase in the rates of injection \nsite reactions and general symptoms (see section 4.8).  In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature \nâ¥38Â°C) may increase considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and \nmeasures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are \nrecommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) after each vaccination. \n \nThere are limited data available from clinical studies with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H1N1v manufactured using a different process in adults aged over 60 years and very limited data \nin adults aged over 80 years.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  5 \n\nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Arepanrix with \nother H1N1 pandemic vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData obtained on co-administration of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v \nmanufactured using a different process with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a \nsplit virion vaccine) in healthy adults aged over 60 years did not suggest any significant interference in \nthe immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v. The immune \nresponse to Fluarix was satisfactory.   Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local \nor systemic reactions compared to administration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v alone.  \nTherefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nData obtained on the administration of a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a split \nvirion vaccine) three weeks before a dose of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v \nmanufactured using a different process in healthy adults over 60 years of age, did not suggest any \nsignificant interference in the immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v. Therefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be administered three weeks after the \nadministration of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with \nanother vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are currently no data available on the use of Arepanrix in pregnancy.

Control groups included ferrets \nimmunized with adjuvant alone and non-adjuvanted vaccine (7.5 micrograms HA). Ferrets immunized \nwith the non adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine were not protected from death and showed similar \nlung viral loads and degree of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract as those exhibited by ferrets \nimmunized with the adjuvant alone. Conversely the combination of a range of doses of H5N1 antigen \nwith AS03 adjuvant was able to protect against mortality and to reduce lung virus loads and viral \nshedding after intra-tracheal challenge with a homologous wild type H5N1 virus.  Serological testing \nindicated a direct correlation between vaccines induced HI and neutralising antibody titres in protected \nanimals compared to antigen and adjuvant controls. \n \n- Challenge with a heterologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Hong Kong/156/97) \n\nIn this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with \nvaccine candidate containing four different doses of H5N1 antigen (3.75, 1.5, 0.6 and 0.24 Âµg of HA \nantigen) adjuvanted with half dose of AS03. In addition, one group of six ferrets were immunized with \nvaccine candidate containing 3.75 Âµg H5N1 + full dose of AS03 and one control group included \nferrets immunized with non-adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 micrograms HA). The results of this \nheterologous challenge study indicate 80.7%-100% protection in all adjuvanted candidate vaccines \ncompared to 43% protection with the non adjuvanted vaccine, showing the benefit of AS03 \nadjuvantation. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  15 \n\nNon-clinical data obtained with a version of Arepanrix containing 3.75 Âµg HA derived from \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal \nand postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for \n2. Before you receive Arepanrix \n3. How Arepanrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Arepanrix \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for \n \nArepanrix is a vaccine against a pandemic influenza (flu).  \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but may be more severe. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the bodyâs natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Arepanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. Before you are given Arepanrix \n \nYou should not receive Arepanrix: \n \nâ¢ if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nArepanrix (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be \npresent in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or \nsodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be \nappropriate for you to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is \nimmediately available in case of an allergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nTake special care with Arepanrix: \n \nâ¢ if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\nhttp://www.emea.europa.eu/\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  35 \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, \nformaldehyde  or to sodium deoxycholate. (see section 6. Further information). \n\nâ¢ if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38Â°C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with Arepanrix. \n\nâ¢ if you have a poor immune response (as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer), \n\nâ¢ if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Arepanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Arepanrix. \n\nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nIf your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after \nthe second dose, especially temperature over 38Â°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures \nto lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each \ndose are recommended.  \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. \n \nAreapanrix can be given at the same time as seasonal influenza vaccines that do not contain an \nadjuvant. \n \nPersons who have received a seasonal influenza vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant may receive \nArepanrix after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nThere is no information on administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines and no information on \nadministration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process with any other vaccines than non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. However, if \nthis cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.  In such cases, you should \nbe aware that the side effects may be more intense.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant. You should \ndiscuss with your doctor whether you should receive Arepanrix. \nThe vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. âPossible side effectsâ may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Arepanrix \nThis vaccine contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an \nallergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium \n(39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  36 \n\n3. How Arepanrix is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \n \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).  \n \nAdults including the elderly and children from the age of 10 years onwards: \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given \nClinical data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren from 6 months to 9 years of age \nA dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine will be given.  \nIf a second dose of 0.25 ml is given this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose.  \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months of age \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Arepanrix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Arepanrix (and not another vaccine \nagainst H1N1) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Arepanrix can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Arepanrix (H5N1) in clinical studies in adults, \nincluding the elderly. In these clinical studies most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \nThe side-effects are generally similar to those related to seasonal flu vaccines.  \n \nThese side effects have also been observed with similar frequencies in clinical studies in adults \nincluding the elderly and in children aged 10 to 17 years with a similar vaccine (H1N1), except for \nredness (uncommon in the adults and common in the elderly) and fever (uncommon in the adults and \nelderly). Gastro-intestinal symptoms and shivering were at a higher rate in the children 10-17 years of \nage. In children aged 3-9 years who received a first half adult dose of a similar vaccine (H1N1), the \nside effects were similar compared to the side effects reported in adults, with the exception of \nshivering, sweating and gastro-intestinal symptoms which were reported at a higher rate in children \naged 3 to 9 years. Additionally, in children aged 3 to 5 years of age, drowsiness, irritability and loss of \nappetite were reported very commonly. \n \nVery common: \nâ¢ Pain at the injection site \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  37 \n\nâ¢ Headache \nâ¢ Tiredness \nâ¢ Aching muscles, joint pain \n \nCommon: \nâ¢ Redness and swelling at the injection site \nâ¢ Fever \nâ¢ Sweating \nâ¢ Shivering \nâ¢ Diarrhoea, feeling sick \n \nUncommon: \nâ¢ Reactions at the injection site such as bruising, hard lump, itching, warmth \nâ¢ Swollen glands in the axilla \nâ¢ Dizziness \nâ¢ Generally feeling unwell \nâ¢ Unusual weakness  \nâ¢ Being sick, stomach pain, acid indigestion \nâ¢ Inability to sleep \nâ¢ Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet \nâ¢ Shortness of breath \nâ¢ Pain in the chest \nâ¢ Itching, rash \nâ¢ Pain in the back or neck, stiffness in the muscles, muscle spasms, pain in extremity such as leg \n\nor hand \n \nIn children aged 6-35 months who received a half of the adult dose (0.25 ml) of a similar vaccine \n(H1N1), fever and irritability occurred more often compared to the children 3-9 years who received a \nhalf of the adult dose (0.25 ml) of a similar vaccine (H5N1). \n \nIn children aged 6-35 months who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) the side \neffects after the second dose were more intense, especially fever (â¥38Â°C), which occurred very \ncommonly.  \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1 to 2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred during post-marketing surveillance with a similar vaccine \n(H1N1).  These side effects may occur with Arepanrix. \n \nâ¢ Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may \n\nlead to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for \nuse in such cases. \n\nâ¢ Generalised skin reactions including facial swelling and urticaria (hives) \nâ¢ Fits due to fever \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given \nroutinely every year to prevent flu.  These side effects may occur with Arepanrix. \n \nRare \nâ¢ Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \nâ¢ Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising  \n \nVery rare \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  38 \n\nâ¢ Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \nproblems) \n\nâ¢ Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), \nneuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known a Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome \n\n \nIf any of these side effects occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Arepanrix \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nBefore the vaccine is mixed: \nDo not use the suspension and the emulsion after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.  The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2Â°C to 8Â°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze.   \n \nAfter the vaccine is mixed: \nAfter mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours and do not store above 25Â°C. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature. Whitish sediments may be observed in the suspension vial; \nthese sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of the suspension.  The emulsion \npresents as a whitish appearance \n\n2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than \nthe white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of \neither being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen.  \n\n4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the \nvaccine. \n\n5. The volume of the Arepanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 âHow Arepanrix is \ngivenâ). \n\n6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly. \n\n8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2Â°C - 8Â°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25Â°C. If the mixed vaccine is \nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature before each withdrawal. \n\n \nThe vaccine should not be administered intravascularly. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
