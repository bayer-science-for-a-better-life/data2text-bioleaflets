This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAlecensa 150 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains alectinib hydrochloride equivalent to 150 mg alectinib. \n \nExcipients with known effect  \nEach hard capsule contains 33.7 mg lactose (as monohydrate) and 6 mg sodium (as sodium \nlaurilsulfate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nWhite hard capsule of 19.2 mm length, with “ALE” printed in black ink on the cap and “150 mg” \nprinted in black ink on the body.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAlecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic \nlymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). \n \nAlecensa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced \nNSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Alecensa should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nA validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients. ALK-positive \nNSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of Alecensa therapy.  \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Alecensa is 600 mg (four 150 mg capsules) taken twice daily with food \n(total daily dose of 1200 mg).  \n \nPatients with underlying severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) should receive a starting dose of \n450 mg taken twice daily with food (total daily dose of 900 mg). \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment with Alecensa should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDelayed or missed doses \nIf a planned dose of Alecensa is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due \nwithin 6 hours. Patients should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. If \nvomiting occurs after taking a dose of Alecensa, patients should take the next dose at the scheduled \ntime. \n \nDose adjustments \nManagement of adverse events may require dose reduction, temporary interruption, or discontinuation \nof treatment with Alecensa. The dose of Alecensa should be reduced in steps of 150 mg twice daily \nbased on tolerability. Alecensa treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to \ntolerate the 300 mg twice daily dose.  \n \nDose modification advice is provided in Tables 1 and 2 below. \n \nTable 1 Dose reduction schedule \n \n\nDose reduction schedule Dose level \nDose 600 mg twice daily \nFirst dose reduction 450 mg twice daily \nSecond dose reduction 300 mg twice daily \n \nTable 2 Dose modification advice for specified Adverse Drug Reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n \nCTCAE grade Alecensa treatment \n\nILD/pneumonitis of any severity grade  Immediately interrupt and permanently \ndiscontinue Alecensa if no other potential causes \nof ILD/pneumonitis have been identified. \n\nALT or AST elevation of Grade ≥ 3 (> 5 times \nULN) with total bilirubin ≤ 2 times ULN \n\nTemporarily withhold until recovery to baseline or \n≤ Grade 1 (≤ 3 times ULN), then resume at \nreduced dose (see Table 1). \n\nALT or AST elevation of Grade ≥ 2 (> 3 times \nULN) with total bilirubin elevation > 2 times \nULN in the absence of cholestasis or haemolysis  \n\nPermanently discontinue Alecensa.  \n\nBradycardiaa Grade 2 or Grade 3 (symptomatic, \nmay be severe and medically significant, \nmedical intervention indicated)  \n\n \n\nTemporarily withhold until recovery to ≤ Grade 1 \n(asymptomatic) bradycardia or to a heart rate of \n≥ 60 bpm. Evaluate concomitant medicinal \nproducts known to cause bradycardia, as well as \nanti-hypertensive medicinal products. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \nresume at previous dose upon recovery to \n≤ Grade 1 (asymptomatic) bradycardia or to a heart \nrate of ≥ 60 bpm.  \n\nIf no contributing concomitant medicinal product \nis identified, or if contributing concomitant \nmedicinal products are not discontinued or dose \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCTCAE grade Alecensa treatment \n\nmodified, resume at reduced dose (see Table 1) \nupon recovery to ≤ Grade 1 (asymptomatic) \nbradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm. \n\nBradycardiaa Grade 4 (life-threatening \nconsequences, urgent intervention indicated) \n\nPermanently discontinue if no contributing \nconcomitant medicinal product is identified. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \nresume at reduced dose (see Table 1) upon \nrecovery to ≤ Grade 1 (asymptomatic) bradycardia \nor to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, with frequent \nmonitoring as clinically indicated.  \n\nPermanently discontinue in case of recurrence. \n\nCPK elevation > 5 times ULN Temporarily withhold until recovery to baseline or \nto ≤ 2.5 times ULN, then resume at the same dose. \n\nCPK elevation > 10 times ULN or second \noccurrence of CPK elevation of > 5 times ULN \n\nTemporarily withhold until recovery to baseline or \nto ≤ 2.5 times ULN, then resume at reduced dose \nas per Table 1.  \n\nALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; CPK = creatine phosphokinase; CTCAE = \nNCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; ILD = interstitial lung disease; ULN = upper limit of \nnormal \na Heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo starting dose adjustment is required in patients with underlying mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Patients with underlying severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nC) should receive a starting dose of 450 mg taken twice daily (total dose of 900 mg) (see section 5.2). \nFor all patients with hepatic impairment, appropriate monitoring (e.g. markers of liver function) is \nadvised, see section 4.4. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Alecensa has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe renal impairment. However, since alectinib elimination via the \nkidney is negligible, no dose adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nThe limited data on the safety and efficacy of Alecensa in patients aged 65 years and older do not \nsuggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available \ndata on patients over 80 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Alecensa in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nExtreme body weight (>130 kg) \nAlthough PK simulations for Alecensa do not indicate a low exposure in patients with extreme body \nweight (i.e. >130 kg), alectinib is widely distributed and clinical studies for alectinib enrolled patients \nwithin a range of body weights of 36.9−123 kg. There are no available data on patients with body \nweight above 130 kg. \n \nMethod of administration  \nAlecensa is for oral use. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole, and must not be opened or \ndissolved. They must be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to alectinib or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis \nCases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported in clinical trials with Alecensa (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Alecensa should be \nimmediately interrupted in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and should be permanently \ndiscontinued if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified (see section 4.2).  \n \nHepatotoxicity \nElevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than \n5 times the ULN as well as bilirubin elevations of more than 3 times the ULN occurred in patients in \npivotal clinical trials with Alecensa (see section 4.8). The majority of these events occurred during the \nfirst 3 months of treatment. In the pivotal Alecensa clinical trials it was reported that three patients \nwith Grade 3-4 AST/ALT elevations had drug induced liver injury. Concurrent elevations in ALT or \nAST greater than or equal 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal 2 times the ULN, \nwith normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient treated in Alecensa clinical trials. \n \nLiver function, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should be monitored at baseline and then \nevery 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring should be performed \nperiodically, since events may occur later than 3 months, with more frequent testing in patients who \ndevelop aminotransferase and bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, \nAlecensa should be withheld and resumed at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinued as described \nin Table 2 (see section 4.2).  \n \nSevere myalgia and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation \nMyalgia or musculoskeletal pain was reported in patients in pivotal trials with Alecensa, including \nGrade 3 events (see section 4.8).  \n \nElevations of CPK occurred in pivotal trials with Alecensa, including Grade 3 events (see section 4.8). \nMedian time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, \nBO28984).   \n \nPatients should be advised to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. CPK \nlevels should be assessed every two weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically indicated \nin patients reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, Alecensa should be \nwithheld, then resumed or dose reduced (see section 4.2). \n \nBradycardia \nSymptomatic bradycardia can occur with Alecensa (see section 4.8). Heart rate and blood pressure \nshould be monitored as clinically indicated. Dose modification is not required in case of asymptomatic \nbradycardia (see section 4.2). If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia or life-threatening \nevents, concomitant medicinal products known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmedicinal products should be evaluated and Alecensa treatment should be adjusted as described in \nTable 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.5, ‘P-gp substrates’ and ‘BCRP substrates’). \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \nCases of gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in patients at increased risk (e.g., history of \ndiverticulitis, metastases to the gastrointestinal tract, concomitant use of medicinal product with a \nrecognized risk of gastrointestinal perforation) treated with alectinib. Discontinuation of alectinib in \npatients who develop gastrointestinal perforation should be considered. Patients should be informed of \nthe signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforations and advised to consult rapidly in case of \noccurrence. \n \nPhotosensitivity \nPhotosensitivity to sunlight has been reported with Alecensa administration (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking Alecensa, and for at least 7 days after \ndiscontinuation of treatment. Patients should also be advised to use a broad-spectrum Ultraviolet A \n(UVA)/ Ultraviolet B (UVB) sun screen and lip balm (SPF ≥50) to help protect against potential \nsunburn.   \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nAlecensa may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of \nchild-bearing potential receiving Alecensa, must use highly effective contraceptive methods during \ntreatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Alecensa (see sections 4.6 and 5.3).  \n \nLactose intolerance \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, a congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicinal product contains 48 mg sodium per daily dose (1200 mg), equivalent to 2.4% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on alectinib \nBased on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme mediating the metabolism of both alectinib \nand its major active metabolite M4, and CYP3A contributes to 40% − 50% of total hepatic metabolism. \nM4 has shown similar in vitro potency and activity against ALK. \n \nCYP3A inducers \nCo-administration of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampicin once daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, \nwith a single oral dose of 600 mg alectinib reduced alectinib Cmax, and AUCinf by 51% and 73% \nrespectively and increased M4 Cmax and AUCinf 2.20 and 1.79-fold respectively. The effect on the \ncombined exposure of alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax and AUCinf by 4% and 18%, \nrespectively. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose adjustments \nare required when Alecensa is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Appropriate monitoring is \nrecommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum)). \n \nCYP3A inhibitors  \nCo-administration of multiple oral doses of 400 mg posaconazole twice daily, a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor, with a single oral dose of 300 mg alectinib increased alectinib exposure Cmax and AUCinf by \n1.18 and 1.75-fold respectively, and reduced M4 Cmax and AUCinf by 71% and 25% respectively.The \neffect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4 was minor, reducing Cmax by 7% and increasing \nAUCinf 1.36-fold. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4, no dose \nadjustments are required when Alecensa is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Appropriate \n\n\n\n7 \n\nmonitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but \nnot limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, \nposaconazole nefazodone, grapefruit or Seville oranges). \n \nMedicinal products that increase gastric pH  \nMultiple doses of esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 40 mg once daily, demonstrated no \nclinically relevant effect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4. Therefore, no dose \nadjustments are required when Alecensa is co-administered with proton pump inhibitors or other \nmedicinal products which raise gastric pH (e.g. H2 receptor antagonists or antacids). \n \nEffect of transporters on alectinib disposition \nM4 is a substrate of P-gp. As alectinib inhibits P-gp, it is not expected that co-medication with P-gp \ninhibitors has a relevant effect on M4 exposure. \n \nEffects of alectinib on other medicinal products \n \nP-gp substrates \nIn vitro, alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter  \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, alectinib and M4 may have the potential to increase plasma \nconcentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. When Alecensa is co-administered with P-gp \nsubstrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, topotecan, sirolimus, everolimus, nilotinib and \nlapatinib), appropriate monitoring is recommended.  \n \nBCRP substrates \nIn vitro, alectinib and M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter Breast Cancer Resistance Protein \n(BCRP). Therefore, alectinib and M4 may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of \nco-administered substrates of BCRP. When Alecensa is co-administered with BCRP substrates (e.g., \nmethotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan and lapatinib), appropriate monitoring is recommended.  \n \nCYP substrates \nIn vitro, alectinib and M4 show weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4, and alectinib exhibits a \nweak induction potential of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at clinical concentrations.   \n \nMultiple doses of 600 mg alectinib had no influence on the exposure of midazolam (2 mg), a sensitive \nCYP3A substrate. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for co-administered CYP3A substrates.  \n \nA risk for induction of CYP2B6 and PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be \ncompletely excluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be \nreduced. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception  \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Alecensa. Female \npatients of child-bearing potential receiving Alecensa must use highly effective contraceptive methods \nduring treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of Alecensa. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Alecensa in pregnant women. Based on its \nmechanism of action, Alecensa may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nFemale patients, who become pregnant while taking Alecensa or during the 3 months following the \nlast dose of Alecensa must contact their doctor and should be advised of the potential harm to the \nfoetus. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether alectinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborn/infant cannot be excluded. Mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving \nAlecensa. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of Alecensa. No adverse \neffects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlecensa has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be exercised \nwhen driving or operating machines as patients may experience symptomatic bradycardia (e.g., \nsyncope, dizziness, hypotension) or vision disorders while taking Alecensa (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe data described below reflect exposure to Alecensa in 405 patients with ALK-positive advanced \nNSCLC who participated in one randomised Phase III clinical trial (BO28984) and in two single-arm \nphase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673). These patients were treated with the recommended dose \nof 600 mg twice daily. In  the phase II clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673; N=253), the median \nduration of exposure to Alecensa was 11 months. In BO28984 (ALEX; N=152) the median duration of \nexposure to Alecensa was 17.9 months, whereas the median duration of exposure to crizotinib was \n10.7 months.  \n \nThe most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 20%) were constipation (35%), oedema (30%, \nincluding oedema peripheral, oedema, generalised oedema, eyelid oedema, periorbital oedema, face \noedema and localised oedema), and myalgia (28%, including myalgia and musculoskeletal pain).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions \nTable 3 lists the ADRs occurring in patients who received Alecensa across two phase II clinical trials \n(NP28761, NP28673) and one phase III clinical trial (BO28984; ALEX),  and during post-marketing.  \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 are presented by system organ class and frequency categories, defined \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000). Within each system organ \nclass, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing frequency. \n \nTable 3 ADRs reported in Alecensa clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984; N=405) and \nduring post-marketing \n \nSystem organ class \n    ADRs (MedDRA) \n\nAlecensa \nN=405 \n\n All grades  \n(%) \n\nFrequency category \n(all grades) \n\nGrades 3-4  \n(%) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n    Anaemia1) 17 Very common 3.0 \nNervous system disorders \n    Dysgeusia 2)  5.2 Common 0.2  \nEye disorders \n    Vision disorders3) 8.6 Common 0 \nCardiac disorders \n    Bradycardia4) 8.9 Common 0 \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem organ class \n    ADRs (MedDRA) \n\nAlecensa \nN=405 \n\n All grades  \n(%) \n\nFrequency category \n(all grades) \n\nGrades 3-4  \n(%) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n    Interstitial lung disease / \npneumonitis \n\n0.7 Uncommon 0.2 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n    Constipation  35 Very common 0 \n    Nausea  19 Very common 0.5 \n    Diarrhoea  16 Very common 0.7 \n    Vomiting  11 Very common 0.2 \n    Stomatitis 5) 3.0 Common 0 \nHepatobiliary disorders \n    Increased bilirubin6)  18 Very common 3.2 \n    Increased AST  15 Very common 3.7 \n    Increased ALT  14 Very common 3.7 \n    Increased alkaline \nphosphatase** \n\n6.2 Common 0.2 \n\n    Drug-induced liver injury7) 0.7 Uncommon 0.7 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n    Rash8)  18 Very common 0.5 \n    Photosensitivity 9.1 Common 0.2 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissues disorders \n    Myalgia9) 28 Very common 0.7 \n    Increased blood creatine \nphosphokinase \n\n10 Very common 3.2 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n    Blood creatinine increased 7.2 Common 0.7* \n    Acute kidney injury 1.0 Common 1.0* \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n    Oedema10)  30 Very common 0.7 \nInvestigations \n    Weight increased 12 Very common 0.7 \n* Includes one Grade 5 event \n** Increased alkaline phosphatase was reported in the post-marketing period and in pivotal phase II and phase III \nclinical trials.  \n1) includes cases of anaemia and haemoglobin decreased  \n2) includes cases of dysgeusia and hypogeusia \n3) includes cases of blurred vision, visual impairment, vitreous floaters, reduced visual acuity, asthenopia, and \ndiplopia \n4) includes cases of bradycardia and sinus bradycardia \n5) includes cases of stomatitis and mouth ulceration \n6) includes cases of blood bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin conjugated increased  \n7) includes two patients with reported MedDRA term of drug-induced liver injury as well as one patient with \nreported Grade 4 increased AST and ALT who had documented drug-induced liver injury by liver biopsy \n8) includes cases of rash, rash maculopapular, dermatitis acneiform, erythema, rash generalised, rash papular, \nrash pruritic, rash macular and exfoliative rash \n9) includes cases of myalgia and musculoskeletal pain \n10) includes cases of oedema peripheral, oedema, generalised oedema, eyelid oedema, periorbital oedema, face \noedema and localised oedema \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nThe safety profile of Alecensa was generally consistent across the pivotal phase III clinical trial \nBO28984 (ALEX) and phase II trials (NP28761, NP28673). \n \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) / pneumonitis  \nSevere ILD/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Alecensa. Across clinical trials (NP28761, \nNP28673, BO28984), 1 out of 405 patients treated with Alecensa (0.2%) had a Grade 3 ILD. This \nevent led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. In the phase III clinical trial BO28984, Grade 3 or 4 \nILD/pneumonitis was not observed in patients receiving Alecensa versus 2.0% of patients receiving \ncrizotinib. There were no fatal cases of ILD in any of the clinical trials. Patients should be monitored \nfor pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatotoxicity \nAcross clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984) two patients with Grade 3-4 AST/ALT \nelevations had documented drug induced liver injury by liver biopsy. In addition, one patient \nexperienced a Grade 4 adverse event of drug-induced liver injury. Two of these cases led to \nwithdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Adverse reactions of increased AST and ALT levels (15% and \n14% respectively) were reported in patients treated with Alecensa across clinical trials (NP28761, \nNP28673, BO28984). The majority of these events were of Grade 1 and 2 intensity, and events of \nGrade ≥ 3 were reported in 3.7% and 3.7% of the patients, respectively. The events generally occurred \nduring the first 3 months of treatment, were usually transient and resolved upon temporary interruption \nof Alecensa treatment (reported for 1.5% and 3.0% of the patients, respectively) or dose reduction \n(2.2% and 1.2%, respectively). In 1.2% and 1.5% of the patients, AST and ALT elevations, \nrespectively, led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were \neach observed in 5% of patients receiving Alecensa versus 15% and 11% of patients receiving \ncrizotinib in the phase III clinical trial BO28984.  \n \nAdverse reactions of bilirubin elevations were reported in 18% of the patients treated with Alecensa \nacross clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). The majority of the events were of Grade 1 and \n2 intensity; Grade 3 events were reported in 3.2% of the patients. The events generally occurred during \nthe first 3 months of treatment, were usually transient and the majority resolved upon dose \nmodification. In 5.2% of patients, bilirubin elevations led to dose modifications and in 1.5% of \npatients, bilirubin elevations led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. In the phase III clinical trial \nBO28984, Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin elevations occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving Alecensa versus no \npatient receiving crizotinib.  \n \nConcurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to three times the ULN and total bilirubin \ngreater than or equal to two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in one patient \n(0.2%) treated in Alecensa clinical trials. \n \nPatients should be monitored for liver function including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin as outlined in \nsection 4.4 and managed as recommended in section 4.2. \n \nBradycardia  \nCases of bradycardia (8.9%) of Grade 1 or 2 have been reported in patients treated with Alecensa \nacross clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). No patients had events of Grade ≥ 3 severity. \nThere were 66 of 365 patients (18%) treated with Alecensa who had post-dose heart rate values below \n50 beats per minutes (bpm). In the phase III clinical trial BO28984 15% of patients treated with \nAlecensa had post-dose heart rate values below 50 bpm versus 20% of patients treated with crizotinib. \nPatients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 \nand 4.4. No case of bradycardia led to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSevere myalgia and CPK elevations  \nCases of myalgia (28%) including myalgia events (22%) and musculoskeletal pain (7.4%) have been \nreported in patients treated with Alecensa across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). The \nmajority of events were Grades 1 or 2 and three patients (0.7%) had a Grade 3 event. Dose \nmodifications of Alecensa treatment due to these adverse events were only required for two patients \n(0.5%); Alecensa treatment was not withdrawn due to these events of myalgia. Elevations of CPK \noccurred in 43% of 362 patients with CPK laboratory data available across clinical trials (NP28761, \nNP28673, BO28984) with Alecensa. The incidence of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 3.7%. Median \ntime to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days across trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984). Dose \nmodifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 3.2% of patients; withdrawal from Alecensa treatment \ndid not occur due to CPK elevations. Severe myalgia has not been reported in the clinical trial \nBO28984. Grade 3 elevation of CPK was reported for 2.6% of patients receiving Alecensa and 1.3% \nof patients receiving crizotinib;  and median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 27.5 days and 369 \ndays, respectively, in the pivotal phase III clinical trial BO28984 (ALEX).   \n \nGastrointestinal effects  \nConstipation (35%), nausea (19%), diarrhoea (16%) and vomiting (11%) were the most commonly \nreported gastrointestinal (GI) reactions. Most of these events were of mild or moderate severity; \nGrade 3 events were reported for diarrhea (0.7%), nausea (0.5%), and vomiting (0.2%). These events \ndid not lead to withdrawal from Alecensa treatment. Median time to onset for constipation, nausea, \ndiarrhea, and/or vomiting events across clinical trials (NP28761, NP28673, BO28984) was 21 days. \nThe events declined in frequency after the first month of treatment. In the phase III clinical trial \nBO28984, one patient (0.2%) experienced a Grade 4 event of nausea in the Alecensa arm and the \nincidence of Grade 3 and 4 events for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea was 3.3%, 3.3%, and 2.0%, \nrespectively, in the crizotinib arm.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nPatients who experience overdose should be closely supervised and general supportive care instituted. \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Alecensa. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-neoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor; ATC code: L01XE36. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAlectinib is a highly selective and potent ALK and RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In preclinical \nstudies, inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity led to blockage of downstream signalling pathways \nincluding STAT 3 and PI3K/AKT and induction of tumour cell death (apoptosis). \n \nAlectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, \nincluding mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib. The major metabolite of alectinib (M4) \nhas shown similar in vitro potency and activity.  \n \nBased on preclinical data, alectinib is not a substrate of p-glycoprotein or BCRP, which are both efflux \ntransporters in the blood brain barrier, and is therefore able to distribute into and be retained within the \ncentral nervous system.  \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n12 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nALK positive non-small cell lung cancer \n \nTreatment-naïve patients \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Alecensa were studied in a global randomised Phase III open label clinical \ntrial (BO28984, ALEX) in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who were treatment naïve. Central testing \nfor ALK protein expression positivity of tissue samples from all patients by Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) was required before randomisation into the study. \n \nA total of 303 patients were included in the Phase III trial, 151 patients randomised to the crizotinib \narm and 152 patients randomised to the Alecensa arm receiving Alecensa orally, at the recommended \ndose of 600 mg twice daily.  \n \nECOG PS (0/1 vs. 2), race (Asian vs. non-Asian), and CNS metastases at baseline (yes vs. no) were \nstratification factors for randomisation. The primary endpoint of the trial was to demonstrate \nsuperiority of Alecensa versus crizotinib based on Progression Free survival (PFS) as per investigator \nassessment using RECIST 1.1. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics for Alecensa were \nmedian age 58 years (54 years for crizotinib), 55% female (58% for crizotinib), 55% non-Asian (54% \nfor crizotinib), 61% with no smoking history (65% for crizotinib), 93% ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (93% for \ncrizotinib), 97% Stage IV disease (96% for crizotinib), 90% adenocarcinoma histology (94% for \ncrizotinib), 40% CNS metastases at baseline (38% for crizotinib) and 17% having received prior CNS \nradiation (14% for crizotinib).  \n \nThe trial met its primary endpoint at the primary analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant \nimprovement in PFS by investigator. Efficacy data are summarised in Table 4 and the Kaplan-Meier \ncurve for investigator assessed PFS is shown in Figure 1. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 4 Summary of efficacy results from study BO28984 (ALEX) \n \n\n Crizotinib N=151 \nAlecensa \nN=152 \n\nMedian duration of follow-up (months) 17.6 (range 0.3 – 27.0) \n18.6 \n\n(range 0.5 – 29.0) \n\nPrimary efficacy parameter \n \n\n  \n\nPFS (INV)  \nNumber of patients with event n (%) \nMedian (months) \n[95% CI] \n\n \n102 (68%) \n\n11.1  \n[9.1; 13.1] \n\n \n62 (41%) \n\nNE \n[17.7; NE] \n\n \nHR \n[95% CI] \nStratified log-rank p-value \n \n\n \n0.47 \n\n[0.34, 0.65] \np <0.0001 \n\nSecondary efficacy parameters \n \n\n  \n\nPFS (IRC)* \nNumber of patients with event n (%) \nMedian (months) \n[95% CI] \n\n \n92 (61%) \n\n10.4 \n[7.7; 14.6] \n\n \n63 (41%) \n\n25.7 \n[19.9; NE] \n\n \nHR \n[95% CI] \nStratified log-rank p-value \n\n \n\n \n0.50 \n\n[0.36; 0.70] \np < 0.0001 \n\nTime to CNS progression (IRC)*, ** \nNumber of patients with event n (%) \n\n \n68 (45%) \n\n \n18 (12%) \n\n \nCause-specific HR  \n[95% CI] \nStratified log-rank p-value \n \n\n \n0.16 \n\n[0.10; 0.28] \np < 0.0001 \n\n \n12-month cumulative incidence of CNS \nprogression (IRC)  \n[95% CI] \n \n\n \n41.4% \n\n[33.2; 49.4] \n\n \n9.4% \n\n[5.4; 14.7] \n\nORR (INV)*, *** \nResponders n (%) \n[95% CI] \n \n\n \n114 (75.5%) \n[67.8; 82.1] \n\n \n126 (82.9%) \n[76.0; 88.5] \n\nOverall survival* \nNumber of patients with event n (%) \nMedian (months) \n[95% CI] \n\n \n40 (27%) \n\nNE \n[NE; NE] \n\n \n35 (23%) \n\nNE \n[NE; NE] \n\n \nHR \n[95% CI] \n\n \n0.76 \n\n[0.48; 1.20] \n \n\nDuration of response (INV) \nMedian (months) \n[95 % CI] \n \n\nN=114 \n11.1 \n\n[7.9; 13.0] \n\nN=126 \nNE \n\n[NE; NE] \n\n\n\n14 \n\n Crizotinib N=151 \nAlecensa \nN=152 \n\nCNS-ORR in patients with measurable CNS \nmetastases at baseline \n\nCNS responders n (%) \n[95% CI] \n \nCNS-CR n (%) \n \nCNS-DOR, median (months) \n[95% CI] \n\n \n\nN=22 \n \n\n11 (50.0%) \n [28.2; 71.8] \n\n \n1 (5%) \n\n \n5.5 \n\n[2.1, 17.3] \n\nN=21 \n \n\n17 (81.0%) \n[58.1; 94.6] \n\n \n8 (38%) \n\n \n17.3 \n\n[14.8, NE] \n\nCNS-ORR in patients with measurable and \nnon-measurable CNS metastases at baseline \n(IRC) \n\nCNS responders n (%) \n[95% CI] \n\n \nCNS-CR n (%)  \n \nCNS-DOR, median (months) \n[95% CI] \n \n\nN=58 \n \n \n\n15 (25.9%) \n[15.3; 39.0] \n\n \n5 (9%) \n\n \n3.7 \n\n[3.2, 6.8] \n\nN=64 \n \n \n\n38 (59.4%) \n[46.4; 71.5] \n\n \n29 (45%) \n\n \nNE \n\n[17.3, NE] \n\n* Key secondary endpoints part of the hierarchical testing \n** Competing risk analysis of CNS progression, systemic progression and death as competing events \n*** 2 patients in the crizotinib arm and 6 patients in the alectinib arm had CR \nCI = confidence interval; CNS = central nervous system; CR = complete response; DOR = duration of response; \nHR = hazard ratio; IRC = Independent Review Committee; INV = investigator; NE = not estimable; \nORR = objective response rate; PFS = progression free survival \n \nThe PFS benefit was consistent for patients with CNS metastases at baseline (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: \n0.25-0.64, median PFS for Alecensa = NE, 95% CI: 9.2-NE, median PFS for crizotinib = 7.4 months, \n95%CI: 6.6-9.6) and without CNS metastases at baseline (HR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, median PFS \nfor Alecensa = NE, 95% CI: NE, NE, median PFS for crizotinib = 14.8 months, 95% CI:10.8-20.3), \nindicating benefit of Alecensa over crizotinib in both subgroups.  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier Plot of INV Assessed PFS in BO28984 (ALEX) \n \n\n \n\n \nCrizotinib pre-treated patients \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Alecensa in ALK-positive NSCLC patients pre-treated with crizotinib were \nstudied in two Phase I/II clinical trials (NP28673 and NP28761).  \n \nNP28673 \nStudy NP28673 was a Phase I/II single arm, multicentre study conducted in patients with \nALK-positive advanced NSCLC who have previously progressed on crizotinib treatment. In addition \nto crizotinib, patients may have received previous treatment with chemotherapy. A total of \n138 patients were included in the phase II part of the study and received Alecensa orally, at the \nrecommended dose of 600 mg twice daily.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of Alecensa by Objective Response Rate (ORR) as \nper central Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in \nSolid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the overall population (with and without prior exposure of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy treatments). The co-primary endpoint was to evaluate the ORR as per central \nIRC assessment using RECIST 1.1 in patients with prior exposure of cytotoxic chemotherapy \ntreatments. A lower confidence limit for the estimated ORR above the pre-specified threshold of 35% \nwould achieve a statistically significant result. \n \nPatient demographics were consistent with that of a NSCLC ALK positive population. The \ndemographic characteristics of the overall study population were 67% Caucasian, 26% Asian, 56% \nfemales, and the median age was 52 years. The majority of patients had no history of smoking (70%). \nThe ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 90.6% \nof patients and 2 in 9.4% of patients. At the time of entry in the study, 99% of patients had stage IV \ndisease, 61% had brain metastases and in 96% of patients tumours were classified as adenocarcinoma. \nAmong patients included in the study, 20% of the patients had previously progressed on crizotinib \ntreatment only, and 80% had previously progressed on crizotinib and at least one chemotherapy \ntreatment.   \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nStudy NP28761 \nStudy NP28761 was a Phase I/II single arm multicentre study conducted in patients with ALK positive \nadvanced NSCLC who have previously progressed on crizotinib treatment. In addition to crizotinib, \npatients may have received previous treatment with chemotherapy. A total of 87 patients were \nincluded in the phase II part of the study and received Alecensa orally, at the recommended dose of \n600 mg twice daily.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of Alecensa by ORR as per central IRC assessment \nusing RECIST version 1.1. A lower confidence limit for the estimated ORR above the pre-specified \nthreshold of 35% would achieve a statistically significant result. \n \nPatient demographics were consistent with that of a NSCLC ALK positive population. The \ndemographic characteristics of the overall study population were 84% Caucasian, 8% Asian, 55% \nfemales. The median age was 54 years. The majority of patients had no history of smoking (62%). The \nECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 89.7% of patients and 2 in 10.3% of patients.

Based on population \npharmacokinetic analysis, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and \nAUC0-12hr for alectinib were approximately 665 ng/mL (44.3%), 572 ng/mL (47.8%) and 7430 \nng*h/mL (45.7%), respectively. The geometric mean steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-12hr for M4 \nwere approximately 246 ng/mL (45.4%), 222 ng/mL (46.6%) and 2810 ng*h/mL (45.9%), \nrespectively. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration of 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in ALK-positive NSCLC \npatients, alectinib was absorbed reaching Tmax after approximately 4 to 6 hours.  \n \nAlectinib steady-state is reached within 7 days with continuous 600 mg twice daily dosing. The \naccumulation ratio for the twice-daily 600 mg regimen was approximately 6-fold. Population PK \nanalysis supports dose proportionality for alectinib across the dose range of 300 to 900 mg under fed \nconditions. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of alectinib capsules was 36.9% (90% CI: 33.9%, 40.3%) under fed \nconditions in healthy subjects. \n \nFollowing a single oral administration of 600 mg with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, alectinib and M4 \nexposure was increased by around 3-fold relative to fasted conditions (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \nAlectinib and its major metabolite M4 are highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), \nindependent of active substance concentration. The mean in vitro human blood-to-plasma \nconcentration ratios of alectinib and M4 are 2.64 and 2.50, respectively, at clinically relevant \nconcentrations.   \nThe geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of alectinib following IV \nadministration was 475 L, indicating extensive distribution into tissues. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nBased on in vitro data, alectinib is not a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of \nBCRP or organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/B3. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP3A4 is the main CYP isozyme mediating alectinib and its \nmajor metabolite M4 metabolism, and is estimated to contribute 40-50% of alectinib metabolism. \nResults from the human mass balance study demonstrated that alectinib and M4 were the main \ncirculating moieties in plasma with 76% of the total radioactivity in plasma. The geometric mean \nMetabolite/Parent ratio at steady state is 0.399.  \nMetabolite M1b was detected as a minor metabolite from in vitro and in human plasma in healthy \nsubjects. Formation of metabolite M1b and its minor isomer M1a is likely to be catalyzed by a \ncombination of CYP isozymes (including isozymes other than CYP3A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase \n(ALDH) enzymes. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that neither alectinib nor its major active metabolite (M4) inhibits CYP1A2, \nCYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations.  Alectinib did not \ninhibit OATP1B1/OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. \n \nElimination \nFollowing administration of a single dose of 14C-labeled alectinib administered orally to healthy \nsubjects the majority of radioactivity was excreted in faeces (mean recovery 97.8%) with minimal \nexcretion in urine (mean recovery 0.46%). In faeces, 84% and 5.8% of the dose was excreted as \nunchanged alectinib or M4, respectively.    \nBased on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of alectinib was 81.9 L/hour. The \ngeometric mean of the individual elimination half-life estimates for alectinib was 32.5 hours. The \ncorresponding values for M4 were 217 L/hour and 30.7 hours, respectively.  \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNegligible amounts of alectinib and the active metabolite M4 are excreted unchanged in urine (< 0.2% \nof the dose). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis alectinib and M4 exposures were similar \nin patients with mild and moderate renal impairment and normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics \nof alectinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs elimination of alectinib is predominantly through metabolism in the liver, hepatic impairment may \nincrease the plasma concentration of alectinib and/or its major metabolite M4. Based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis, alectinib and M4 exposures were similar in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment and normal hepatic function.  \n \nFollowing administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg alectinib in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh \nC) hepatic impairment, alectinib Cmax was the same  and AUCinf was 2.2-fold higher compared with the \nsame parameters in matched healthy subjects. M4 Cmax and AUCinf was 39% and 34% lower \nrespectively, resulting in a combined exposure of alectinib and M4 (AUCinf) 1.8-fold higher in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment compared with matched healthy subjects.  \n \nThe hepatic impairment study also included a group with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic \nimpairment, and a modestly higher alectinib exposure was observed in this  group compared with \nmatched healthy subjects. The subjects in the Child Pugh B group however did in general not suffer \nfrom abnormal bilirubin, albumin or prothrombin time, indicating that they may not be fully \nrepresentative of moderately hepatically impaired subjects with decreased metabolic capacity. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nEffects of age, body weight, race and gender \nAge, body weight, race and gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of \nalectinib and M4. The range of body weights for patients enrolled in clinical studies is 36.9-123 kg. \nThere are no available data on patients with extreme body weight (>130 kg) (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of Alecensa. \n \nMutagenicity \nAlectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay but induced a \nslight increase in numerical aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetic assay using Chinese Hamster Lung \n(CHL) cells with metabolic activation, and micronuclei in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test. The \nmechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity), and not \na clastogenic effect on chromosomes. \n \nImpairment of fertility \nNo fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of Alecensa. No adverse \neffects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies. These \nstudies were conducted in rats and monkeys at exposures equal to or greater than 2.6- and 0.5-fold, \nrespectively, of the human exposure, measured by AUC, at the recommended dose of 600 mg twice \ndaily. \n \nTeratogenicity \nAlectinib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits. In pregnant rats, alectinib caused \ntotal embryo-foetal loss (miscarriage) at exposures 4.5-fold of the human AUC exposure and small \nfoetuses with retarded ossification and minor abnormalities of the organs at exposures 2.7-fold of the \nhuman AUC exposure. In pregnant rabbits, alectinib caused embryo-foetal loss, small fetuses and \nincreased incidence of skeletal variations at exposures 2.9-fold of the human AUC exposure at the \nrecommended dose. \n \nOther \nAlectinib absorbs UV light between 200 and 400 nm and demonstrated a phototoxic potential in an in \nvitro photosafety test in cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA irradiation. \n \nTarget organs in both rat and monkey at clinically relevant exposures in the repeat-dose toxicology \nstudies included, but were not limited to the erythroid system, gastrointestinal tract, and hepatobiliary \nsystem.  \n \nAbnormal erythrocyte morphology was observed at exposures equal or greater than 10-60% the \nhuman exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Proliferative zone extension in GI mucosa in both \nspecies was observed at exposures equal to or greater than 20-120% of the human AUC exposure at \nthe recommended dose. Increased hepatic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and direct bilirubin as well as \nvacuolation/degeneration/necrosis of bile duct epithelium and enlargement/focal necrosis of \nhepatocytes was observed in rats and/or monkeys at exposures equal to or greater than 20-30% of the \nhuman exposure by AUC at the recommended dose.  \n \nA mild hypotensive effect has been observed in monkeys at around clinically relevant exposures. \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n6.

What Alecensa is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Alecensa is \nAlecensa is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance alectinib. \n \nWhat Alecensa is used for \nAlecensa is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer’ \n(‘NSCLC’). It is used if your lung cancer: \n● is ‘ALK-positive’ - this means your cancer cells have a fault in a gene that makes an enzyme called \n\nALK (‘anaplastic lymphoma kinase’), see ‘How Alecensa works’, below \n● and is advanced. \n \nAlecensa can be prescribed to you as first treatment of your lung cancer, or if you have been \npreviously treated with a medicine containing ‘crizotinib’. \n \nHow Alecensa works \nAlecensa blocks the action of an enzyme called ‘ALK tyrosine kinase’.

In all of them some risk factor was present, mostly some concomitant disease (such as \ndiverticulitis, appendicitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, metastases to intestine or ileus of intestine) or \nconcomitantly used medications (such as bevacizumab, opioids, dexamethasone or other/unspecified \ncorticosteroids).  \n\nThe results from toxicology studies, in monkeys treated with alectinib, a dilatation of the large \nintestine was seen, and a decreased stool, no-faeces, and retention of GI contents were seen in both \nrats and monkeys at 60 mg/kg/day and were accompanied by very slight erosions/ulcers in the \nstomach, duodenum, caecum and colon. \n\nThe risk of GI perforation is currently not present in the SmPC for alectinib.  The SmPC for crizotinib \nwhich also belongs to the ALK inhibitor class includes the GI perforation in sections 4.4 and 4.8.  \n\nThe retrieved cases of GI perforation do not provide a clear causal association with alectinib treatment. \nHowever, considering the results from toxicology studies in monkeys and rats, the seriousness of the \nevents of GI perforation which might lead to death and the importance of early recognition and prompt \nmedical intervention, it is considered that the product information of alectinib should include the \nwarning on possible risk of gastrointestinal perforation in patients who are at higher risk of \ndevelopment of such condition and recommended actions in the section 4.4 of SmPC and in the \ncorresponding part of the Package leaflet. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for alectinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alectinib is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
