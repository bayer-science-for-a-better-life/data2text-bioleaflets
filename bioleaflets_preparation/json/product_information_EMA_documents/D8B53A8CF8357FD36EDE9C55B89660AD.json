NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nEVENITY 105 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n\nEVENITY 105 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEVENITY 105 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled pen contains 105 mg of romosozumab in 1.17 ml of solution (90 mg/ml).  \n\n \n\nEVENITY 105 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 105 mg of romosozumab in 1.17 ml of solution (90 mg/ml).  \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody produced using recombinant DNA \n\ntechnology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. \n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection (injection)  \n\n \n\nClear to opalescent, colorless to light yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEVENITY is indicated in treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of \n\nfracture (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management \n\nof osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 210 mg romosozumab (administered as two subcutaneous injections of \n\n105 mg each) once monthly for 12 months. \n\n \n\nPatients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D before and during treatment \n\n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPatients treated with EVENITY should be given the package leaflet and the patient alert card. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n3 \n\nFollowing completion of romosozumab therapy, transition to antiresorptive therapy is recommended \n\nin order to extend the benefit achieved with romosozumab beyond 12 months. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf the romosozumab dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be feasible. Thereafter, the next \n\nromosozumab dose should not be given earlier than one month after the last dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see also section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Serum calcium \n\nshould be monitored in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nNo clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of romosozumab in paediatric patients (age <18 years) have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available.   \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous use  \n\nTo administer the 210 mg dose, 2 subcutaneous injections of romosozumab should be given into the \n\nabdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The second injection should be given immediately after the first one but \n\nat a different injection site. \n\n \n\nAdministration should be performed by an individual who has been trained in injection techniques.  \n\n \n\nFor instructions on handling and disposal see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n(see section 4.4) \n\n- Hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4) \n- History of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 4.4) \n \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nMyocardial infarction and stroke \n\nIn randomised controlled studies, an increase in serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction \n\nand stroke) has been observed in romosozumab treated patients compared to controls (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is contraindicated in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stroke (see section \n\n4.3). \n\n \n\nWhen determining whether to use romosozumab for an individual patient, consideration should be \n\ngiven to her fracture risk over the next year and her cardiovascular risk based on risk factors (e.g. \n\nestablished cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, severe \n\nrenal impairment, age). romosozumab should only be used if the prescriber and patient agree that the \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n4 \n\nbenefit outweighs the risk. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, \n\ntreatment with romosozumab should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\nTransient hypocalcaemia has been observed in patients receiving romosozumab.  \n\nHypocalcaemia should be corrected prior to initiating therapy with romosozumab and patients should \n\nbe monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia. If any patient presents with suspected \n\nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia during treatment (see section 4.8), calcium levels should be measured. \n\nPatients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to \n\n29 ml/min/1.73 m2) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia and the \n\nsafety data for these patients is limited. Calcium levels should be monitored in these patients. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nClinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and \n\nurticaria occurred in the romosozumab group in clinical trials. If an anaphylactic or other clinically \n\nsignificant allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated and use of romosozumab \n\nshould be discontinued (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), has been reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. The \n\nfollowing risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: \n\n-  potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (the risk increases with the \n\nantiresorptive potency of the compound), and cumulative dose of bone resorption therapy.  \n\n-  cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking.  \n\n-  concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck.  \n\n-  poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions.  \n\n \n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups, \n\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling or non-healing of \n\nsores or discharge during treatment with romosozumab. \n\n \n\nPatients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on romosozumab should receive care \n\nby a dentist or an oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Discontinuation of romosozumab therapy should \n\nbe considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk factors are mitigated where possible.   \n\n  \n\nAtypical femoral fractures  \n\nAtypical low-energy or low trauma fracture of the femoral shaft, which can occur spontaneously, has \n\nbeen reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. Any patient who presents with new or \n\nunusual thigh, hip, or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be \n\nevaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture \n\nshould also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of \n\nromosozumab therapy should be considered, based on an individual benefit-risk assessment. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say  essentially \n\nsodium-free. \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo drug interaction studies have been performed with romosozumab. No pharmacokinetic drug \n\ninteractions are expected with romosozumab. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is not indicated for use in women of child-bearing potential or in pregnant women. \n\nThere are no data from the use of romosozumab in pregnant women. Skeletal malformations \n\n(including syndactyly and polydactyly) were observed at a low incidence in a single study with \n\nromosozumab in rats (see section 5.3). A risk for malformations of developing digits in the human \n\nfoetus is low following romosozumab exposure due to the timing of digit formation in the first \n\ntrimester in humans, a period when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is not indicated for use in breast-feeding women. \n\n \n\nNo data are available on excretion of romosozumab in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be \n\nexcreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations \n\nsoon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short \n\nperiod.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the effect of romosozumab on human fertility. Animal studies in female and \n\nmale rats did not show any effects on fertility endpoints (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nRomosozumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (13.6%) and arthralgia (12.4%). \n\nHypersensitivity-related reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients treated with romosozumab. \n\nHypocalcaemia was reported uncommonly (0.4% of patients treated with romosozumab). In \n\nrandomised controlled studies, an increase in serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and \n\nstroke) has been observed in romosozumab treated patients compared to controls (see section 4.4 and \n\ninformation below). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: \n\nvery common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \n\nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping and system \n\norgan class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n6 \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction \nFrequency \n\ncategory \n\nInfections and infestations \nNasopharyngitis Very common \n\nSinusitis Common \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivitya \n\nRash \n\nDermatitis \n\nUrticaria  \n\nAngioedema \n\nErythema multiforme \n\nCommon \n\nCommon \n\nCommon \n\nUncommon  \n\nRare \n\nRare \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hypocalcaemiab Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Common \n\nStrokec Uncommon \n\nEye disorders Cataract Uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders Myocardial infarctionc Uncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nArthralgia Very common \n\nNeck pain Common \n\nMuscle spasms Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \nInjection site reactionsd Common \n\na.

See section “Myocardial infarction and stroke” below. \nd. Most frequent injection site reactions were pain and erythema. \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nIn postmenopausal women dosed with monthly romosozumab, the incidence of anti-romosozumab \n\nantibodies was 18.6% (1162 of 6244) for binding antibodies and 0.9% (58 of 6244) for neutralizing \n\nantibodies. The earliest onset of anti-romosozumab antibodies was 3 months after first dosing. The \n\nmajority of antibody responses were transient. \n\nThe presence of anti-romosozumab binding antibodies decreased romosozumab exposure by up to \n\n25%. No impact on the efficacy of romosozumab was observed in the presence of antiromosozumab \n\nantibodies. Limited safety data show that the incidence of injection site reactions was numerically \n\nhigher in female patients with neutralizing antibodies. \n\n \n\nMyocardial infarction, stroke and mortality \n\n \n\nIn the active-controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in \n\npostmenopausal women during the 12-month double-blind romosozumab treatment phase, 16 women \n\n(0.8%) had myocardial infarction in the romosozumab arm versus 5 women (0.2%) in the alendronate \n\narm and 13 women (0.6%) had stroke in the romosozumab arm versus 7 women (0.3%) in the \n\nalendronate arm. These events occurred in patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction \n\nor stroke. Cardiovascular death occurred in 17 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 12 \n\n(0.6%) women in the alendronate group. The number of women with major adverse cardiac events \n\n(MACE = positively adjudicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke) was 41 (2.0%) \n\nin the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) in the alendronate group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.87 \n\n(95% confidence interval [1.11, 3.14]) for romosozumab compared to alendronate. All-cause death \n\noccurred in 30 women (1.5%) in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) women in the alendronate \n\ngroup. \n\nIn the placebo-controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal \n\nwomen (including women with severe and less severe osteoporosis) during the 12-month double-blind \n\nromosozumab treatment phase, there was no difference in positively adjudicated MACE; 30 (0.8%) \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n7 \n\noccurred in the romosozumab group and 29 (0.8%) in the placebo group. All-cause death occurred in \n\n29 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 24 (0.7%) women in the placebo group. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with overdose in clinical trials. There is no known antidote to romosozumab or \n\nspecific treatment for overdose. In case of overdose, it is recommended that patients are monitored \n\nclosely and given appropriate treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, medicinal products \n\naffecting bone structure and mineralization, ATC code: M05BX06. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that binds and inhibits sclerostin, thereby \n\nincreasing bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increasing bone matrix production \n\nby osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. Additionally, romosozumab results in changes \n\nto expression of osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption. Together, this dual effect of \n\nincreasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption results in rapid increases in trabecular and \n\ncortical bone mass, improvements in bone structure, and strength. \n\n  \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, romosozumab increased the bone formation marker \n\nprocollagen Type 1 N terminal propeptide (P1NP) early in treatment, with a peak increase of \n\napproximately 145% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment, followed by a return to \n\nplacebo levels at month 9 and a decline to approximately 15% below placebo at month 12. \n\nRomosozumab decreased the bone resorption marker type-1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) with a \n\nmaximal reduction of approximately 55% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment. CTX \n\nlevels remained below placebo and were approximately 25% below placebo at month 12.  \n\n \n\nAfter discontinuation of romosozumab therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, P1NP \n\nlevels returned to baseline within 12 months; CTX increased above baseline levels within 3 months \n\nand returned toward baseline levels by month 12, reflecting reversibility of effect. Upon retreatment \n\nwith romosozumab (in a limited number of patients) after 12 months placebo treatment, the levels of \n\nincrease in P1NP and decrease in CTX by romosozumab were similar to that observed during the \n\ninitial treatment. \n\n \n\nClinical trial efficacy \n\n \n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of romosozumab was assessed in two pivotal studies, an alendronate-controlled \n\n(ARCH) and a placebo-controlled study (FRAME). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n8 \n\nStudy 20110142 (ARCH) \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of romosozumab in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women \n\nwas evaluated in a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled, \n\nsuperiority study of 4,093 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74.3 years) with \n\nprevious fragility fractures.  \n\n \n\nEnrolled women had either a BMD (Bone Mineral Density) T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of \n\n≤ −2.50, and either at least 1 moderate or severe vertebral fracture; or at least 2 mild vertebral \n\nfractures; or a BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of ≤ -2.00, and either at least 2 moderate \n\nor severe vertebral fractures; or a fracture of the proximal femur that occurred within 3 to 24 months \n\nprior to randomization.  \n\n \n\nThe mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T-scores were -2.96, -2.80, \n\nand -2.90, respectively, 96.1% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline, and 99.0% of women \n\nhad a previous osteoporotic fracture. Women were randomized (1:1) to receive either monthly \n\nsubcutaneous injections of romosozumab or oral weekly alendronate in a blinded fashion for \n\n12 months. After the 12-month double blind study period, women in both arms transitioned to \n\nalendronate while remaining blinded to their initial treatment. The primary analysis was performed \n\nwhen all women had completed the month 24 study visit and clinical fracture events were confirmed \n\nfor at least 330 women and occurred after a median follow-up time of approximately 33 months on \n\nstudy. Women received calcium and vitamin D supplementation daily. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 24 and the \n\nincidence of clinical fracture (nonvertebral fracture and clinical vertebral fracture) at primary analysis.  \n\n \n\nEffect on new vertebral, clinical, nonvertebral, hip and major osteoporotic fractures  \n\nAs shown in Table 1, romosozumab reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 24 \n\n(adjusted p-value < 0.001) and the incidence of clinical fracture at primary analysis (adjusted p-value \n\n< 0.001) as well as the incidence of non vertebral fractures at primary analysis (adjusted p-value = \n\n0.040) versus treatment with alendronate alone. Table 1 also shows nonvertebral, hip and major \n\nosteoporotic fracture risk reduction through primary analysis, month 12 and month 24. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n9 \n\nTable 1.

The trial was not \n\nintended to estimate the effect on fractures but there were seven fractures in the romosozumab arm and \n\nnine fractures in the teriparatide arm of the study. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n11 \n\nBone Histology and Histomorphometry \n\n \n\nIn a bone histology sub-study, a total of 154 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained \n\nfrom 139 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at months 2 and 12 (in FRAME study). \n\nQualitative histology assessments showed normal bone architecture and quality at all time points, \n\nnormal lamellar bone with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, marrow fibrosis, or \n\nclinically significant marrow abnormality in patients treated with romosozumab. \n\nHistomorphometry assessments on biopsies at months 2 and 12 in women showed an increase of bone \n\nformation parameters and a decrease in bone resorption parameters while bone volume and trabecular \n\nthickness were increased in romosozumab group compared to placebo group.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nromosozumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of osteoporosis. \n\nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe median time to maximum romosozumab concentration (tmax) was 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days). \n\nFollowing a 210 mg subcutaneous dose, bioavailability was 81%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nRomosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) with high affinity and specificity for \n\nsclerostin, and therefore is cleared via a rapid saturable elimination pathway (i.e. target mediated \n\nnonlinear clearance, mediated by degradation of the romosozumab-sclerostin complex) and via a slow \n\nnonspecific elimination pathway mediated by the reticuloendothelial system. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter Cmax, serum levels declined with a mean effective half-life of 12.8 days. Steady-state was \n\ngenerally reached by month 3 with less than 2-fold accumulation following monthly dosing.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration, romosozumab exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics as a \n\nresult of binding to sclerostin. Multiple doses administered ranged from 70 to 210 mg. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nFollowing a 210 mg dose of romosozumab in a clinical trial of 16 patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving \n\nhaemodialysis, mean Cmax and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment as compared to healthy subjects. Mean romosozumab exposure was similar in patients \n\nwith ESRD receiving haemodialysis as compared to healthy subjects.  \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing \n\nseverity of renal impairment. However, based on an exposure-response model of BMD changes and \n\ncomparison to exposures obtained at tolerated clinical doses, no dose adjustment is recommended in \n\nthese patients. Monitoring of hypocalcemia in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving \n\ndialysis is recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n12 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nNo clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment. Hepatic \n\nimpairment is not expected to impact on the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab since the liver is not a \n\nmajor organ for romosozumab metabolism or excretion. \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of romosozumab were not affected by age from 20 years to 89 years. \n\n \n\nBodyweight \n\n \n\nRomosozumab exposure decreased with increasing body weight however this decrease had a minimal \n\nimpact on lumbar spine BMD gain based on exposure-response analysis and is not clinically \n\nmeaningful. Based on population PK analyses, the expected median steady state AUC for a 61 kg and \n\n114 kg patient is 558 µg.day/ml and 276 µg.day/ml respectively following a monthly subcutaneous \n\ndose of 210 mg romosozumab. \n\n \n\nEthnicity and gender \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for any patient characteristics. Based on a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, gender and race (Japanese versus non-Japanese) had no clinically \n\nmeaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab (< 20% change in exposure at steady \n\nstate).  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential or in bone safety studies. \n\n \n\nIn a carcinogenicity study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/week were administered by subcutaneous injection to \n\nSprague-Dawley male and female rats from 8 weeks of age for up to 98 weeks. These doses resulted in \n\nsystemic exposures that were up to 19 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans \n\nfollowing a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison). \n\nRomosozumab caused a dose-dependent increase in bone mass with macroscopic bone thickening at \n\nall doses. There were no effects of romosozumab on mortality or tumor incidence in male or female \n\nrats.  \n\n \n\nStudies in female and male rats did not show any romosozumab-related effects on mating, fertility, or \n\nmale reproductive assessments (sperm parameters or organ weights), and there were no effects on \n\nestrous cycling or any ovarian or uterine parameters at exposures around 54 times the clinical \n\nexposure. \n\n \n\nSkeletal malformations, including syndactyly and polydactyly, were observed at a low incidence in 1 \n\nout of 75 litters at exposures around 30 times the clinical exposure following administration of \n\nromosozumab to rats during the period of organogenesis. There were no adverse effects on postnatal \n\ngrowth and development.   \n\n \n\nSclerostin has been suggested to have a role in digit formation, however, as digit formation in the \n\nhuman occurs in the first trimester when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited, the risk of a \n\nsimilar finding in humans is low (see section 4.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n13 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What EVENITY is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat EVENITY is \n\nEVENITY contains the active substance romosozumab, a medicine that helps to make the bones \n\nstronger, and reduce the risk of broken bones.  \n \n\nWhat EVENITY is used for \n\nEVENITY is used to treat severe osteoporosis in women after the menopause who are at high risk of \n\nbroken bone (fracture).  \n\nOsteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile. Many patients with \n\nosteoporosis have no symptoms, but they may be at increased risk of fractures.  \n\n \nHow EVENITY works \n\nEVENITY is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that has been \n\ndesigned to recognize and attach to specific proteins in the body. EVENITY attaches to a protein \n\ncalled sclerostin. By attaching to and blocking the activity of sclerostin, EVENITY:  \n\n helps to form new bone, and \n\n slows down the loss of existing bone. \nThis makes the bones stronger, and lowers the risk of fractures. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n41 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use EVENITY \n\n \n\nDo not use EVENITY if \n\n you are allergic to romosozumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6); \n\n you have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia). Your doctor will be able to tell \nyou if your levels are too low; \n\n you have a history of heart attack or stroke. \n \n\nDo not use EVENITY if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist before using EVENITY. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist and discuss your medical history before using EVENITY. \n\n \n\nHeart attack and stroke \n\nHeart attack and stroke have been reported in people receiving EVENITY.  \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get: \n\n chest pain, shortness of breath; \n\n headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in \n\nvision, loss of balance. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will carefully evaluate the risk of cardiovascular problems before he/she lets you start \n\ntreatment with EVENITY. Tell your doctor if you know that you have an increased risk of \n\ncardiovascular problems such as established cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high blood \n\nfat levels, diabetes, smoking or kidney problems.   \n\n \n\nLow levels of calcium in the blood \n\nEVENITY may cause low levels of calcium in your blood.  \n\nTell your doctor if you notice: \n\n spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles; \n\n numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth.  \n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood \n\nbefore you start your treatment and while you take EVENITY. Take calcium and vitamin D as your \n\ndoctor tells you to.  \n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed \n\ndialysis as this may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do not take calcium \n\nsupplements. \n \n\nSerious allergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic reactions can happen to people who use EVENITY.  \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get: \n\n swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; \n\n acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre \n\n(erythema multiforme); \n\n difficulty in swallowing or breathing. \n \n\nProblems with your mouth, teeth or jaw \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving EVENITY. ONJ can also occur after \n\nstopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing, as it may be a painful condition \n\nthat can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, there are some precautions \n\nyou should take. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n42 \n\nBefore receiving EVENITY, tell your doctor or nurse if you: \n\n have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \nplanned tooth extraction; \n\n do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; \n\n are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); \n\n have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders, \nsuch as osteoporosis); \n\n are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone); \n\n have cancer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with EVENITY. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If \n\nyou wear dentures, you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will \n\nundergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell \n\nyour dentist that you are being treated with EVENITY. \n\n \n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you get any problems with your mouth or teeth such \n\nas: \n\n loose teeth; \n\n pain or swelling; \n\n mouth sores that do not heal; \n\n discharge. \n \n\nUnusual thigh bone fractures \n\nPeople who have used EVENITY rarely developed unusual fractures of the thigh bone caused by little \n\nor no trauma. These fracture types are often preceded by warning signs of thigh or groin pain for \n\nseveral weeks before the fracture occurs. It is not known whether EVENITY caused these unusual \n\nfractures. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any new or unusual pains in your hip, groin or \n\nthigh.  \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of romosozumab in children and adolescents has not been studied and it is not approved for \n\nuse in paediatric patients (age <18 years). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and EVENITY \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nEVENITY is only intended to treat women after menopause.  \n\nEVENITY should not be used by women of child-bearing potential, or when pregnant or breast-\n\nfeeding. It is not known whether EVENITY may harm an unborn or breast-fed child.  \n\nContact your doctor if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nEVENITY is expected to have no effect or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nEVENITY contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n43 \n\n3. How to use EVENITY \n\n \n\nEVENITY will be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management of \n\nosteoporosis. Always use this medicine exactly as you doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\nThe injection should only be given by a person who has been properly trained.  \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\n The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg. \n\n Since one pre-filled pen contains 105 mg of the active substance romosozumab in 1.17 ml of \nsolution (90mg/ml), 2 pre-filled pens must be used for each dose. The second injection must be \n\ngiven immediately after the first one but at a different injection site.   \n\n Do this once every month for 12 months. \n \n\nHow to use \n\n EVENITY has to be injected under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection). \n\n EVENITY should be injected in either the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. The outer area of \nyour upper arm can also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the \n\ninjection.   \n\n If the same injection area is planned to be used for the second injection, a different injection \nspot should be used.  \n\n EVENITY should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.  \n\n \n\nIt is important that you read the Instructions for Use for detailed information on how to use the \n\nEVENITY pre-filled pen.  \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you have any further questions on the use of the medicine.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more EVENITY than you should \n\nIf, by mistake, you have used more EVENITY than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use or cannot take EVENITY at your usual time \n\nIf you miss a dose of EVENITY, contact your doctor as soon as possible to schedule another dose. \n\nThereafter, the next dose should be given not earlier than one month after the date of the last dose.  \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking EVENITY \n\nIf you are considering stopping EVENITY treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor \n\nwill advise you on how long you should be treated with EVENITY. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nDiscuss with your doctor the need to switch to another osteoporosis treatment after the end of your \n\ntreatment with EVENITY. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get any of the following possible symptoms of heart \n\nattack or stroke (uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n chest pain, shortness of breath;  \n\n headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in \n\nvision, loss of balance. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n44 \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get the following symptoms of a serious allergic \n\nreaction (rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; \n\n acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre \n\n(erythema multiforme); \n\n difficulty in swallowing or breathing. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you notice the following symptoms of low levels of calcium in the blood \n\n(hypocalcaemia) (uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles; \n\n numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth. \n\n \n\nSee also section 2 “What you need to know before you use EVENITY”.  \n\n \n\nOther side effects may include:  \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \n\n Common cold;  \n\n Joint pain.  \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n Rash, inflammation of the skin;  \n\n Headache; \n\n Sinusitis; \n\n Neck pain; \n\n Muscle spasms; \n\n Redness or pain around the site where the injection was given.  \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n Hives (urticaria); \n\n Cataract. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

This will make the \n\ninjection more comfortable. \n\n Open the carton and gather all materials you need for the injection (as listed in Step B). \n\n Wash your hands thoroughly. \n\n Lift the pre-filled pens straight up out of the carton − do not remove the white caps from the pre-\nfilled pens yet. \n\n Do not shake the pre-filled pens. \n\n Check the medicine through the viewing window. The medicine should be a clear to opalescent,  \ncolourless to light yellow solution. \n\n- Do not use the pre-filled pens if the solution is discoloured, cloudy, or contains flakes or \nparticles. \n\n- You may see air bubbles. Injecting the solution subcutaneously (under the skin) which  \ncontains air bubbles is harmless. \n\n Do not use the pre-filled pens if: \n\n- it has been dropped; \n- the white cap is missing or not securely attached; \n- the seal is missing or broken or if any other part appears cracked or broken. \n\nIn such case, use a new pen and contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nB On a clean, well-lit work surface, place: \n\n  two pre-filled pens; \n\n two alcohol wipes; \n\n two cotton balls or gauze pads; \n\n two adhesives bandages; \n\n special disposal container. \n\n \n\n \n\nC Prepare and clean the skin where you are going to inject the medicine. You can choose from: \n\n  the thighs; \n\n the stomach area (abdomen), but not the 5 cm area \naround the belly button; \n\n the outer area of the upper arm (if someone else is \ngiving you the injection). \n\n \n \n\n The second injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If \nyou wish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot. \n\n Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, has scars, or stretch marks, or \nhas raised thick, red, or scaly skin patches or lesions.  \n\n \n\n Clean the area you are going to inject with an alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before the injection. \n \n\nOuter area of  \n\nupper arm \n\nStomach area    \n\n(abdomen) \n\nThigh \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Do not touch this area again before injecting. \n\n \n\nStep 2:  Get ready \n\nD  Pull the white cap straight off just before the injection.  \n\n Once the cap is removed, the injection must be given within 5 minutes. There is no need to rush \nthe injection - 5 minutes is enough time. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Do not twist or bend the white cap. \n \n\n Discard the white cap in the special disposal container. Do not place the white cap back onto \nthe pre-filled pen. \n\n \n\n Although hidden from view, the needle tip is now uncovered. Do not try to touch the needle as \nit could activate the pre-filled pen.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What EVENITY is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat EVENITY is \n\nEVENITY contains the active substance romosozumab, a medicine that helps to make the bones \n\nstronger, and reduce the risk of broken bones.  \n\n \n\nWhat EVENITY is used for \n\nEVENITY is used to treat severe osteoporosis in women after the menopause who are at high risk of \n\nbroken bone (fracture).  \n\nOsteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile. Many patients with \n\nosteoporosis have no symptoms, but they may be at increased risk of fractures.  \n \n\nHow EVENITY works \n\nEVENITY is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that has been \n\ndesigned to recognize and attach to specific proteins in the body. EVENITY attaches to a protein \n\ncalled sclerostin. By attaching to and blocking the activity of sclerostin, EVENITY:  \n\n helps to form new bone, and \n\n slows down the loss of existing bone. \nThis makes the bones stronger, and lowers the risk of fractures. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use EVENITY  \n \n\nDo not use EVENITY if: \n\n you are allergic to romosozumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6); \n\n you have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia). Your doctor will be able to tell \nyou if your levels are too low; \n\n you have history of heart attack or stroke. \n \n\nDo not use EVENITY if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist before using EVENITY. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist and discuss your medical history before using EVENITY. \n\n \n\nHeart attack and stroke \n\nHeart attack and stroke have been reported in people receiving EVENITY.  \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get: \n\n chest pain, shortness of breath; \n\n headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in \nvision, loss of balance. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will carefully evaluate the risk of cardiovascular problems before he/she lets you start \n\ntreatment with EVENITY. Tell your doctor if you know that you have an increased risk of \n\ncardiovascular problems such as established cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high blood \n\nfat levels, diabetes, smoking or kidney problems.   \n\n \n\nLow levels of calcium in the blood \n\nEVENITY may cause low levels of calcium in your blood.  \n\nTell your doctor if you notice: \n\n spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles;  \n\n numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth.  \n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood \n\nbefore you start your treatment and while you take EVENITY. Take calcium and vitamin D as your \n\ndoctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney \n\nfailure or have needed dialysis as this may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do \n\nnot take calcium supplements.  \n\n \n\nSerious allergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic reactions can happen to people who use EVENITY.  \n\nSeek medical attention straight away if you get: \n\n swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; \n\n acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre \n\n(erythema multiforme); \n\n difficulty in swallowing or breathing. \n \n\nProblems with your mouth, teeth or jaw \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving EVENITY. ONJ can also occur after \n\nstopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing as it may be a painful condition \n\nthat can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, there are some precautions \n\nyou should take. \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n56 \n\nBefore receiving EVENITY, tell your doctor or nurse if you: \n\n have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \nplanned tooth extraction; \n\n do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; \n\n are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); \n\n have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders, \nsuch as osteoporosis); \n\n are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone); \n\n have cancer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with EVENITY. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If \n\nyou wear dentures, you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will \n\nundergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell \n\nyour dentist that you are being treated with EVENITY. \n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you get any problems with your mouth or teeth such \n\nas: \n\n loose teeth; \n\n pain or swelling; \n\n mouth sores that do not heal; \n\n discharge. \n\n \n\nUnusual thigh bone fractures \n\nPeople who have used EVENITY, rarely developed unusual fractures of the thigh bone  caused by \n\nlittle or no trauma. These fracture types are often proceded by warning signs of thigh or groin pain for \n\nseveral weeks before the fracture occurs. It is not known whether EVENITY caused these unusual \n\nfractures. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any new or unusual pains in your hip, groin or \n\nthigh.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of EVENITY in children and adolescents has not been studied.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and EVENITY \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nEVENITY is only intended to treat women after menopause.  \n\nEVENITY should not be used by women of child-bearing potential, or when pregnant or breast-\n\nfeeding. It is not known whether EVENITY may harm an unborn or breast-fed child.  \n\nContact your doctor if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nEVENITY is expected to have no effect or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nEVENITY contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- \n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n57 \n\n3. How to use EVENITY \n\n  \n\nEVENITY will be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management of \n\nosteoporosis. Always use this medicine exactly as you doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\nThe injection should only be given by a person who has been properly trained.  \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\n The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg. \n\n Since one pre-filled syringe contains 105 mg of the active substance romosozumab, 2 pre-filled \nsyringes must be used for each dose. The second injection must be given immediately after the \n\nfirst one but at a different injection site.   \n\n Do this once every month for 12 months.  \n \n\nHow to use \n\n EVENITY has to be injected under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection). \n\n EVENITY should be injected in either the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. The outer area of \nyour upper arm can also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the \n\ninjection.   \n\n If the same injection area is planned to be used for the second injection, a different injection \nspot should be used.  \n\n EVENITY should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.  \n\n \n\nIt is important that you read the Instructions for Use for detailed information on how to use the \n\nEVENITY pre-filled syringe.  \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you have any further questions on the use of the medicine.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more EVENITY than you should \n\nIf, by mistake, you have used more EVENITY than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use or cannot take EVENITY at your usual time \nIf you miss a dose of EVENITY, contact your doctor as soon as possible to schedule another dose. \n\nThereafter, the next dose should be given not earlier than one month after the date of the last dose.  \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking EVENITY \n\nIf you are considering stopping EVENITY treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor \n\nwill advise you on how long you should be treated with EVENITY. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nDiscuss with your doctor the need to switch to another osteoporosis treatment after the end of your \n\ntreatment with EVENITY. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

This will make \n\nthe injection more comfortable. \n\n \n\n Open the carton and gather all the materials you need for the injection (as listed in Step B). \n \n\n Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n\n Remove two pre-filled syringes from the carton as shown in the picture. \n\n \n\n Important: Always hold the pre-filled syringes by the syringe barrel. \n \n\n Place finger or thumb on edge of tray to secure it while you remove the pre-filled syringes.  \n \n\n Grab the syringe barrel to remove the pre-filled syringes from the tray. \n\n \n \n\n \n Do not grasp the plunger rod or the grey needle cap. \n \n\n Do not remove the grey cap from the pre-filled syringes yet. \n \n\n Do not remove the finger flange. This is part of the pre-filled syringe. \n \n\n Do not shake the pre-filled syringes. \n \n\n Check the medicine in the syringes. The medicine should be a clear to opalescent, colourless to \nlight yellow solution. \n\n-  Do not use the pre-filled syringes if the solution is discoloured, cloudy, or contains flakes \nor particles. \n\n-  You may see air bubbles. Injecting the solution subcutaneously (under the skin) which \ncontains air bubbles is harmless. \n\nGrab Here \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n63 \n\n  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if: \n-  it has been dropped; \n-  if the grey needle cap is missing or not securely attached; \n-  if the seal is missing or broken or if any part appears cracked or broken. \n\nIn such case, use a new syringe and contact your doctor as soon as possible.  \n\n \n\nB On a clean, well-lit work surface, place: \n\n  two pre-filled syringes; \n\n two alcohol wipes; \n\n two cotton balls or gauze pads; \n\n two adhesives bandages; \n\n special disposal container. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nC Prepare and clean the skin where you are going to inject the medicine. You can choose from: \n\n  \n\n the thighs; \n\n the stomach area (abdomen), but not the 5 cm area \naround the belly button; \n\n the outer area of the upper arm (if someone else is \ngiving you the injection). \n\n  \n\n  \n  The second injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If \n\nyou wish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot. \n\n \n\n Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, has scars, or stretch marks, or \nhas raised thick, red, or scaly skin patches or lesions \n\n \n\n Clean the area you are going to inject with an alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before the injection. \n\n \n\n Do not touch this area again before injecting. \n \n\nStep 2:  Get ready \n\nD  Pull the grey needle cap straight off and away from the body just before the injection.  \n\n- Take care not to touch the needle or let the needle touch any surface.  \n\n Once the cap is removed, the injection must be given within 5 minutes. There is no need to rush \nthe injection - 5 minutes is enough time. \n\n- It is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. \n\nOuter area of  \nupper arm \n\nStomach area    \n\n(abdomen) \n\nThigh \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Do not twist or bend the grey needle cap. \n\n \n\n Discard the grey needle cap in the special disposal container. Do not place the grey needle cap \nback onto the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\nE  Pinch skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating a firm surface about 5 cm wide. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  Important: Keep the skin pinched while injecting. \n \n\n \n\nStep 3:  Inject \n\nF  Important: The plunger rod should not be pushed down until the actual injection is ready to be \nperformed. \n\n \n\n The pinch should be held. With the other hand, the pre-filled syringe’s needle should be inserted \ninto the area of the skin that previously has been cleaned (the “injection site”) at a 45 to \n\n90° degree angle. \n\n \n\n Finger should not be placed on the plunger rod while inserting the needle. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n65 \n\nG  Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod all the way down until it stops moving \nindicating the entire dose has been delivered. The pre-filled syringe should be kept in the skin \n\nwhile completing the dose delivery. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nH  Once complete, release your thumb and gently lift the pre-filled syringe off the skin at the same \nangle at which it was inserted. \n\n- After you remove the pre-filled syringe from the skin, the syringe barrel should be empty. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Important: If it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not \ndelivered a full injection. Your healthcare provider should be informed as soon as possible. \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 4:  Dispose \n\nI  Discard the entire used pre-filled syringe and the grey needle \ncap in a special container straight away after use. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Do not throw away (dispose of) the pre-filled syringe in the household waste. \n\n \n\n Do not re-use the pre-filled syringe. \n \n\n Important: Always keep the special disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. \n \n\n \n\nStep 5:  Examine the injection site \n\nJ If there is blood, use a cotton ball or piece of gauze and apply light pressure over the injection site \n\nfor a few seconds. Do not rub the injection site. The injection site can be covered with a small \n\nadhesive bandage, if necessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDraft \n\n \n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nStep 6:  Repeat for the second injection to get the full dose \n\nK Repeat all steps starting from step C with the second pre-filled syringe to inject the full dose. The \n\nsecond injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If you \n\nwish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n+ \n\n \n\n \n \n\n= 1 dose \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
