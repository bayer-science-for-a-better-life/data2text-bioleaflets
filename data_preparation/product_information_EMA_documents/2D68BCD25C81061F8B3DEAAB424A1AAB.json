If a full treatment response is subsequently \n\nachieved, the intensified dosing regimen of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) every \n\n4 weeks should be maintained. \n\n \n\nContinued treatment with canakinumab in patients without clinical improvement should be \n\nreconsidered by the treating physician. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nThe recommended dose of canakinumab for patients with Still’s disease with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg is \n\n4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 300 mg) administered every four weeks via subcutaneous injection. \n\nContinued treatment with canakinumab in patients without clinical improvement should be \n\nreconsidered by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nManagement of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or \n\noptimised. Canakinumab should be used as an on-demand therapy to treat gouty arthritis attacks. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of canakinumab for adult patients with gouty arthritis is 150 mg administered \n\nsubcutaneously as a single dose during an attack. For maximum effect, canakinumab should be \n\nadministered as soon as possible after the onset of a gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients  \nwith body weight > 40 kg \n\nMaintenance \ndose: 150 mg \nevery 4 weeks \n\nAdditional dose of \n150 mg can be \n\nconsidered \n\n150 mg \n\nMaintenance \ndose 2 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks \n\nAdditional dose \nof 2 mg/kg can \nbe considered \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\n2 mg/kg \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients  \n\nwith body weight  7.5 kg and ≤ 40 kg \n\nIf full treatment response is \nachieved, maintenance dose: \n\n4 mg/kg every 4 weeks \n\nNo \n \n\nNo Yes Yes \n \n\nIf full treatment response is \nachieved, maintenance dose: \n\n300 mg every 4 weeks \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients who do not respond to initial treatment should not be re-treated with canakinumab. In patients \n\nwho respond and require re-treatment, there should be an interval of at least 12 weeks before a new \n\ndose of canakinumab may be administered (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nThe safety and efficacy of canakinumab in CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients under \n\n2 years of age have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nSJIA \n\nThe safety and efficacy of canakinumab in SJIA patients under 2 years of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nThere is no relevant use of canakinumab in the paediatric population in the indication gouty arthritis. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nCanakinumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, clinical experience in such \n\npatients is limited. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous use. \n\nThe following are suitable injection sites: upper thigh, abdomen, upper arm or buttocks. It is \n\nrecommended to select a different injection site each time the product is injected to avoid soreness. \n\nBroken skin and areas which are bruised or covered by a rash should be avoided. Injection into scar \n\ntissue should be avoided as this may result in insufficient exposure to canakinumab. \n\n \n\nEach vial is for single use in a single patient, for a single dose. \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in the correct injection technique, patients or their caregivers may inject \n\ncanakinumab if the physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary \n\n(see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nCanakinumab is associated with an increased incidence of serious infections. Therefore patients \n\nshould be monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment with \n\ncanakinumab. Physicians should exercise caution when administering canakinumab to patients with \n\ninfections, a history of recurring infections, or underlying conditions which may predispose them to \n\ninfections. \n\n \n\nTreatment of CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nCanakinumab should not be initiated or continued in patients during an active infection requiring \n\nmedical intervention. \n\n \n\nTreatment of gouty arthritis \n\nCanakinumab should not be administered during an active infection. \n\nConcomitant use of canakinumab with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended \n\nbecause this may increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections (including aspergillosis, atypical mycobacterial \n\ninfections, herpes zoster) have been reported during canakinumab treatment. The causal relationship of \n\ncanakinumab to these events cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis screening \n\n \n\nIn approximately 12% of CAPS patients tested with a PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test in \n\nclinical trials, follow-up testing yielded a positive test result while treated with canakinumab without \n\nclinical evidence of a latent or active tuberculosis infection. \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether the use of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors such as canakinumab increases the risk \n\nof reactivation of tuberculosis. Before initiation of therapy, all patients must be evaluated for both \n\nactive and latent tuberculosis infection. Particularly in adult patients, this evaluation should include a \n\ndetailed medical history. Appropriate screening tests (e.g. tuberculin skin test, interferon gamma \n\nrelease assay or chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). \n\nPatients must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis during and after treatment \n\nwith canakinumab. All patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms \n\nsuggestive of tuberculosis (e.g. persistent cough, weight loss, subfebrile temperature) appear during \n\ncanakinumab therapy. In the event of conversion from a negative to a positive PPD test, especially in \n\nhigh-risk patients, alternative means of screening for a tuberculosis infection should be considered. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and leukopenia \n\n \n\nNeutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1.5 x 109/l) and leukopenia have been observed with \n\nmedicinal products that inhibit IL-1, including canakinumab. Treatment with canakinumab should not \n\nbe initiated in patients with neutropenia or leukopenia. It is recommended that white blood cell (WBC) \n\ncounts including neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to \n\n2 months. For chronic or repeated therapies, it is also recommended to assess WBC counts \n\nperiodically during treatment. If a patient becomes neutropenic or leukopenic, the WBC counts should \n\nbe monitored closely and treatment discontinuation should be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nMalignancies \n\n \n\nMalignancy events have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab. The risk for the \n\ndevelopment of malignancies with anti-interleukin (IL)-1 therapy is unknown. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions with canakinumab therapy have been reported. The majority of these events \n\nwere mild in severity. During clinical development of canakinumab in over 2,600 patients, no \n\nanaphylactoid or anaphylactic reactions attributable to treatment with canakinumab were reported. \n\nHowever, the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, which is not uncommon for injectable proteins, \n\ncannot be excluded (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n\n \n\nTransient and asymptomatic cases of elevations of serum transaminases or bilirubin have been \n\nreported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the risk of secondary transmission of infection by live (attenuated) vaccines \n\nin patients receiving canakinumab. Therefore, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with \n\ncanakinumab unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of canakinumab therapy it is recommended that adult and paediatric patients receive \n\nall vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMutation in NLRP3 gene in CAPS patients \n\n \n\nClinical experience in CAPS patients without a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene is limited. \n\n \n\nMacrophage activation syndrome in patients with Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in \n\npatients with rheumatic conditions, in particular Still’s disease. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, \n\nevaluation and treatment should be started as early as possible. Physicians should be attentive to \n\nsymptoms of infection or worsening of Still’s disease, as these are known triggers for MAS. Based on \n\nclinical trial experience, canakinumab does not appear to increase the incidence of MAS in Still’s \n\ndisease patients, but no definitive conclusion can be made. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInteractions between canakinumab and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nAn increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 \n\nblocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Use of canakinumab with TNF inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections. \n\n \n\nThe expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by the cytokines that stimulate \n\nchronic inflammation, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Thus, CYP450 expression may be \n\nreversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as canakinumab, is introduced. This is \n\nclinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index where the dose is \n\nindividually adjusted. On initiation of canakinumab in patients being treated with this type of \n\nmedicinal product, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or of the active substance concentration should \n\nbe performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as necessary. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nNo data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of \n\ninfection by live vaccines in patients receiving canakinumab. Therefore, live vaccines should not be \n\ngiven concurrently with canakinumab unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Should \n\nvaccination with live vaccines be indicated after initiation of canakinumab treatment, the \n\nrecommendation is to wait for at least 3 months after the last canakinumab injection and before the \n\nnext one (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe results of a study in healthy adult subjects demonstrated that a single dose of canakinumab \n\n300 mg did not affect the induction and persistence of antibody responses after vaccination with \n\ninfluenza or glycosylated protein based meningococcus vaccines. \n\n \n\nThe results of a 56-week, open label study in CAPS patients aged 4 years and younger demonstrated \n\nthat all patients who received non-live, standard of care childhood vaccinations developed protective \n\nantibody levels. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen should use effective contraceptives during treatment with canakinumab and for up to \n\n3 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of canakinumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do \n\nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nThe risk for the foetus/mother is unknown. Women who are pregnant or who desire to become \n\npregnant should therefore only be treated after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate that canakinumab crosses the placenta and is detectable in the foetus. No \n\nhuman data are available, but as canakinumab is an immunoglobulin of the G class (IgG1), human \n\ntransplacental transfer is expected. The clinical impact of this is unknown. However, administration of \n\nlive vaccines to newborn infants exposed to canakinumab in utero is not recommended for 16 weeks \n\nfollowing the mother’s last dose of canakinumab before childbirth. Women who received \n\ncanakinumab during pregnancy should be instructed to inform the baby’s healthcare professional \n\nbefore any vaccinations are given to their newborn infant. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether canakinumab is excreted in human milk. The decision whether to breast-feed \n\nduring canakinumab therapy should therefore only be taken after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have shown that a murine anti-murine IL-1 beta antibody had no undesirable effects on \n\ndevelopment in nursing mouse pups and that the antibody was transferred to them (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFormal studies of the potential effect of canakinumab on human fertility have not been conducted. \n\nCanakinumab had no effect on male fertility parameters in marmosets (C. jacchus). A murine anti-\n\nmurine IL-1 beta antibody had no undesirable effects on fertility in male or female mice (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nIlaris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Treatment with Ilaris may result in \n\ndizziness/vertigo or asthenia (see section 4.8). Patients who experience such symptoms during Ilaris \n\ntreatment should wait for this to resolve completely before driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions were infections predominantly of the upper respiratory tract. \n\nNo impact on the type or frequency of adverse drug reactions was seen with longer-term treatment. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 4.4). \n\n \n\nOpportunistic infections have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ \n\nclass, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency category with the most common first. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 1 Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nIndications: \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF, SJIA, gouty arthritis \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common Respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza, viral \n\ninfection, sinusitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection) \n\nEar infection \n\nCellulitis \n\nGastroenteritis \n\nUrinary tract infection \n\nCommon Vulvovaginal candidiasis \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Dizziness/vertigo \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Upper abdominal pain 1 \n\nUncommon Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common Injection site reaction \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Arthralgia 1 \n\nCommon Musculoskeletal pain 1 \n\nBack pain 2 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue/asthenia 2 \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common Creatinine renal clearance decreased 1,3 \n\nProteinuria 1,4 \n\nLeukopenia 1,5 \n\nCommon Neutropenia 5 \n\nUncommon Platelet count decreased 5 \n1 In SJIA \n2 In gouty arthritis \n3 Based on estimated creatinine clearance, most were transient \n4 Most represented transient trace to 1+ positive urinary protein by dipstick \n5 See further information below \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nStill’s Disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nSJIA pooled analysis and AOSD \n\nA total of 445 SJIA patients aged 2 to < 20 years received canakinumab in clinical trials, including \n\n321 patients aged 2 to < 12 years, 88 patients aged 12 to < 16 years, and 36 patients aged 16 to \n\n< 20 years. A pooled safety analysis of all SJIA patients showed that in the subset of young adult SJIA \n\npatients aged 16 to < 20 years, the safety profile of canakinumab was consistent with what was \n\nobserved in SJIA patients less than 16 years of age. The safety profile of canakinumab in AOSD \n\npatients in a randomised, double blind placebo-controlled study (GDE01T) in 36 adult patients (aged \n\n22 to 70 years) was similar to what was observed in SJIA patients. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nLong-term data and laboratory abnormalities in CAPS patients \n\nDuring clinical trials with canakinumab in CAPS patients mean values for haemoglobin increased and \n\nthose for white blood cell, neutrophils and platelets decreased. \n\n \n\nElevations of transaminases have been observed rarely in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nAsymptomatic and mild elevations of serum bilirubin have been observed in CAPS patients treated \n\nwith canakinumab without concomitant elevations of transaminases. \n\n \n\nIn the long-term, open-label studies with dose escalation, events of infections (gastroenteritis, \n\nrespiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection), vomiting and dizziness were more \n\nfrequently reported in the 600 mg or 8 mg/kg dose group than in other dose groups. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients \n\nNeutrophils \n\nAlthough ≥ Grade 2 reductions in neutrophil count occurred in 6.5% of patients (common) and \n\nGrade 1 reductions occurred in 9.5% of patients, the reductions are generally transient and \n\nneutropenia-associated infection has not been identified as an adverse reaction. \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nAlthough reductions in platelet count (≥ Grade 2) occurred in 0.6% of patients, bleeding has not been \n\nidentified as an adverse reaction. Mild and transient Grade 1 reduction in platelets occurred in 15.9% \n\nof patients without any associated bleeding adverse events. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in SJIA patients \n\nHaematology \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts ≤ 0.8 x LLN were \n\nreported in 33 patients (16.5%). \n\n \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreases in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to less than 1 x \n\n109/l were reported in 12 patients (6.0%). \n\n \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreases in platelet counts (< LLN) were observed in \n\n19 patients (9.5%). \n\n \n\nALT/AST \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, high ALT and/or AST > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were \n\nreported in 19 patients (9.5%). \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in gouty arthritis patients \n\nHaematology \n\nDecreased white blood cell counts (WBC) ≤ 0.8 x lower limit of normal (LLN) were reported in 6.7% \n\nof patients treated with canakinumab compared to 1.4% treated with triamcinolone acetonide. \n\nDecreases in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) to less than 1 x 109/l were reported in 2% of patients in \n\nthe comparative trials. Isolated cases of ANC counts < 0.5 x 109/l were also observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMild (< LLN and > 75 x 109/l) and transient decreases in platelet counts were observed at a higher \n\nincidence (12.7%) with canakinumab in the active-controlled clinical studies versus the comparator \n\n(7.7%) in gouty arthritis patients. \n\n \n\nUric acid \n\nIncreases in uric acid level (0.7 mg/dl at 12 weeks and 0.5 mg/dl at 24 weeks) were observed after \n\ncanakinumab treatment in comparative trials in gouty arthritis. In another study, among patients who \n\nwere starting on ULT, increases in uric acid were not observed. Uric acid increases were not observed \n\nin clinical trials in non-gouty arthritis populations (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nALT/AST \n\nMean and median increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3.0 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, and in \n\naspartate transaminase (AST) of 2.7 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, from baseline to end of study were \n\nseen in the canakinumab-treated groups versus the triamcinolone acetonide-treated group(s), however \n\nthe incidence of clinically significant changes (≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal) was greater for patients \n\ntreated with triamcinolone acetonide (2.5% for both AST and ALT) compared with canakinumab-\n\ntreated patients (1.6% for ALT and 0.8% for AST). \n\n \n\nTriglycerides \n\nIn active-controlled gouty arthritis trials, there was a mean increase in triglycerides of 33.5 mg/dl in \n\ncanakinumab-treated patients compared with a modest decrease of -3.1 mg/dl with triamcinolone \n\nacetonide. The incidence of patients with triglyceride elevations > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) \n\nwas 2.4% with canakinumab and 0.7% with triamcinolone acetonide. The clinical significance of this \n\nobservation is unknown. \n\n \n\nLong term data from observational study \n\n \n\nA total of 243 CAPS patients (85 paediatric patients aged ≥ 2 to ≤ 17 years and 158 adult patients aged \n\n≥ 18 years) were treated with canakinumab in routine clinical practice in a long-term registry study \n\n(mean of 3.8 years of canakinumab exposure). The safety profile of canakinumab observed following \n\nlong-term treatment in this setting was consistent with what has been observed in interventional \n\nstudies in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThere were 80 paediatric CAPS patients (2-17 years of age) who received canakinumab in the \n\ninterventional studies. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and \n\ntolerability profile of canakinumab in paediatric patients compared to the overall CAPS population \n\n(comprised of adult and paediatric patients, N=211), including the overall frequency and severity of \n\ninfectious episodes. Infections of the upper respiratory tract were the most frequently reported \n\ninfection events. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, 6 paediatric patients under the age of 2 years were evaluated in a small open-label \n\nclinical study. The safety profile of canakinumab appeared similar to that in patients aged 2 years and \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nThere were 102 TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients (2-17 years of age) who received \n\ncanakinumab in a 16-week study. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety \n\nand tolerability profile of canakinumab in paediatric patients compared to the overall population. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nElderly population \n\n \n\nThere is no significant difference in safety profile observed in patients ≥ 65 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nReported experience with overdose is limited. In early clinical trials, patients and healthy volunteers \n\nreceived doses as high as 10 mg/kg, administered intravenously or subcutaneously, without evidence \n\nof acute toxicity. \n\n \n\nIn case of overdose, it is recommended for the patient to be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \n\nadverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCanakinumab is a human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) antibody of the \n\nIgG1/κ isotype. Canakinumab binds with high affinity specifically to human IL-1 beta and neutralises \n\nthe biological activity of human IL-1 beta by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, thereby \n\npreventing IL-1 beta-induced gene activation and the production of inflammatory mediators. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nIn clinical studies, CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients who have uncontrolled over-\n\nproduction of IL-1 beta show a rapid and sustained response to therapy with canakinumab, i.e. \n\nlaboratory parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), high \n\nneutrophil and platelet counts, and leukocytosis rapidly returned to normal. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nAdult-onset Still’s disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis are severe autoinflammatory \n\ndiseases, driven by innate immunity by means of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a key one being IL-1-\n\nbeta. \n\n \n\nCommon features of SJIA and AOSD include fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, \n\npolyserositis and arthritis. Treatment with canakinumab resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement \n\nof both the articular and the systemic features of SJIA with significant reduction of the number of \n\ninflamed joints, prompt resolution of fever and reduction of acute phase reactants in the majority of \n\npatients (see Clinical efficacy and safety). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nA gouty arthritis attack is caused by urate (monosodium urate monohydrate) crystals in the joint and \n\nsurrounding tissue, which trigger resident macrophages to produce IL-1 beta via the “NALP3 \n\ninflammasome” complex. Activation of macrophages and concomitant over-production of IL-1 beta \n\nresults in an acute painful inflammatory response. Other activators of the innate immune system, such \n\nas endogenous agonists of toll-like receptors, may contribute to the transcriptional activation of the IL-\n\n1 beta gene, initiating a gouty arthritis attack. Following canakinumab treatment, the inflammatory \n\nmarkers CRP or SAA and signs of acute inflammation (e.g. pain, swelling, redness) in the affected \n\njoint subside rapidly. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nCAPS \n\nThe efficacy and safety of canakinumab have been demonstrated in a total of 211 adult and paediatric \n\npatients with varying degrees of disease severity and different CAPS phenotypes (including \n\nFCAS/FCU, MWS, and NOMID/CINCA). Only patients with confirmed NLRP3 mutation were \n\nincluded in the pivotal study. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase I/II study, treatment with canakinumab had a rapid onset of action, with disappearance or \n\nclinically significant improvement of symptoms within one day after dosing. Laboratory parameters \n\nsuch as high CRP and SAA, high neutrophils and platelet counts normalised rapidly within days of \n\ncanakinumab injection. \n\n \n\nThe pivotal study consisted of a 48-week three-part multicentre study, i.e. an 8-week open-label period \n\n(Part I), a 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II), followed \n\nby a 16-week open-label period (Part III). The aim of the study was to assess efficacy, safety, and \n\ntolerability of canakinumab (150 mg or 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) in patients with CAPS. \n\n \n\n Part I: A complete clinical and biomarker response to canakinumab (defined as composite of \nphysician’s global assessment on autoinflammatory and on skin disease ≤ minimal and CRP or \n\nSAA values < 10 mg/litre) was observed in 97% of patients and appeared within 7 days of \n\ninitiation of treatment. Significant improvements were seen in physician’s clinical assessment of \n\nautoinflammatory disease activity: global assessment of autoinflammatory disease activity, \n\nassessment of skin disease (urticarial skin rash), arthralgia, myalgia, headache/migraine, \n\nconjunctivitis, fatigue/malaise, assessment of other related symptoms, and patient’s assessment \n\nof symptoms. \n\n \n\n Part II: In the withdrawal period of the pivotal study, the primary endpoint was defined as the \nproportion of patients with a disease relapse/flare: none (0%) of the patients randomised to \n\ncanakinumab flared, compared with 81% of the patients randomised to placebo. \n\n \n\n Part III: Patients treated with placebo in Part II who flared regained and maintained clinical and \nserological response following entry into the open-label canakinumab extension. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 2 Tabulated summary of efficacy in Phase III trial, pivotal placebo-controlled \n\nwithdrawal period (Part II) \n\n \n\nPhase III trial, pivotal placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II) \n\n Canakinumab \n\nN=15 \n\nn(%) \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=16 \n\nn(%) \n\n \n\np-value \n\n \n\nPrimary endpoint (flare) \n Proportion of patients with disease flare in Part II 0 (0%) 13 (81%) < 0.001 \n\n \n\nInflammatory markers* \n C-reactive protein, mg/l 1.10 (0.40) 19.93 (10.50) < 0.001 \n\n Serum amyloid A, mg/l 2.27 (-0.20) 71.09 (14.35) 0.002 \n\n* mean (median) change from beginning of Part II \n\n \n\nTwo open-label, uncontrolled, long-term phase III studies were performed. One was a safety, \n\ntolerability, and efficacy study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. The total treatment duration \n\nranged from 6 months to 2 years. The other was an open-label study with canakinumab to evaluate the \n\nefficacy and safety in Japanese CAPS patients for 24 weeks, with an extension phase up to 48 weeks. \n\nThe primary objective was to assess the proportion of patients who were free of relapse at week 24, \n\nincluding those patients whose dose was increased. \n\n \n\nIn the pooled efficacy analysis for these two studies, 65.6% of patients who had not previously been \n\ntreated with canakinumab achieved complete response at 150 mg or 2 mg/kg, while 85.2% of patients \n\nachieved complete response at any dose. Of the patients treated with 600 mg or 8 mg/kg (or even \n\nhigher), 43.8% achieved complete response. Fewer patients aged 2 to < 4 years achieved complete \n\nresponse (57.1%) than older paediatric and adult patients. Of the patients who had achieved a \n\ncomplete response, 89.3% maintained response without relapsing. \n\n \n\nExperience from individual patients who achieved a complete response following dose escalation to \n\n600 mg (8 mg/kg) every 8 weeks suggests that a higher dose may be beneficial in patients not \n\nachieving complete response or not maintaining complete response with the recommended doses \n\n(150 mg or 2 mg/kg for patients ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg). An increased dose was administered more \n\nfrequently to patients aged 2 to < 4 years and to patients with NOMID/CINCA symptoms compared \n\nwith FCAS or MWS. \n\n \n\nA 6-year observational registry study was conducted to provide data on the long-term safety and \n\neffectiveness of canakinumab treatment in paediatric and adult CAPS patients in routine clinical \n\npractice. The study included 243 CAPS patients (including 85 patients less than 18 years of age). \n\nDisease activity was rated as absent or mild/moderate in more than 90% of patients at all post-baseline \n\ntime points in the study, and median serological markers of inflammation (CRP and SAA) were \n\nnormal (< 10 mg/litre) at all post-baseline time points. Although approximately 22% of patients \n\nreceiving canakinumab required dose adjustment, only a small percentage of patients (1.2%) \n\ndiscontinued canakinumab due to lack of therapeutic effect. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe CAPS interventional trials with canakinumab included a total of 80 paediatric patients with an age \n\nrange from 2 to 17 years (approximately half of them treated on an mg/kg basis). Overall, there were \n\nno clinically meaningful differences in the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of canakinumab in \n\npaediatric patients compared to the overall CAPS population. The majority of paediatric patients \n\nachieved improvement in clinical symptoms and objective markers of inflammation (e.g. SAA and \n\nCRP). \n\n \n\nA 56-week, open-label study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of \n\ncanakinumab in paediatric CAPS patients ≤ 4 years of age. Seventeen patients (including 6 patients \n\nunder the age of 2 years) were evaluated, using weight-based starting doses of 2-8 mg/kg. The study \n\nalso evaluated the effect of canakinumab on the development of antibodies to standard childhood \n\nvaccines. No differences in safety or efficacy were observed in patients under the age of 2 years \n\ncompared with patients aged 2 years and above. All patients who received non-live, standard of care \n\nchildhood vaccinations (N=7) developed protective antibody levels. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nThe efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF were \n\ndemonstrated in a single, pivotal, phase III, 4-part study (N2301) consisting of three separate disease \n\ncohorts. \n\n- Part I: Patients in each disease cohort aged 2 years and older entered a 12-week screening period \nduring which they were evaluated for the onset of disease flare. \n\n- Part II: Patients at flare onset were randomised into a 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntreatment period during which they received either 150 mg canakinumab (2 mg/kg for patients \n\nwith body weight ≤ 40 kg) subcutaneous (s.c.) or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients > 28 days but \n\n< 2 years of age were allowed to enter the study directly into an open-arm of Part II as non-\n\nrandomised patients (and were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis). \n\n- Part III: Patients who completed 16 weeks of treatment and were classified as responders were \nre-randomised into a 24-week, double-blind withdrawal period during which they received \n\ncanakinumab 150 mg (2 mg/kg for patients ≤ 40 kg) s.c. or placebo every 8 weeks. \n\n- Part IV: All Part III patients treated with canakinumab were eligible to enter into a 72-week \nopen-label treatment extension period. \n\n \n\nA total of 185 patients aged 28 days and above were enrolled and a total of 181 patients aged 2 years \n\nand above were randomised in part II of the study. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the randomised treatment period (Part II) was the proportion of \n\nresponders within each cohort who had resolution of their index disease flare at day 15 and did not \n\nexperience a new flare during the remainder of the 16-week treatment period (defined as complete \n\nresponse). Resolution of the index disease flare was defined as having a Physician’s Global \n\nAssessment (PGA) of Disease Activity score < 2 (“minimal or no disease”) and CRP within normal \n\nrange (≤ 10 mg/l) or reduction ≥ 70% from baseline. A new flare was defined as a PGA score ≥ 2 \n\n(“mild, moderate, or severe disease”) and CRP ≥ 30 mg/l. Secondary endpoints, all based on week 16 \n\nresults (end of Part II), included the proportion of patients who achieved a PGA score of < 2, the \n\nproportion of patients with serological remission (defined as CRP ≤ 10 mg/l), and the proportion of \n\npatients with a normalised SAA level (defined as SAA ≤ 10 mg/l). \n\n \n\nFor the primary efficacy endpoint, canakinumab was superior to placebo for all three disease cohorts. \n\nCanakinumab also demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo on the secondary endpoints of \nPGA < 2 and CRP ≤ 10 mg/l in all three cohorts. Higher proportions of patients had normalised SAA \n\n(≤ 10 mg/l) at week 16 with canakinumab treatment compared to placebo in all three cohorts, with a \n\nstatistically significant difference observed in TRAPS patients (see Table 3 with study results below). \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTable 3 Tabulated summary of efficacy in Phase III trial, pivotal, randomised, placebo-\n\ncontrolled treatment period (Part II) \n\n \n\nPhase III trial, pivotal, randomised placebo-controlled treatment period (Part II) \n\n Canakinumab \n\nn/N (%) \n\nPlacebo \n\nn/N (%) \n\n \n\np-value \n\nPrimary endpoint (disease flare) - Proportion of patients who had index disease flare resolution at \n\nday 15 and did not experience a new flare during the remainder of the 16-week treatment period \n\nFMF 19/31 (61.29) 2/32 (6.25) < 0.0001* \n\nHIDS/MKD 13/37 (35.14) 2/35 (5.71) 0.0020* \n\nTRAPS 10/22 (45.45) 2/24 (8.33) 0.0050* \n\nSecondary endpoints (disease and inflammatory markers) \n Physician Global Assessment < 2    \n\nFMF 20/31 (64.52) 3/32 (9.38) < 0.0001** \n\nHIDS/MKD 17/37 (45.95) 2/35 (5.71) 0.0006** \n\nTRAPS 10/22 (45.45) 1/24 (4.17) 0.0028** \n\n C-reactive protein ≤ 10 mg/l    \n\nFMF 21/31 (67.74) 2/32 (6.25) < 0.0001** \n\nHIDS/MKD 15/37 (40.54) 2/35 (5.71) 0.0010** \n\nTRAPS 8/22 (36.36) 2/24 (8.33) 0.0149** \n\n Serum amyloid A ≤ 10 mg/l    \n\nFMF 8/31 (25.81) 0/32 (0.00) 0.0286 \n\nHIDS/MKD 5/37 (13.51) 1/35 (2.86) 0.0778 \n\nTRAPS 6/22 (27.27) 0/24 (0.00) 0.0235** \n\nn=number of responders; N=number of evaluable patients \n\n* indicates statistical significance (one-sided) at the 0.025 level based on Fisher exact test \n\n** Indicates statistical significance (one-sided) at the 0.025 level based on the logistic regression model \n\nwith treatment group and baseline PGA, CRP or SAA respectively, as explanatory variables for each \n\ncohort \n\n \n\nUp-titration \n\nIn Part II of the study, patients treated with canakinumab who had persistent disease activity received \n\nan additional dose of 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg for patients ≤ 40 kg) within the first month. This additional \n\ndose could be provided as early as 7 days after the first treatment dose. All up-titrated patients \n\nremained at the increased dose of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients ≤ 40 kg) every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory analysis of the primary endpoint, it was observed that in patients with an inadequate \n\nresponse after the first dose, an up-titration within the first month to a dose of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg) \n\nevery 4 weeks further improved flare control, reduced disease activity and normalised CRP and SAA \n\nlevels. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients: \n\nTwo non-randomised HIDS/MKD patients aged > 28 days but < 2 years were included in the study \n\nand received canakinumab. One patient had resolution of index flare by day 15 after receiving one \n\nsingle dose of canakinumab 2 mg/kg, but discontinued treatment after this first dose due to serious \n\nadverse events (pancytopenia and hepatic failure). This patient presented at study entry with a history \n\nof immune thrombocytopenic purpura and an active medical condition of abnormal hepatic function. \n\nThe second patient received a starting dose of canakinumab 2 mg/kg and an add-on dose of 2 mg/kg at \n\nweek 3, and was up-titrated at week 5 to receive a dose of 4 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks until \n\nthe end of Part II of the study. Resolution of disease flare was achieved by week 5 and the patient had \n\nnot experienced any new flare at the end of Part II of the study (week 16). \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nSJIA \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of active SJIA was assessed in two pivotal phase III \n\nstudies (G2305 and G2301). Patients enrolled were aged 2 to < 20 years (mean age of 8.5 years and \n\nmean disease duration of 3.5 years at baseline) and had active disease defined as ≥ 2 joints with active \n\narthritis, fever and elevated CRP. \n\n \n\nStudy G2305 \n\nStudy G2305 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study assessing the short-\n\nterm efficacy of canakinumab in 84 patients randomised to receive a single dose of 4 mg/kg (up to \n\n300 mg) canakinumab or placebo. The primary objective was the proportion of patients at day 15 who \n\nachieved a minimum 30% improvement in the paediatric American College of Rheumatology (ACR) \n\nresponse criterion adapted to include absence of fever. Canakinumab treatment improved all paediatric \n\nACR response scores as compared to placebo at days 15 and 29 (Table 4). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Paediatric ACR response and disease status at days 15 and 29 \n\n \n\n Day 15 Day 29 \n\n Canakinumab \n\nN=43 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=41 \n\nCanakinumab\n\nN=43 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=41 \n\nACR30 84% 10% 81% 10% \n\nACR50 67% 5% 79% 5% \n\nACR70 61% 2% 67% 2% \n\nACR90 42% 0% 47% 2% \n\nACR100 33% 0% 33% 2% \n\nInactive disease 33% 0% 30% 0% \n\nTreatment difference for all ACR scores was significant (p ≤ 0.0001) \n\n \n\nResults for the components of the adapted paediatric ACR which included systemic and arthritic \n\ncomponents, were consistent with the overall ACR response results. At day 15, the median change \n\nfrom baseline in the number of joints with active arthritis and limited range of motion were -67% \n\nand -73% for canakinumab (N=43), respectively, compared to a median change of 0% and 0% for \n\nplacebo (N=41). The mean change in patient pain score (0-100 mm visual analogue scale) at day 15 \n\nwas -50.0 mm for canakinumab (N=43), as compared to +4.5 mm for placebo (N=25). The mean \n\nchange in pain score among canakinumab treated patients was consistent at day 29. \n\n \n\nStudy G2301 \n\nStudy G2301 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study of flare prevention \n\nby canakinumab. The study consisted of two parts with two independent primary endpoints (successful \n\nsteroid taper and time to flare). In Part I (open label) 177 patients were enrolled and received 4 mg/kg \n\n(up to 300 mg) canakinumab administered every 4 weeks for up to 32 weeks. Patients in Part II \n\n(double-blind) received either canakinumab 4 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks until 37 flare events \n\noccurred. \n\n \n\nCorticosteroid dose tapering: \n\nOf the total 128 patients who entered Part I taking corticosteroids, 92 attempted corticosteroid \n\ntapering. Fifty-seven (62%) of the 92 patients who attempted to taper were able to successfully taper \n\ntheir corticosteroid dose and 42 (46%) discontinued corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nTime to flare: \n\nPatients taking canakinumab in Part II had a 64% reduced risk of a flare event as compared to the \n\nplacebo group (hazard ratio of 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.75; p=0.0032). Sixty-three of the 100 patients \n\nentering Part II, whether assigned to placebo or canakinumab, did not experience a flare over the \n\nobservation period (up to a maximum of 80 weeks). \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes in studies G2305 and G2301 \n\nTreatment with canakinumab resulted in clinically relevant improvements in patients’ physical \n\nfunction and quality of life. In study G2305, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire Least \n\nSquares means improvement was 0.69 for canakinumab vs placebo representing 3.6 times the minimal \n\nclinically important difference of 0.19 (p=0.0002). The median improvement from baseline to end of \n\nPart I of study G2301 was 0.88 (79%). Statistically significant improvements in the Child Health \n\nQuestionnaire-PF50 scores were reported for canakinumab vs placebo in study G2305 (physical \n\np=0.0012; psychosocial well-being p=0.0017). \n\n \n\nPooled efficacy analysis \n\nData from the first 12 weeks of canakinumab treatment from studies G2305, G2301 and the extension \n\nstudy were pooled to assess maintenance of efficacy. These data showed similar improvements from \n\nbaseline to week 12 in the adapted paediatric ACR responses and its components to those observed in \n\nthe placebo controlled study (G2305). At week 12, the adapted paediatric ACR30, 50, 70, 90 and 100 \n\nresponses were: 70%, 69%, 61%, 49% and 30%, respectively and 28% of patients had inactive disease \n\n(N=178). \n\n \n\nAlthough limited, evidence from the clinical trials suggests that patients not responding to tocilizumab \n\nor anakinra may respond to canakinumab. \n\n \n\nStudy G2301E1 \n\nThe efficacy observed in the studies G2305 and G2301 was maintained in the open-label long-term \n\nextension study G2301E1. Of the 270 SJIA patients in the study, 147 patients had received treatment \n\nwith canakinumab in studies G2305 or G2301 (Cohort I), and 123 patients were canakinumab-naive \n\npatients (Cohort II). Patients in Cohort I were treated for a median duration of 3.2 years (up to \n\n5.2 years), and patients in Cohort II were treated for a median duration of 1.8 years (up to 2.8 years). \n\nIn the extension study, all patients received canakinumab 4 mg/kg (up to maximum 300 mg) every \n\n4 weeks. In both cohorts, patients who were well-controlled responders (retrospectively defined as \n\nadapted paediatric ACR ≥ 90) and who did not require a concomitant corticosteroid were permitted to \n\nreduce their canakinumab dose to 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks (62/270; 23%). \n\n \n\nStudy G2306 \n\nStudy G2306 was an open-label study to assess maintenance of treatment response with canakinumab \n\ndose reduction (2 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or dose interval prolongation (4 mg/kg every 8 weeks) in \n\nSJIA patients who were receiving canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Seventy five patients aged 2 \n\nto 22 years who maintained inactive disease status for at least 6 consecutive months (clinical \n\nremission) with canakinumab monotherapy, including patients who were able to maintain inactive \n\ndisease status with discontinuation of concomitant corticosteroid and/or methotrexate use for at least \n\n4 weeks, were randomised to receive canakinumab 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks (N=38) or canakinumab \n\n4 mg/kg every 8 weeks (N=37). After 24 weeks, 71% (27/38) of patients who received the reduced \n\ndose (2 mg/kg every 4 weeks) and 84% (31/37) of patients who received the prolonged dosing interval \n\n(4 mg/kg every 8 weeks) were able to maintain inactive disease status for 6 months. Of the patients in \n\nclinical remission who continued with further dose reduction (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or dose interval \n\nprolongation (4 mg/kg every 12 weeks), 93% (26/28) and 91% (30/33) of patients, respectively, were \n\nable to maintain inactive disease status for 6 months. Patients who maintained inactive disease status \n\nfor 6 additional months at this lowest dose regimen were allowed to discontinue canakinumab. \n\nOverall, 33% (25/75) of patients randomised to dose reduction or dose interval prolongation arms \n\nwere able to discontinue treatment with canakinumab and maintain inactive disease status for \n\n6 months. The rate of adverse events in both treatment arms was similar to the rate seen in patients \n\ntreated with canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAOSD \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab 4 mg/kg (up to maximum 300 mg) administered every 4 weeks in AOSD \n\npatients in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study in 36 patients (22 to 70 years old) was \n\ncomparable to that observed in SJIA patients. In study GDE01T, a higher proportion of patients \n\n(12/18, 66.7%) in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group (7/17, 41.2%) demonstrated an \n\nimprovement from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-\n\nESR) of > 1.2 at week 12, which failed to reach statistical significance (odds ratio 2.86, treatment \n\ndifference [%] 25.49 [95% CI: 9.43, 55.80]). By week 4, 7 of 18 patients (38.9%) treated with \n\ncanakinumab had already achieved DAS28-ESR remission versus 2 of 17 patients (11.8%) on placebo. \n\nThese data are consistent with the results of a pooled efficacy analysis of 418 SJIA patients which \n\nshowed that the efficacy of canakinumab in a subset of SJIA patients aged 16 to < 20 years (n=34) was \n\nconsistent with the efficacy observed in patients less than 16 years of age (n=384). \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis attacks was demonstrated in two \n\nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with frequent gouty \n\narthritis (≥ 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) unable to use NSAIDs or colchicine (due to \n\ncontraindication, intolerance or lack of efficacy). The studies were 12 weeks followed by 12-week \n\ndouble-blind extension. A total of 225 patients were treated with subcutaneous canakinumab 150 mg \n\nand 229 patients were treated with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 40 mg at study entry, \n\nand when experiencing a new attack thereafter. The mean number of gouty arthritis attacks in the \n\nprevious 12 months was 6.5. Over 85% of patients had comorbidity, including hypertension (60%), \n\ndiabetes (15%), ischaemic heart disease (12%), and stage ≥ 3 chronic kidney disease (25%). \n\nApproximately one-third of the patients enrolled (76 [33.8%] in the canakinumab group and 84 \n\n[36.7%] in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had documented inability (intolerance, contraindication \n\nor lack of response) to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. Concomitant treatment with ULTs was \n\nreported by 42% of patients at entry. \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints were: (i) gouty arthritis pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) at \n\n72 hours post-dose, and (ii) time to first new gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nFor the overall study population, pain intensity was statistically significantly lower for canakinumab \n\n150 mg compared with triamcinolone acetonide at 72 hours. Canakinumab also reduced the risk of \n\nsubsequent attacks (see Table 5). \n\n \n\nEfficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on \n\nULT, failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study \n\npopulation with a statistically significant difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide in pain \n\nintensity at 72 hours (-10.2 mm, p=0.0208) and in reduction of risk of subsequent attacks (Hazard ratio \n\n0.39, p=0.0047 at 24 weeks). \n\n \n\nEfficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) are presented in \n\nTable 5. Treatment with canakinumab induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent \n\nattacks in patients using ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine, although the observed \n\ntreatment difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was less pronounced than with the overall \n\nstudy population. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 5 Efficacy for the overall study population and in a subgroup of patients currently \n\nusing ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine \n\n \n\nEfficacy endpoint Overall study population;  \n\nN=454 \n\nUnable to use both NSAIDs \n\nand colchicine; on ULT \n\nN=62 \n\nTreatment of gouty arthritis attacks as measured by pain intensity (VAS) at 72 h \n\nLeast Squares mean estimated \n\ndifference to triamcinolone acetonide \n\nCI \n\np-value, 1-sided \n\n-10.7 \n\n \n\n(-15.4, -6.0) \n\np < 0.0001* \n\n-3.8 \n\n \n\n(-16.7, 9.1) \n\np=0.2798 \n\nRisk reduction of subsequent gouty arthritis attacks as measured by time to first new flare \n\n(24 weeks) \n\nHazard ratio to triamcinolone \n\nacetonide \n\nCI \n\np-value, 1-sided \n\n0.44 \n\n \n\n(0.32, 0.60) \n\np < 0.0001* \n\n0.71 \n\n \n\n(0.29, 1.77) \n\np=0.2337 \n\n* Denotes significant p-value ≤ 0.025 \n\n \n\nSafety results showed an increased incidence of adverse events for canakinumab compared to \n\ntriamcinolone acetonide, with 66% vs 53% of patients reporting any adverse event and 20% vs 10% of \n\npatients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nOverall, the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of canakinumab in elderly patients ≥ 65 years of \n\nage was comparable to patients < 65 years of age. \n\n \n\nPatients on urate lowering therapy (ULT) \n\nIn clinical studies, canakinumab has been safely administered with ULT. In the overall study \n\npopulation, patients on ULT had a less pronounced treatment difference in both pain reduction and \n\nreduction in the risk of subsequent gouty arthritis attacks compared to patients not on ULT. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAntibodies against canakinumab were observed in approximately 1.5%, 3% and 2% of the patients \n\ntreated with canakinumab for CAPS, SJIA and gouty arthritis, respectively. No neutralising antibodies \n\nwere detected. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events \n\nwas observed. \n\n \n\nThere were no antibodies against canakinumab observed in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients \n\ntreated with doses of 150 mg and 300 mg over 16 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe Marketing Authorisation Holder has completed four Paediatric Investigation Plans for \n\ncanakinumab (for CAPS, SJIA, FMF – HIDS/MKD and TRAPS respectively). This product \n\ninformation has been updated to include the results of studies with canakinumab in the paediatric \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ncanakinumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in gouty arthritis (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nCAPS \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe peak serum canakinumab concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately 7 days following single \n\nsubcutaneous administration of 150 mg in adult CAPS patients. The mean terminal half-life was \n\n26 days. Mean values for Cmax and AUCinf after a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg in a typical \n\nadult CAPS patient (70 kg) were 15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml. The absolute bioavailability of \n\nsubcutaneously administered canakinumab was estimated to be 66%. Exposure parameters (such as \n\nAUC and Cmax) increased in proportion to dose over the dose range of 0.30 to 10.0 mg/kg given as \n\nintravenous infusion or from 150 to 600 mg as subcutaneous injection. Predicted steady-state exposure \n\nvalues (Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, AUC,ss,8w) after 150 mg subcutaneous administration (or 2 mg/kg, respectively) \n\nevery 8 weeks were slightly higher in the weight category 40-70 kg (6.6 µg/ml, 24.3 µg/ml, \n\n767 µg*d/ml) compared to the weight categories < 40 kg (4.0 µg/ml, 19.9 µg/ml, 566 µg*d/ml) and \n\n> 70 kg (4.6 µg/ml, 17.8 µg/ml, 545 µg*d/ml). The expected accumulation ratio was 1.3-fold \n\nfollowing 6 months of subcutaneous administration of 150 mg canakinumab every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nCanakinumab binds to serum IL-1 beta. The distribution volume (Vss) of canakinumab varied \n\naccording to body weight. It was estimated to be 6.2 litres in a CAPS patient of body weight 70 kg. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of canakinumab increases with body weight. It was estimated to be \n\n0.17 l/d in a CAPS patient of body weight 70 kg and 0.11 l/d in a SJIA patient of body weight 33 kg. \n\nAfter accounting for body weight differences, no clinically significant differences in the \n\npharmacokinetic properties of canakinumab were observed between CAPS and SJIA patients. \n\n \n\nThere was no indication of accelerated clearance or time-dependent change in the pharmacokinetic \n\nproperties of canakinumab following repeated administration. No gender or age-related \n\npharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for body weight. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\n \n\nBioavailability in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients has not been determined independently. \n\nApparent clearance (CL/F) in the TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF population at body weight of 55 kg \n\n(0.14 l/d) was comparable to CAPS population at body weight of 70 kg (0.17 l/d). The apparent \n\nvolume of distribution (V/F) was 4.96 l at body weight of 55 kg. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 150 mg every 4 weeks, canakinumab minimal \n\nconcentration at week 16 (Cmin) was estimated to be 15.4 ± 6.6 g/ml. The estimated steady state \n\nAUCtau was 636.7 ± 260.2 μg*d/ml. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nBioavailability in SJIA patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance per kg \n\nbody weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the SJIA and CAPS population (0.004 l/d per \n\nkg). The apparent volume of distribution per kg (V/F per kg) was 0.14 l/kg. Sparse pharmacokinetics \n\n(PK) data in AOSD patients suggest similar PK of canakinumab as compared to SJIA and other patient \n\npopulations. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated administration of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks the accumulation ratio of canakinumab was \n\n1.6 fold in SJIA patients. Steady state was reached after 110 days. The overall predicted mean (±SD) \n\nfor Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC,ss4w were 14.7±8.8 μg/ml, 36.5 ± 14.9 μg/ml and 696.1 ± 326.5 μg*d/ml, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nThe AUCss4w in each age group was 692, 615, 707 and 742 µg*d/ml for 2-3, 4-5, 6-11, and 12-19 years \n\nold, respectively. When stratified by weight, a lower (30-40%) median of exposure for Cmin,ss (11.4 vs \n\n19 µg/ml) and AUCss (594 vs 880 µg*d/ml) for the lower bodyweight category (≤ 40 kg) vs the higher \n\nbodyweight category (> 40 kg) was observed. \n\n \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in \n\nyoung adult SJIA patients aged 16 to 20 years were similar to those in patients less than 16 years of \n\nage. Predicted canakinumab steady state exposures at a dose level of 4 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) in \n\npatients over the age of 20 years were comparable to those in SJIA patients younger than 20 years of \n\nage. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis population \n\n \n\nBioavailability in gouty arthritis patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance \n\nper kg body weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the gouty arthritis and CAPS population \n\n(0.004 l/d/kg). Mean exposure in a typical gouty arthritis patient (93 kg) after a single subcutaneous \n\n150 mg dose (Cmax: 10.8 µg/ml and AUCinf: 495 µg*d/ml) was lower than in a typical 70 kg CAPS \n\npatient (15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml). This is consistent with the observed increase in CL/F with body \n\nweight. \n\n \n\nThe expected accumulation ratio was 1.1-fold following subcutaneous administration of 150 mg \n\ncanakinumab every 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nPeak concentrations of canakinumab occurred between 2 to 7 days (Tmax) following single \n\nsubcutaneous administration of canakinumab 150 mg or 2 mg/kg in paediatric patients 4 years of age \n\nand older. The terminal half-life ranged from 22.9 to 25.7 days, similar to the pharmacokinetic \n\nproperties observed in adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the \n\npharmacokinetics of canakinumab in children aged 2 to < 4 years were similar to those in patients \n\n4 years of age and older. Subcutaneous absorption rate was estimated to decrease with age and \n\nappeared to be fastest in the youngest patients. Accordingly, Tmax was shorter (3.6 days) in younger \n\nSJIA patients (2-3 years) compared to older SJIA patients (12-19 years; Tmax 6 days). Bioavailability \n\n(AUCss) was not affected. \n\n \n\nAn additional pharmacokinetics analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in \n\n6 paediatric CAPS patients under the age of 2 years were similar to the pharmacokinetics in paediatric \n\npatients 2-4 years of age. Based on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the expected \n\nexposures after a dose of 2 mg/kg were comparable across the CAPS paediatric age groups, but were \n\napproximately 40% lower in paediatric patients of very low body weight (e.g. 10 kg) than in adult \n\npatients (150 mg dose). This is consistent with the observations of higher exposure in higher body \n\nweight groups in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nIn TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF, exposure parameters (trough concentrations) were comparable \n\nacross age groups from 2 to < 20 years old following subcutaneous administration of canakinumab \n\n2 mg/kg every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic properties are similar in CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA paediatric \n\npopulations. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\n \n\nNo change in pharmacokinetic parameters based on clearance or volume of distribution were observed \n\nbetween elderly patients and adult patients < 65 years of age. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of cross-\n\nreactivity, repeated dose toxicity, immunotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with canakinumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\n \n\nIlaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks \n\n(at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n(NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate \n\nresponse, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nFor CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and Still’s disease, the treatment should be initiated and \n\nsupervised by a specialist physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the relevant \n\nindication. \n\n \n\nFor gouty arthritis, the physician should be experienced in the use of biologics and Ilaris should be \n\nadministered by a healthcare professional. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nCAPS: Adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older \n\nThe recommended starting dose of canakinumab for CAPS patients is: \n\nAdults, adolescents and children ≥ 4 years of age: \n\n 150 mg for patients with body weight > 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients with body weight ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg and < 15 kg \nChildren 2 to < 4 years of age: \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg \n \n\nThis is administered every eight weeks as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nFor patients with a starting dose of 150 mg or 2 mg/kg, if a satisfactory clinical response (resolution of \n\nrash and other generalised inflammatory symptoms) has not been achieved 7 days after treatment start, \n\na second dose of canakinumab at 150 mg or 2 mg/kg can be considered. If a full treatment response is \n\nsubsequently achieved, the intensified dosing regimen of 300 mg or 4 mg/kg every 8 weeks should be \n\nmaintained. If a satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved 7 days after this increased dose, a \n\nthird dose of canakinumab at 300 mg or 4 mg/kg can be considered. If a full treatment response is \n\nsubsequently achieved, maintaining the intensified dosing regimen of 600 mg or 8 mg/kg every \n\n8 weeks should be considered, based on individual clinical judgement. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n29 \n\nFor patients with a starting dose of 4 mg/kg, if a satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved \n\n7 days after treatment start, a second dose of canakinumab 4 mg/kg can be considered. If a full \n\ntreatment response is subsequently achieved, maintaining the intensified dosing regimen of 8 mg/kg \n\nevery 8 weeks should be considered, based on individual clinical judgement. \n\n \n\nClinical experience with dosing at intervals of less than 4 weeks or at doses above 600 mg or 8 mg/kg \n\nis limited. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nCAPS in adults and children  4 years of age \n 15 kg \n\nMaintenance dose: \n150 mg or 2 mg/kg \n\nevery 8 weeks \n\nAdditional dose of \n150 mg or 2 mg/kg \ncan be considered \n\n150 mg or 2 mg/kg \n\nAdditional dose of \n300 mg or 4 mg/kg can \n\nbe considered \n\nMaintenance \ndose 4 mg/kg \nevery 8 weeks \n\nAdditional dose \nof 4 mg/kg can \nbe considered \n\nSatisfactory clinical response after \n7 days? \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\nMaintenance dose: \n300 mg or 4 mg/kg \n\nevery 8 weeks \n\nIf full treatment response after \n7 days, maintenance dose: \n600 mg or 8 mg/kg every \n\n8 weeks \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\n4 mg/kg \n\nCAPS in children 2-< 4 years of age or  \n\nchildren  4 years of age  7.5 kg and < 15 kg \n\nIf full treatment \nresponse after 7 days, \n\nmaintenance dose: \n8 mg/kg every 8 weeks \n\nYes No \n\nNo \nNo Yes Yes \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF: Adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older \n\nThe recommended starting dose of canakinumab in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients is: \n\n 150 mg for patients with body weight > 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg and ≤ 40 kg \n \n\nThis is administered every four weeks as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nIf a satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved 7 days after treatment start, a second dose of \n\ncanakinumab at 150 mg or 2 mg/kg can be considered. If a full treatment response is subsequently \n\nachieved, the intensified dosing regimen of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) every \n\n4 weeks should be maintained. \n\n \n\nContinued treatment with canakinumab in patients without clinical improvement should be \n\nreconsidered by the treating physician. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nThe recommended dose of canakinumab for patients with Still’s disease with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg is \n\n4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 300 mg) administered every four weeks via subcutaneous injection. \n\nContinued treatment with canakinumab in patients without clinical improvement should be \n\nreconsidered by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nManagement of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or \n\noptimised. Canakinumab should be used as an on-demand therapy to treat gouty arthritis attacks. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of canakinumab for adult patients with gouty arthritis is 150 mg administered \n\nsubcutaneously as a single dose during an attack. For maximum effect, canakinumab should be \n\nadministered as soon as possible after the onset of a gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients  \nwith body weight > 40 kg \n\nMaintenance \ndose: 150 mg \nevery 4 weeks \n\nAdditional dose of \n150 mg can be \n\nconsidered \n\n150 mg \n\nMaintenance \ndose 2 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks \n\nAdditional dose \nof 2 mg/kg can \nbe considered \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\nSatisfactory clinical \nresponse after 7 days? \n\n2 mg/kg \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients  \n\nwith body weight  7.5 kg and ≤ 40 kg \n\nIf full treatment response is \nachieved, maintenance dose: \n\n4 mg/kg every 4 weeks \n\nNo \n \n\nNo Yes Yes \n \n\nIf full treatment response is \nachieved, maintenance dose: \n\n300 mg every 4 weeks \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPatients who do not respond to initial treatment should not be re-treated with canakinumab. In patients \n\nwho respond and require re-treatment, there should be an interval of at least 12 weeks before a new \n\ndose of canakinumab may be administered (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nThe safety and efficacy of canakinumab in CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients under \n\n2 years of age have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nSJIA \n\nThe safety and efficacy of canakinumab in SJIA patients under 2 years of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nThere is no relevant use of canakinumab in the paediatric population in the indication gouty arthritis. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nCanakinumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, clinical experience in such \n\npatients is limited. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor subcutaneous use. \n\nThe following are suitable injection sites: upper thigh, abdomen, upper arm or buttocks. It is \n\nrecommended to select a different injection site each time the product is injected to avoid soreness. \n\nBroken skin and areas which are bruised or covered by a rash should be avoided. Injection into scar \n\ntissue should be avoided as this may result in insufficient exposure to canakinumab. \n\n \n\nEach vial is for single use in a single patient, for a single dose. \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in the correct injection technique, patients or their caregivers may inject \n\ncanakinumab if the physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary \n\n(see section 6.6). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nCanakinumab is associated with an increased incidence of serious infections. Therefore patients \n\nshould be monitored carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment with \n\ncanakinumab. Physicians should exercise caution when administering canakinumab to patients with \n\ninfections, a history of recurring infections, or underlying conditions which may predispose them to \n\ninfections. \n\n \n\nTreatment of CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nCanakinumab should not be initiated or continued in patients during an active infection requiring \n\nmedical intervention. \n\n \n\nTreatment of gouty arthritis \n\nCanakinumab should not be administered during an active infection. \n\nConcomitant use of canakinumab with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended \n\nbecause this may increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections (including aspergillosis, atypical mycobacterial \n\ninfections, herpes zoster) have been reported during canakinumab treatment. The causal relationship of \n\ncanakinumab to these events cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis screening \n\n \n\nIn approximately 12% of CAPS patients tested with a PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test in \n\nclinical trials, follow-up testing yielded a positive test result while treated with canakinumab without \n\nclinical evidence of a latent or active tuberculosis infection. \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether the use of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors such as canakinumab increases the risk \n\nof reactivation of tuberculosis. Before initiation of therapy, all patients must be evaluated for both \n\nactive and latent tuberculosis infection. Particularly in adult patients, this evaluation should include a \n\ndetailed medical history. Appropriate screening tests (e.g. tuberculin skin test, interferon gamma \n\nrelease assay or chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). \n\nPatients must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis during and after treatment \n\nwith canakinumab. All patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms \n\nsuggestive of tuberculosis (e.g. persistent cough, weight loss, subfebrile temperature) appear during \n\ncanakinumab therapy. In the event of conversion from a negative to a positive PPD test, especially in \n\nhigh-risk patients, alternative means of screening for a tuberculosis infection should be considered. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and leukopenia \n\n \n\nNeutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1.5 x 109/l) and leukopenia have been observed with \n\nmedicinal products that inhibit IL-1, including canakinumab. Treatment with canakinumab should not \n\nbe initiated in patients with neutropenia or leukopenia. It is recommended that white blood cell (WBC) \n\ncounts including neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to \n\n2 months. For chronic or repeated therapies, it is also recommended to assess WBC counts \n\nperiodically during treatment. If a patient becomes neutropenic or leukopenic, the WBC counts should \n\nbe monitored closely and treatment discontinuation should be considered. \n\n \n\nMalignancies \n\n \n\nMalignancy events have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab. The risk for the \n\ndevelopment of malignancies with anti-interleukin (IL)-1 therapy is unknown. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions with canakinumab therapy have been reported. The majority of these events \n\nwere mild in severity. During clinical development of canakinumab in over 2,600 patients, no \n\nanaphylactoid or anaphylactic reactions attributable to treatment with canakinumab were reported. \n\nHowever, the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, which is not uncommon for injectable proteins, \n\ncannot be excluded (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic function \n\n \n\nTransient and asymptomatic cases of elevations of serum transaminases or bilirubin have been \n\nreported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nNo data are available on the risk of secondary transmission of infection by live (attenuated) vaccines \n\nin patients receiving canakinumab. Therefore, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with \n\ncanakinumab unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of canakinumab therapy it is recommended that adult and paediatric patients receive \n\nall vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMutation in NLRP3 gene in CAPS patients \n\n \n\nClinical experience in CAPS patients without a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene is limited. \n\n \n\nMacrophage activation syndrome in patients with Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in \n\npatients with rheumatic conditions, in particular Still’s disease. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, \n\nevaluation and treatment should be started as early as possible. Physicians should be attentive to \n\nsymptoms of infection or worsening of Still’s disease, as these are known triggers for MAS. Based on \n\nclinical trial experience, canakinumab does not appear to increase the incidence of MAS in Still’s \n\ndisease patients, but no definitive conclusion can be made. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInteractions between canakinumab and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nAn increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 \n\nblocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Use of canakinumab with TNF inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections. \n\n \n\nThe expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by the cytokines that stimulate \n\nchronic inflammation, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Thus, CYP450 expression may be \n\nreversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as canakinumab, is introduced. This is \n\nclinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index where the dose is \n\nindividually adjusted. On initiation of canakinumab in patients being treated with this type of \n\nmedicinal product, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or of the active substance concentration should \n\nbe performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as necessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nNo data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of \n\ninfection by live vaccines in patients receiving canakinumab. Therefore, live vaccines should not be \n\ngiven concurrently with canakinumab unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Should \n\nvaccination with live vaccines be indicated after initiation of canakinumab treatment, the \n\nrecommendation is to wait for at least 3 months after the last canakinumab injection and before the \n\nnext one (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe results of a study in healthy adult subjects demonstrated that a single dose of canakinumab \n\n300 mg did not affect the induction and persistence of antibody responses after vaccination with \n\ninfluenza or glycosylated protein based meningococcus vaccines. \n\n \n\nThe results of a 56-week, open label study in CAPS patients aged 4 years and younger demonstrated \n\nthat all patients who received non-live, standard of care childhood vaccinations developed protective \n\nantibody levels. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen should use effective contraceptives during treatment with canakinumab and for up to \n\n3 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of canakinumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do \n\nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nThe risk for the foetus/mother is unknown. Women who are pregnant or who desire to become \n\npregnant should therefore only be treated after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate that canakinumab crosses the placenta and is detectable in the foetus. No \n\nhuman data are available, but as canakinumab is an immunoglobulin of the G class (IgG1), human \n\ntransplacental transfer is expected. The clinical impact of this is unknown. However, administration of \n\nlive vaccines to newborn infants exposed to canakinumab in utero is not recommended for 16 weeks \n\nfollowing the mother’s last dose of canakinumab before childbirth. Women who received \n\ncanakinumab during pregnancy should be instructed to inform the baby’s healthcare professional \n\nbefore any vaccinations are given to their newborn infant. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether canakinumab is excreted in human milk. The decision whether to breast-feed \n\nduring canakinumab therapy should therefore only be taken after a thorough benefit-risk evaluation. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have shown that a murine anti-murine IL-1 beta antibody had no undesirable effects on \n\ndevelopment in nursing mouse pups and that the antibody was transferred to them (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nFormal studies of the potential effect of canakinumab on human fertility have not been conducted. \n\nCanakinumab had no effect on male fertility parameters in marmosets (C. jacchus). A murine anti-\n\nmurine IL-1 beta antibody had no undesirable effects on fertility in male or female mice (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nIlaris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Treatment with Ilaris may result in \n\ndizziness/vertigo or asthenia (see section 4.8). Patients who experience such symptoms during Ilaris \n\ntreatment should wait for this to resolve completely before driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions were infections predominantly of the upper respiratory tract. \n\nNo impact on the type or frequency of adverse drug reactions was seen with longer-term treatment. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 4.4). \n\n \n\nOpportunistic infections have been reported in patients treated with canakinumab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ \n\nclass, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency category with the most common first. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n\n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 1 Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nIndications: \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF, SJIA, gouty arthritis \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common Respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza, viral \n\ninfection, sinusitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection) \n\nEar infection \n\nCellulitis \n\nGastroenteritis \n\nUrinary tract infection \n\nCommon Vulvovaginal candidiasis \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Dizziness/vertigo \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Upper abdominal pain 1 \n\nUncommon Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common Injection site reaction \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Arthralgia 1 \n\nCommon Musculoskeletal pain 1 \n\nBack pain 2 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue/asthenia 2 \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common Creatinine renal clearance decreased 1,3 \n\nProteinuria 1,4 \n\nLeukopenia 1,5 \n\nCommon Neutropenia 5 \n\nUncommon Platelet count decreased 5 \n1 In SJIA \n2 In gouty arthritis \n3 Based on estimated creatinine clearance, most were transient \n4 Most represented transient trace to 1+ positive urinary protein by dipstick \n5 See further information below \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\nStill’s Disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nSJIA pooled analysis and AOSD \n\nA total of 445 SJIA patients aged 2 to < 20 years received canakinumab in clinical trials, including \n\n321 patients aged 2 to < 12 years, 88 patients aged 12 to < 16 years, and 36 patients aged 16 to \n\n< 20 years. A pooled safety analysis of all SJIA patients showed that in the subset of young adult SJIA \n\npatients aged 16 to < 20 years, the safety profile of canakinumab was consistent with what was \n\nobserved in SJIA patients less than 16 years of age. The safety profile of canakinumab in AOSD \n\npatients in a randomised, double blind placebo-controlled study (GDE01T) in 36 adult patients (aged \n\n22 to 70 years) was similar to what was observed in SJIA patients. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nLong-term data and laboratory abnormalities in CAPS patients \n\nDuring clinical trials with canakinumab in CAPS patients mean values for haemoglobin increased and \n\nthose for white blood cell, neutrophils and platelets decreased. \n\n \n\nElevations of transaminases have been observed rarely in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nAsymptomatic and mild elevations of serum bilirubin have been observed in CAPS patients treated \n\nwith canakinumab without concomitant elevations of transaminases. \n\n \n\nIn the long-term, open-label studies with dose escalation, events of infections (gastroenteritis, \n\nrespiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection), vomiting and dizziness were more \n\nfrequently reported in the 600 mg or 8 mg/kg dose group than in other dose groups. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients \n\nNeutrophils \n\nAlthough ≥ Grade 2 reductions in neutrophil count occurred in 6.5% of patients (common) and \n\nGrade 1 reductions occurred in 9.5% of patients, the reductions are generally transient and \n\nneutropenia-associated infection has not been identified as an adverse reaction. \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nAlthough reductions in platelet count (≥ Grade 2) occurred in 0.6% of patients, bleeding has not been \n\nidentified as an adverse reaction. Mild and transient Grade 1 reduction in platelets occurred in 15.9% \n\nof patients without any associated bleeding adverse events. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in SJIA patients \n\nHaematology \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts ≤ 0.8 x LLN were \n\nreported in 33 patients (16.5%). \n\n \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreases in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to less than 1 x \n\n109/l were reported in 12 patients (6.0%). \n\n \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, transient decreases in platelet counts (< LLN) were observed in \n\n19 patients (9.5%). \n\n \n\nALT/AST \n\nIn the overall SJIA programme, high ALT and/or AST > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were \n\nreported in 19 patients (9.5%). \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\nLaboratory abnormalities in gouty arthritis patients \n\nHaematology \n\nDecreased white blood cell counts (WBC) ≤ 0.8 x lower limit of normal (LLN) were reported in 6.7% \n\nof patients treated with canakinumab compared to 1.4% treated with triamcinolone acetonide. \n\nDecreases in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) to less than 1 x 109/l were reported in 2% of patients in \n\nthe comparative trials. Isolated cases of ANC counts < 0.5 x 109/l were also observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMild (< LLN and > 75 x 109/l) and transient decreases in platelet counts were observed at a higher \n\nincidence (12.7%) with canakinumab in the active-controlled clinical studies versus the comparator \n\n(7.7%) in gouty arthritis patients. \n\n \n\nUric acid \n\nIncreases in uric acid level (0.7 mg/dl at 12 weeks and 0.5 mg/dl at 24 weeks) were observed after \n\ncanakinumab treatment in comparative trials in gouty arthritis. In another study, among patients who \n\nwere starting on ULT, increases in uric acid were not observed. Uric acid increases were not observed \n\nin clinical trials in non-gouty arthritis populations (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nALT/AST \n\nMean and median increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3.0 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, and in \n\naspartate transaminase (AST) of 2.7 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, from baseline to end of study were \n\nseen in the canakinumab-treated groups versus the triamcinolone acetonide-treated group(s), however \n\nthe incidence of clinically significant changes (≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal) was greater for patients \n\ntreated with triamcinolone acetonide (2.5% for both AST and ALT) compared with canakinumab-\n\ntreated patients (1.6% for ALT and 0.8% for AST). \n\n \n\nTriglycerides \n\nIn active-controlled gouty arthritis trials, there was a mean increase in triglycerides of 33.5 mg/dl in \n\ncanakinumab-treated patients compared with a modest decrease of -3.1 mg/dl with triamcinolone \n\nacetonide. The incidence of patients with triglyceride elevations > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) \n\nwas 2.4% with canakinumab and 0.7% with triamcinolone acetonide. The clinical significance of this \n\nobservation is unknown. \n\n \n\nLong term data from observational study \n\n \n\nA total of 243 CAPS patients (85 paediatric patients aged ≥ 2 to ≤ 17 years and 158 adult patients aged \n\n≥ 18 years) were treated with canakinumab in routine clinical practice in a long-term registry study \n\n(mean of 3.8 years of canakinumab exposure). The safety profile of canakinumab observed following \n\nlong-term treatment in this setting was consistent with what has been observed in interventional \n\nstudies in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThere were 80 paediatric CAPS patients (2-17 years of age) who received canakinumab in the \n\ninterventional studies. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety and \n\ntolerability profile of canakinumab in paediatric patients compared to the overall CAPS population \n\n(comprised of adult and paediatric patients, N=211), including the overall frequency and severity of \n\ninfectious episodes. Infections of the upper respiratory tract were the most frequently reported \n\ninfection events. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, 6 paediatric patients under the age of 2 years were evaluated in a small open-label \n\nclinical study. The safety profile of canakinumab appeared similar to that in patients aged 2 years and \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nThere were 102 TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients (2-17 years of age) who received \n\ncanakinumab in a 16-week study. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety \n\nand tolerability profile of canakinumab in paediatric patients compared to the overall population. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nElderly population \n\n \n\nThere is no significant difference in safety profile observed in patients ≥ 65 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nReported experience with overdose is limited. In early clinical trials, patients and healthy volunteers \n\nreceived doses as high as 10 mg/kg, administered intravenously or subcutaneously, without evidence \n\nof acute toxicity. \n\n \n\nIn case of overdose, it is recommended for the patient to be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \n\nadverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCanakinumab is a human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) antibody of the \n\nIgG1/κ isotype. Canakinumab binds with high affinity specifically to human IL-1 beta and neutralises \n\nthe biological activity of human IL-1 beta by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, thereby \n\npreventing IL-1 beta-induced gene activation and the production of inflammatory mediators. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nCAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nIn clinical studies, CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients who have uncontrolled over-\n\nproduction of IL-1 beta show a rapid and sustained response to therapy with canakinumab, i.e. \n\nlaboratory parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), high \n\nneutrophil and platelet counts, and leukocytosis rapidly returned to normal. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nAdult-onset Still’s disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis are severe autoinflammatory \n\ndiseases, driven by innate immunity by means of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a key one being IL-1-\n\nbeta. \n\n \n\nCommon features of SJIA and AOSD include fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, \n\npolyserositis and arthritis. Treatment with canakinumab resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement \n\nof both the articular and the systemic features of SJIA with significant reduction of the number of \n\ninflamed joints, prompt resolution of fever and reduction of acute phase reactants in the majority of \n\npatients (see Clinical efficacy and safety). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n40 \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nA gouty arthritis attack is caused by urate (monosodium urate monohydrate) crystals in the joint and \n\nsurrounding tissue, which trigger resident macrophages to produce IL-1 beta via the “NALP3 \n\ninflammasome” complex. Activation of macrophages and concomitant over-production of IL-1 beta \n\nresults in an acute painful inflammatory response. Other activators of the innate immune system, such \n\nas endogenous agonists of toll-like receptors, may contribute to the transcriptional activation of the IL-\n\n1 beta gene, initiating a gouty arthritis attack. Following canakinumab treatment, the inflammatory \n\nmarkers CRP or SAA and signs of acute inflammation (e.g. pain, swelling, redness) in the affected \n\njoint subside rapidly. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nCAPS \n\nThe efficacy and safety of canakinumab have been demonstrated in a total of 211 adult and paediatric \n\npatients with varying degrees of disease severity and different CAPS phenotypes (including \n\nFCAS/FCU, MWS, and NOMID/CINCA). Only patients with confirmed NLRP3 mutation were \n\nincluded in the pivotal study. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase I/II study, treatment with canakinumab had a rapid onset of action, with disappearance or \n\nclinically significant improvement of symptoms within one day after dosing. Laboratory parameters \n\nsuch as high CRP and SAA, high neutrophils and platelet counts normalised rapidly within days of \n\ncanakinumab injection. \n\n \n\nThe pivotal study consisted of a 48-week three-part multicentre study, i.e. an 8-week open-label period \n\n(Part I), a 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II), followed \n\nby a 16-week open-label period (Part III). The aim of the study was to assess efficacy, safety, and \n\ntolerability of canakinumab (150 mg or 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) in patients with CAPS. \n\n \n\n Part I: A complete clinical and biomarker response to canakinumab (defined as composite of \nphysician’s global assessment on autoinflammatory and on skin disease ≤ minimal and CRP or \n\nSAA values < 10 mg/litre) was observed in 97% of patients and appeared within 7 days of \n\ninitiation of treatment. Significant improvements were seen in physician’s clinical assessment of \n\nautoinflammatory disease activity: global assessment of autoinflammatory disease activity, \n\nassessment of skin disease (urticarial skin rash), arthralgia, myalgia, headache/migraine, \n\nconjunctivitis, fatigue/malaise, assessment of other related symptoms, and patient’s assessment \n\nof symptoms. \n\n \n\n Part II: In the withdrawal period of the pivotal study, the primary endpoint was defined as the \nproportion of patients with a disease relapse/flare: none (0%) of the patients randomised to \n\ncanakinumab flared, compared with 81% of the patients randomised to placebo. \n\n \n\n Part III: Patients treated with placebo in Part II who flared regained and maintained clinical and \nserological response following entry into the open-label canakinumab extension. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nTable 2 Tabulated summary of efficacy in Phase III trial, pivotal placebo-controlled \n\nwithdrawal period (Part II) \n\n \n\nPhase III trial, pivotal placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II) \n\n Canakinumab \n\nN=15 \n\nn(%) \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=16 \n\nn(%) \n\n \n\np-value \n\n \n\nPrimary endpoint (flare) \n Proportion of patients with disease flare in Part II 0 (0%) 13 (81%) < 0.001 \n\n \n\nInflammatory markers* \n C-reactive protein, mg/l 1.10 (0.40) 19.93 (10.50) < 0.001 \n\n Serum amyloid A, mg/l 2.27 (-0.20) 71.09 (14.35) 0.002 \n\n* mean (median) change from beginning of Part II \n\n \n\nTwo open-label, uncontrolled, long-term phase III studies were performed. One was a safety, \n\ntolerability, and efficacy study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. The total treatment duration \n\nranged from 6 months to 2 years. The other was an open-label study with canakinumab to evaluate the \n\nefficacy and safety in Japanese CAPS patients for 24 weeks, with an extension phase up to 48 weeks. \n\nThe primary objective was to assess the proportion of patients who were free of relapse at week 24, \n\nincluding those patients whose dose was increased. \n\n \n\nIn the pooled efficacy analysis for these two studies, 65.6% of patients who had not previously been \n\ntreated with canakinumab achieved complete response at 150 mg or 2 mg/kg, while 85.2% of patients \n\nachieved complete response at any dose. Of the patients treated with 600 mg or 8 mg/kg (or even \n\nhigher), 43.8% achieved complete response. Fewer patients aged 2 to < 4 years achieved complete \n\nresponse (57.1%) than older paediatric and adult patients. Of the patients who had achieved a \n\ncomplete response, 89.3% maintained response without relapsing. \n\n \n\nExperience from individual patients who achieved a complete response following dose escalation to \n\n600 mg (8 mg/kg) every 8 weeks suggests that a higher dose may be beneficial in patients not \n\nachieving complete response or not maintaining complete response with the recommended doses \n\n(150 mg or 2 mg/kg for patients ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg). An increased dose was administered more \n\nfrequently to patients aged 2 to < 4 years and to patients with NOMID/CINCA symptoms compared \n\nwith FCAS or MWS. \n\n \n\nA 6-year observational registry study was conducted to provide data on the long-term safety and \n\neffectiveness of canakinumab treatment in paediatric and adult CAPS patients in routine clinical \n\npractice. The study included 243 CAPS patients (including 85 patients less than 18 years of age). \n\nDisease activity was rated as absent or mild/moderate in more than 90% of patients at all post-baseline \n\ntime points in the study, and median serological markers of inflammation (CRP and SAA) were \n\nnormal (< 10 mg/litre) at all post-baseline time points. Although approximately 22% of patients \n\nreceiving canakinumab required dose adjustment, only a small percentage of patients (1.2%) \n\ndiscontinued canakinumab due to lack of therapeutic effect. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe CAPS interventional trials with canakinumab included a total of 80 paediatric patients with an age \n\nrange from 2 to 17 years (approximately half of them treated on an mg/kg basis). Overall, there were \n\nno clinically meaningful differences in the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of canakinumab in \n\npaediatric patients compared to the overall CAPS population. The majority of paediatric patients \n\nachieved improvement in clinical symptoms and objective markers of inflammation (e.g. SAA and \n\nCRP). \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nA 56-week, open-label study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of \n\ncanakinumab in paediatric CAPS patients ≤ 4 years of age. Seventeen patients (including 6 patients \n\nunder the age of 2 years) were evaluated, using weight-based starting doses of 2-8 mg/kg. The study \n\nalso evaluated the effect of canakinumab on the development of antibodies to standard childhood \n\nvaccines. No differences in safety or efficacy were observed in patients under the age of 2 years \n\ncompared with patients aged 2 years and above. All patients who received non-live, standard of care \n\nchildhood vaccinations (N=7) developed protective antibody levels. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\nThe efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF were \n\ndemonstrated in a single, pivotal, phase III, 4-part study (N2301) consisting of three separate disease \n\ncohorts. \n\n- Part I: Patients in each disease cohort aged 2 years and older entered a 12-week screening period \nduring which they were evaluated for the onset of disease flare. \n\n- Part II: Patients at flare onset were randomised into a 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled \ntreatment period during which they received either 150 mg canakinumab (2 mg/kg for patients \n\nwith body weight ≤ 40 kg) subcutaneous (s.c.) or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients > 28 days but \n\n< 2 years of age were allowed to enter the study directly into an open-arm of Part II as non-\n\nrandomised patients (and were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis). \n\n- Part III: Patients who completed 16 weeks of treatment and were classified as responders were \nre-randomised into a 24-week, double-blind withdrawal period during which they received \n\ncanakinumab 150 mg (2 mg/kg for patients ≤ 40 kg) s.c. or placebo every 8 weeks. \n\n- Part IV: All Part III patients treated with canakinumab were eligible to enter into a 72-week \nopen-label treatment extension period. \n\n \n\nA total of 185 patients aged 28 days and above were enrolled and a total of 181 patients aged 2 years \n\nand above were randomised in part II of the study. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the randomised treatment period (Part II) was the proportion of \n\nresponders within each cohort who had resolution of their index disease flare at Day 15 and did not \n\nexperience a new flare during the remainder of the 16-week treatment period (defined as complete \n\nresponse). Resolution of the index disease flare was defined as having a Physician’s Global \n\nAssessment (PGA) of Disease Activity score < 2 (“minimal or no disease”) and CRP within normal \n\nrange (≤ 10 mg/l) or reduction ≥ 70% from baseline. A new flare was defined as a PGA score ≥ 2 \n\n(“mild, moderate, or severe disease”) and CRP ≥ 30 mg/l. Secondary endpoints, all based on week 16 \n\nresults (end of Part II), included the proportion of patients who achieved a PGA score of < 2, the \n\nproportion of patients with serological remission (defined as CRP ≤ 10 mg/l), and the proportion of \n\npatients with a normalised SAA level (defined as SAA ≤ 10 mg/l). \n\n \n\nFor the primary efficacy endpoint, canakinumab was superior to placebo for all three disease cohorts. \n\nCanakinumab also demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo on the secondary endpoints of \n\nPGA < 2 and CRP ≤ 10 mg/l in all three cohorts.

All up-titrated patients \n\nremained at the increased dose of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients ≤ 40 kg) every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory analysis of the primary endpoint, it was observed that in patients with an inadequate \n\nresponse after the first dose, an up-titration within the first month to a dose of 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg) \n\nevery 4 weeks further improved flare control, reduced disease activity and normalised CRP and SAA \n\nlevels. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients: \n\nTwo non-randomised HIDS/MKD patients aged > 28 days but < 2 years were included in the study \n\nand received canakinumab. One patient had resolution of index flare by day 15 after receiving one \n\nsingle dose of canakinumab 2 mg/kg, but discontinued treatment after this first dose due to serious \n\nadverse events (pancytopenia and hepatic failure). This patient presented at study entry with a history \n\nof immune thrombocytopenic purpura and an active medical condition of abnormal hepatic function. \n\nThe second patient received a starting dose of canakinumab 2 mg/kg and an add-on dose of 2 mg/kg at \n\nweek 3, and was up-titrated at week 5 to receive a dose of 4 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks until \n\nthe end of Part II of the study. Resolution of disease flare was achieved by week 5 and the patient had \n\nnot experienced any new flare at the end of Part II of the study (week 16). \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nSJIA \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of active SJIA was assessed in two pivotal phase III \n\nstudies (G2305 and G2301). Patients enrolled were aged 2 to < 20 years (mean age of 8.5 years and \n\nmean disease duration of 3.5 years at baseline) and had active disease defined as ≥ 2 joints with active \n\narthritis, fever and elevated CRP. \n\n \n\nStudy G2305 \n\nStudy G2305 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study assessing the short-\n\nterm efficacy of canakinumab in 84 patients randomised to receive a single dose of 4 mg/kg (up to \n\n300 mg) canakinumab or placebo. The primary objective was the proportion of patients at day 15 who \n\nachieved a minimum 30% improvement in the paediatric American College of Rheumatology (ACR) \n\nresponse criterion adapted to include absence of fever. Canakinumab treatment improved all paediatric \n\nACR response scores as compared to placebo at days 15 and 29 (Table 4). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Paediatric ACR response and disease status at days 15 and 29 \n\n \n\n Day 15 Day 29 \n\n Canakinumab \n\nN=43 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=41 \n\nCanakinumab \n\nN=43 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=41 \n\nACR30 84% 10% 81% 10% \n\nACR50 67% 5% 79% 5% \n\nACR70 61% 2% 67% 2% \n\nACR90 42% 0% 47% 2% \n\nACR100 33% 0% 33% 2% \n\nInactive disease 33% 0% 30% 0% \n\nTreatment difference for all ACR scores was significant (p ≤ 0.0001) \n\n \n\nResults for the components of the adapted paediatric ACR which included systemic and arthritic \n\ncomponents, were consistent with the overall ACR response results. At day 15, the median change \n\nfrom baseline in the number of joints with active arthritis and limited range of motion were -67% \n\nand -73% for canakinumab (N=43), respectively, compared to a median change of 0% and 0% for \n\nplacebo (N=41). The mean change in patient pain score (0-100 mm visual analogue scale) at day 15 \n\nwas -50.0 mm for canakinumab (N=43), as compared to +4.5 mm for placebo (N=25). The mean \n\nchange in pain score among canakinumab treated patients was consistent at day 29. \n\n \n\nStudy G2301 \n\nStudy G2301 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study of flare prevention \n\nby canakinumab. The study consisted of two parts with two independent primary endpoints (successful \n\nsteroid taper and time to flare). In Part I (open label) 177 patients were enrolled and received 4 mg/kg \n\n(up to 300 mg) canakinumab administered every 4 weeks for up to 32 weeks. Patients in Part II \n\n(double-blind) received either canakinumab 4 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks until 37 flare events \n\noccurred. \n\n \n\nCorticosteroid dose tapering: \n\nOf the total 128 patients who entered Part I taking corticosteroids, 92 attempted corticosteroid \n\ntapering. Fifty-seven (62%) of the 92 patients who attempted to taper were able to successfully taper \n\ntheir corticosteroid dose and 42 (46%) discontinued corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nTime to flare: \n\nPatients taking canakinumab in Part II had a 64% reduced risk of a flare event as compared to the \n\nplacebo group (hazard ratio of 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.75; p=0.0032). Sixty-three of the 100 patients \n\nentering Part II, whether assigned to placebo or canakinumab, did not experience a flare over the \n\nobservation period (up to a maximum of 80 weeks). \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes in studies G2305 and G2301 \n\nTreatment with canakinumab resulted in clinically relevant improvements in patients’ physical \n\nfunction and quality of life. In study G2305, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire Least \n\nSquares means improvement was 0.69 for canakinumab vs placebo representing 3.6 times the minimal \n\nclinically important difference of 0.19 (p=0.0002). The median improvement from baseline to end of \n\nPart I of study G2301 was 0.88 (79%). Statistically significant improvements in the Child Health \n\nQuestionnaire-PF50 scores were reported for canakinumab vs placebo in study G2305 (physical \n\np=0.0012; psychosocial well-being p=0.0017). \n\n \n\nPooled efficacy analysis \n\nData from the first 12 weeks of canakinumab treatment from studies G2305, G2301 and the extension \n\nstudy were pooled to assess maintenance of efficacy. These data showed similar improvements from \n\nbaseline to week 12 in the adapted paediatric ACR responses and its components to those observed in \n\nthe placebo controlled study (G2305). At week 12, the adapted paediatric ACR30, 50, 70, 90 and 100 \n\nresponses were: 70%, 69%, 61%, 49% and 30%, respectively and 28% of patients had inactive disease \n\n(N=178). \n\n \n\nAlthough limited, evidence from the clinical trials suggests that patients not responding to tocilizumab \n\nor anakinra may respond to canakinumab. \n\n \n\nStudy G2301E1 \n\nThe efficacy observed in the studies G2305 and G2301 was maintained in the open-label long-term \n\nextension study G2301E1. Of the 270 SJIA patients in the study, 147 patients had received treatment \n\nwith canakinumab in studies G2305 or G2301 (Cohort I), and 123 patients were canakinumab-naive \n\npatients (Cohort II). Patients in Cohort I were treated for a median duration of 3.2 years (up to \n\n5.2 years), and patients in Cohort II were treated for a median duration of 1.8 years (up to 2.8 years). \n\nIn the extension study, all patients received canakinumab 4 mg/kg (up to maximum 300 mg) every \n\n4 weeks. In both cohorts, patients who were well-controlled responders (retrospectively defined as \n\nadapted paediatric ACR ≥ 90) and who did not require a concomitant corticosteroid were permitted to \n\nreduce their canakinumab dose to 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks (62/270; 23%). \n\n \n\nStudy G2306 \n\nStudy G2306 was an open-label study to assess maintenance of treatment response with canakinumab \n\ndose reduction (2 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or dose interval prolongation (4 mg/kg every 8 weeks) in \n\nSJIA patients who were receiving canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Seventy five patients aged 2 \n\nto 22 years who maintained inactive disease status for at least 6 consecutive months (clinical \n\nremission) with canakinumab monotherapy, including patients who were able to maintain inactive \n\ndisease status with discontinuation of concomitant corticosteroid and/or methotrexate use for at least \n\n4 weeks, were randomised to receive canakinumab 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks (N=38) or canakinumab \n\n4 mg/kg every 8 weeks (N=37). After 24 weeks, 71% (27/38) of patients who received the reduced \n\ndose (2 mg/kg every 4 weeks) and 84% (31/37) of patients who received the prolonged dosing interval \n\n(4 mg/kg every 8 weeks) were able to maintain inactive disease status for 6 months. Of the patients in \n\nclinical remission who continued with further dose reduction (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or dose interval \n\nprolongation (4 mg/kg every 12 weeks), 93% (26/28) and 91% (30/33) of patients, respectively, were \n\nable to maintain inactive disease status for 6 months. Patients who maintained inactive disease status \n\nfor 6 additional months at this lowest dose regimen were allowed to discontinue canakinumab. \n\nOverall, 33% (25/75) of patients randomised to dose reduction or dose interval prolongation arms \n\nwere able to discontinue treatment with canakinumab and maintain inactive disease status for \n\n6 months. The rate of adverse events in both treatment arms was similar to the rate seen in patients \n\ntreated with canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nAOSD \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab 4 mg/kg (up to maximum 300 mg) administered every 4 weeks in AOSD \n\npatients in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study in 36 patients (22 to 70 years old) was \n\ncomparable to that observed in SJIA patients. In study GDE01T, a higher proportion of patients \n\n(12/18, 66.7%) in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group (7/17, 41.2%) demonstrated an \n\nimprovement from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-\n\nESR) of > 1.2 at week 12, which failed to reach statistical significance (odds ratio 2.86, treatment \n\ndifference [%] 25.49 [95% CI: 9.43, 55.80]). By week 4, 7 of 18 patients (38.9%) treated with \n\ncanakinumab had already achieved DAS28-ESR remission versus 2 of 17 patients (11.8%) on placebo. \n\nThese data are consistent with the results of a pooled efficacy analysis of 418 SJIA patients which \n\nshowed that the efficacy of canakinumab in a subset of SJIA patients aged 16 to < 20 years (n=34) was \n\nconsistent with the efficacy observed in patients less than 16 years of age (n=384). \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nThe efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis attacks was demonstrated in two \n\nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with frequent gouty \n\narthritis (≥ 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) unable to use NSAIDs or colchicine (due to \n\ncontraindication, intolerance or lack of efficacy). The studies were 12 weeks followed by 12-week \n\ndouble-blind extension. A total of 225 patients were treated with subcutaneous canakinumab 150 mg \n\nand 229 patients were treated with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 40 mg at study entry, \n\nand when experiencing a new attack thereafter. The mean number of gouty arthritis attacks in the \n\nprevious 12 months was 6.5. Over 85% of patients had comorbidity, including hypertension (60%), \n\ndiabetes (15%), ischaemic heart disease (12%), and stage ≥ 3 chronic kidney disease (25%). \n\nApproximately one-third of the patients enrolled (76 [33.8%] in the canakinumab group and 84 \n\n[36.7%] in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had documented inability (intolerance, contraindication \n\nor lack of response) to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. Concomitant treatment with ULTs was \n\nreported by 42% of patients at entry. \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints were: (i) gouty arthritis pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) at \n\n72 hours post-dose, and (ii) time to first new gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nFor the overall study population, pain intensity was statistically significantly lower for canakinumab \n\n150 mg compared with triamcinolone acetonide at 72 hours. Canakinumab also reduced the risk of \n\nsubsequent attacks (see Table 5). \n\n \n\nEfficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on \n\nULT, failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study \n\npopulation with a statistically significant difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide in pain \n\nintensity at 72 hours (-10.2 mm, p=0.0208) and in reduction of risk of subsequent attacks (Hazard ratio \n\n0.39, p=0.0047 at 24 weeks). \n\n \n\nEfficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) are presented in \n\nTable 5. Treatment with canakinumab induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent \n\nattacks in patients using ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine, although the observed \n\ntreatment difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was less pronounced than with the overall \n\nstudy population. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nTable 5 Efficacy for the overall study population and in a subgroup of patients currently \n\nusing ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine \n\n \n\nEfficacy endpoint Overall study population;  \n\nN=454 \n\nUnable to use both NSAIDs \n\nand colchicine; on ULT \n\nN=62 \n\nTreatment of gouty arthritis attacks as measured by pain intensity (VAS) at 72 h \n\nLeast Squares mean estimated \n\ndifference to triamcinolone acetonide \n\nCI \n\np-value, 1-sided \n\n-10.7 \n\n \n\n(-15.4, -6.0) \n\np < 0.0001* \n\n-3.8 \n\n \n\n(-16.7, 9.1) \n\np=0.2798 \n\nRisk reduction of subsequent gouty arthritis attacks as measured by time to first new flare \n\n(24 weeks) \n\nHazard ratio to triamcinolone \n\nacetonide \n\nCI \n\np-value, 1-sided \n\n0.44 \n\n \n\n(0.32, 0.60) \n\np < 0.0001* \n\n0.71 \n\n \n\n(0.29, 1.77) \n\np=0.2337 \n\n* Denotes significant p-value ≤ 0.025 \n\n \n\nSafety results showed an increased incidence of adverse events for canakinumab compared to \n\ntriamcinolone acetonide, with 66% vs 53% of patients reporting any adverse event and 20% vs 10% of \n\npatients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nOverall, the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of canakinumab in elderly patients ≥ 65 years of \n\nage was comparable to patients < 65 years of age. \n\n \n\nPatients on urate lowering therapy (ULT) \n\nIn clinical studies, canakinumab has been safely administered with ULT. In the overall study \n\npopulation, patients on ULT had a less pronounced treatment difference in both pain reduction and \n\nreduction in the risk of subsequent gouty arthritis attacks compared to patients not on ULT. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAntibodies against canakinumab were observed in approximately 1.5%, 3% and 2% of the patients \n\ntreated with canakinumab for CAPS, SJIA and gouty arthritis, respectively. No neutralising antibodies \n\nwere detected. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events \n\nwas observed. \n\n \n\nThere were no antibodies against canakinumab observed in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients \n\ntreated with doses of 150 mg and 300 mg over 16 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe Marketing Authorisation Holder has completed four Paediatric Investigation Plans for \n\ncanakinumab (for CAPS, SJIA, FMF – HIDS/MKD and TRAPS respectively). This product \n\ninformation has been updated to include the results of studies with canakinumab in the paediatric \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ncanakinumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in gouty arthritis (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nCAPS \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe peak serum canakinumab concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately 7 days following single \n\nsubcutaneous administration of 150 mg in adult CAPS patients. The mean terminal half-life was \n\n26 days. Mean values for Cmax and AUCinf after a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg in a typical \n\nadult CAPS patient (70 kg) were 15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml. The absolute bioavailability of \n\nsubcutaneously administered canakinumab was estimated to be 66%. Exposure parameters (such as \n\nAUC and Cmax) increased in proportion to dose over the dose range of 0.30 to 10.0 mg/kg given as \n\nintravenous infusion or from 150 to 600 mg as subcutaneous injection. Predicted steady-state exposure \n\nvalues (Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, AUC,ss,8w) after 150 mg subcutaneous administration (or 2 mg/kg, respectively) \n\nevery 8 weeks were slightly higher in the weight category 40-70 kg (6.6 µg/ml, 24.3 µg/ml, \n\n767 µg*d/ml) compared to the weight categories < 40 kg (4.0 µg/ml, 19.9 µg/ml, 566 µg*d/ml) and \n\n> 70 kg (4.6 µg/ml, 17.8 µg/ml, 545 µg*d/ml). The expected accumulation ratio was 1.3-fold \n\nfollowing 6 months of subcutaneous administration of 150 mg canakinumab every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nCanakinumab binds to serum IL-1 beta. The distribution volume (Vss) of canakinumab varied \n\naccording to body weight. It was estimated to be 6.2 litres in a CAPS patient of body weight 70 kg. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of canakinumab increases with body weight. It was estimated to be \n\n0.17 l/d in a CAPS patient of body weight 70 kg and 0.11 l/d in a SJIA patient of body weight 33 kg. \n\nAfter accounting for body weight differences, no clinically significant differences in the \n\npharmacokinetic properties of canakinumab were observed between CAPS and SJIA patients. \n\n \n\nThere was no indication of accelerated clearance or time-dependent change in the pharmacokinetic \n\nproperties of canakinumab following repeated administration. No gender or age-related \n\npharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for body weight. \n\n \n\nTRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF \n\n \n\nBioavailability in TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF patients has not been determined independently. \n\nApparent clearance (CL/F) in the TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF population at body weight of 55 kg \n\n(0.14 l/d) was comparable to CAPS population at body weight of 70 kg (0.17 l/d). The apparent \n\nvolume of distribution (V/F) was 4.96 l at body weight of 55 kg. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 150 mg every 4 weeks, canakinumab minimal \n\nconcentration at week 16 (Cmin) was estimated to be 15.4 ± 6.6 g/ml. The estimated steady state \n\nAUCtau was 636.7 ± 260.2 μg*d/ml. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\n \n\nBioavailability in SJIA patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance per kg \n\nbody weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the SJIA and CAPS population (0.004 l/d per \n\nkg). The apparent volume of distribution per kg (V/F per kg) was 0.14 l/kg. Sparse pharmacokinetics \n\n(PK) data in AOSD patients suggest similar PK of canakinumab as compared to SJIA and other patient \n\npopulations. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated administration of 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks the accumulation ratio of canakinumab was \n\n1.6 fold in SJIA patients. Steady state was reached after 110 days. The overall predicted mean (±SD) \n\nfor Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC,ss4w were 14.7±8.8 μg/ml, 36.5 ± 14.9 μg/ml and 696.1 ± 326.5 μg*d/ml, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nThe AUCss4w in each age group was 692, 615, 707 and 742 µg*d/ml for 2-3, 4-5, 6-11, and 12-19 years \n\nold, respectively. When stratified by weight, a lower (30-40%) median of exposure for Cmin,ss (11.4 vs \n\n19 µg/ml) and AUCss (594 vs 880 µg*d/ml) for the lower bodyweight category (≤ 40 kg) vs the higher \n\nbodyweight category (> 40 kg) was observed. \n\n \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in \n\nyoung adult SJIA patients aged 16 to 20 years were similar to those in patients less than 16 years of \n\nage. Predicted canakinumab steady state exposures at a dose level of 4 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) in \n\npatients over the age of 20 years were comparable to those in SJIA patients younger than 20 years of \n\nage. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis population \n\n \n\nBioavailability in gouty arthritis patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance \n\nper kg body weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the gouty arthritis and CAPS population \n\n(0.004 l/d/kg). Mean exposure in a typical gouty arthritis patient (93 kg) after a single subcutaneous \n\n150 mg dose (Cmax: 10.8 µg/ml and AUCinf: 495 µg*d/ml) was lower than in a typical 70 kg CAPS \n\npatient (15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml). This is consistent with the observed increase in CL/F with body \n\nweight. \n\n \n\nThe expected accumulation ratio was 1.1-fold following subcutaneous administration of 150 mg \n\ncanakinumab every 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nPeak concentrations of canakinumab occurred between 2 to 7 days (Tmax) following single \n\nsubcutaneous administration of canakinumab 150 mg or 2 mg/kg in paediatric patients 4 years of age \n\nand older. The terminal half-life ranged from 22.9 to 25.7 days, similar to the pharmacokinetic \n\nproperties observed in adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the \n\npharmacokinetics of canakinumab in children aged 2 to < 4 years were similar to those in patients \n\n4 years of age and older. Subcutaneous absorption rate was estimated to decrease with age and \n\nappeared to be fastest in the youngest patients. Accordingly, Tmax was shorter (3.6 days) in younger \n\nSJIA patients (2-3 years) compared to older SJIA patients (12-19 years; Tmax 6 days). Bioavailability \n\n(AUCss) was not affected. \n\n \n\nAn additional pharmacokinetics analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in \n\n6 paediatric CAPS patients under the age of 2 years were similar to the pharmacokinetics in paediatric \n\npatients 2-4 years of age. Based on the population pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, the expected \n\nexposures after a dose of 2 mg/kg were comparable across the CAPS paediatric age groups, but were \n\napproximately 40% lower in paediatric patients of very low body weight (e.g. 10 kg) than in adult \n\npatients (150 mg dose). This is consistent with the observations of higher exposure in higher body \n\nweight groups in CAPS patients. \n\n \n\nIn TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF, exposure parameters (trough concentrations) were comparable \n\nacross age groups from 2 to < 20 years old following subcutaneous administration of canakinumab \n\n2 mg/kg every 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic properties are similar in CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA paediatric \n\npopulations. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\n \n\nNo change in pharmacokinetic parameters based on clearance or volume of distribution were observed \n\nbetween elderly patients and adult patients < 65 years of age. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of cross-\n\nreactivity, repeated dose toxicity, immunotoxicity, toxicity to reproduce and development. \n\n \n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with canakinumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Ilaris is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ilaris \n\n3. How to use Ilaris \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Ilaris \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Ilaris is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Ilaris is \n\nIlaris contains the active substance canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called interleukin inhibitors. It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta \n\n(IL-1 beta) in the body, which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases. \n\n \n\nWhat Ilaris is used for \n\nIlaris is used for treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n- Periodic fever syndromes: \n\n Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), \n\n Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), \n\n Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), \n\n Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). \n- Still’s disease including adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis (SJIA) \n\n- Gouty arthritis \n \n\nMore information on each of these diseases is given below. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n\nPeriodic fever syndromes \n\nIlaris is used in adults and children aged 2 years and older to treat the following: \n\n- Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) – this is a group of auto-inflammatory \ndiseases, which include: \n\n Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \n\n Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also called chronic infantile \nneurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), \n\n Severe forms of familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold \nurticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin \n\nrash. \n\n- Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) \n- Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency \n\n(MKD) \n\n- Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): Ilaris is used to treat FMF. Ilaris can be used together with \ncolchicine, if appropriate. \n\n \n\nIn patients with periodic fever syndromes (CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF), the body produces \n\ntoo much IL-1 beta. This may cause fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. \n\nBy blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may improve these symptoms. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease \n\nIlaris is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat active Still’s disease including adult-onset \n\nStill’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and \n\nolder if other treatments have not worked well enough. Ilaris can be used alone or in combination with \n\nmethotrexate. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease including SJIA and AOSD is an inflammatory disease that can cause pain, swelling and \n\ninflammation of one or more joints, as well as rash and fever. A pro-inflammatory protein called IL-1 \n\nbeta plays an important role in Still’s disease inflammation. Ilaris blocks the activity of IL-1 beta, \n\nwhich may improve the signs and symptoms of Still’s disease. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nIlaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have \n\nnot worked well enough. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis is caused by the formation of urate crystals. These crystals cause excessive production \n\nof IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint \n\n(known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may lead to an \n\nimprovement in these symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ilaris \n\n \n\nDo not use Ilaris \n\n- if you are allergic to canakinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you have, or suspect you have, an active and severe infection. \n \n\nWarning and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you: \n\n if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a \nknown low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections. \n\n if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active \ntuberculosis infection. Your doctor may check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific \n\ntest. \n\n if you have signs of a liver disorder such as yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark-\ncoloured urine and light-coloured stools. \n\n if you need to have any vaccinations. You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of \nvaccine called a live vaccine while being treated with Ilaris (see also “Other medicines and \n\nIlaris”). \n\n \n\nStill’s disease \n\n Patients with Still’s disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome \n(MAS), which can be life-threatening. Your doctor will monitor you for potential triggering \n\nfactors of MAS that include infections and re-activation of the underlying Still’s disease (flare). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA: Ilaris can be used in children aged 2 years and \nolder. \n\n Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \n\nOther medicines and Ilaris \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n Live vaccines: You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of vaccine called a live \nvaccine while you are being treated with Ilaris. Your doctor may want to check your vaccination \n\nhistory and give you any vaccinations that you have missed before you start treatment with \n\nIlaris. If you need to be given a live vaccine after starting treatment with Ilaris, discuss this with \n\nyour doctor. A live vaccine should normally be given 3 months after your last injection of Ilaris \n\nand 3 months before the next one. \n\n Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as etanercept, adalimumab or \ninfliximab. These are used mainly in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. They should not be \n\nused with Ilaris because this may increase the risk of infections. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using \nIlaris and for at least 3 months after the last Ilaris treatment. It is important to tell your doctor if \n\nyou are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \n\nwill discuss with you the potential risks of taking Ilaris during pregnancy. \n\n If you received canakinumab while you were pregnant, it is important that you inform the \nbaby’s doctor or nurse before any vaccinations are given to your baby. Your baby should not \n\nreceive live vaccines until at least 16 weeks after you received your last dose of canakinumab \n\nbefore giving birth. \n\n It is not known whether Ilaris passes into human milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the \npotential risks of taking Ilaris before breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIlaris treatment may give you a spinning sensation (dizziness or vertigo) or intense tiredness \n\n(asthenia). This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel a spinning \n\nsensation or feel tired, do not drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling normal again. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Ilaris \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nKeep your doctor informed of your condition and any symptoms before you use or are given Ilaris (see \n\nsection 2). Your doctor may decide to delay or interrupt your treatment, but only if necessary. \n\n \n\nIlaris is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short needle into the \n\nfatty tissue just under the skin. \n\n \n\nIf you have gouty arthritis, your treatment will be overseen by a doctor with specialist training. Ilaris \n\nshould be injected by a healthcare professional only. \n\n \n\nIf you have CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA), you may inject \n\nyourself with Ilaris after proper training, or a caregiver may inject it for you. \n\n \n\nHow much Ilaris to use \n\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Ilaris is: \n\n- Adults and children aged 4 years or more \n\n 150 mg for patients who weigh more than 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 15 kg and 40 kg \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 7.5 kg and less than 15 kg \n- Children aged 2 or 3 years \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients with body weight of 7.5 kg or more \n \n\nIlaris is injected every 8 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\n If you have not responded well enough to the treatment after 7 days, your doctor may give you \nanother dose of 150 mg or 2 mg/kg. \n\n If you respond well enough to the second dose, your treatment will be continued with 300 mg or \n4 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n If you do not respond well enough to the second dose, a third dose of Ilaris at 300 mg or \n4 mg/kg may be given. \n\n If you respond well enough to the third dose, your treatment will be continued at 600 mg or \n8 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nFor children given a starting dose of 4 mg/kg who have not responded well enough after 7 days, the \n\ndoctor may give a second dose of 4 mg/kg. If the child responds well enough to this, treatment may be \n\ncontinued with a dose of 8 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nTumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D \n\nsyndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Ilaris is: \n\n- Adults and children aged 2 years or more \n\n 150 mg for patients who weigh more than 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 7.5 kg and less than 40 kg \n \n\nIlaris is injected every 4 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\n- If you have not responded well enough to the treatment after 7 days, your doctor may give you \nanother dose of 150 mg or 2 mg/kg. \n\n- If you respond well enough to this, your treatment will be continued with 300 mg or 4 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nThe recommended dose of Ilaris for patients with Still’s disease with body weight of 7.5 kg and above \n\nis 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 300 mg). Ilaris is injected every 4 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you the need to start or adjust a urate lowering therapy to lower the uric \n\nacid level in your blood. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Ilaris for adult gouty arthritis patients is 150 mg given as a single dose at \n\nthe time of a gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nIf you need another treatment with Ilaris, and got relief from the last dose, you must wait at least \n\n12 weeks before the next dose. \n\n \n\nInjecting Ilaris yourself or injecting a patient with Ilaris \n\nIf you are a patient with CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA), or a \n\ncaregiver of a patient with one of these conditions, you may administer Ilaris injections yourself after \n\nproper training in the correct injection technique. \n\n The patient or caregiver and the doctor should decide together who will administer the Ilaris \ninjections. \n\n The doctor or nurse will demonstrate how to administer Ilaris injections. \n\n Do not try to administer an injection yourself if you have not been properly trained or if you are \nnot sure how to do it. \n\n Ilaris 150 mg powder for solution for injection is supplied in a single-use vial for individual use. \n\n Never re-use the leftover solution. \n \n\nFor instructions on how to administer Ilaris injections, please read the section “Instructions for use” at \n\nthe end of this leaflet.

If \nyou experience a new attack, your doctor may consider giving you a new dose of Ilaris but not \n\nearlier than 12 weeks from the previous dose. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Ilaris than you should \n\nIf you accidentally inject more Ilaris than the recommended dose, it is unlikely to be serious, but you \n\nshould inform your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nIf you forget to use Ilaris \n\nIf you have CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA) and have forgotten \n\nto inject a dose of Ilaris, inject the next dose as soon as you remember. Then talk to the doctor to \n\ndiscuss when you should inject the next dose. You should then continue with injections at the \n\nrecommended intervals as before. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Ilaris \n\nStopping your treatment with Ilaris may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking Ilaris \n\nunless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Do not use after the expiry date which is stated \non the label and carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n Always use new, unopened needles and syringes. Avoid touching the needles and the tops of the \nvials. \n\n \n\nGather together the necessary items \n\nIncluded in the pack \n\n- one vial of Ilaris powder for solution for injection (keep refrigerated) \n \n\nNot included in the pack \n\n one vial (or ampoule) of sterile water for injections (“water”) (at room temperature) \n\n one 1.0 ml syringe \n\n one 18 G x 2 inch (50 mm) needle for reconstituting the powder (“transfer needle”) \n\n one 27 G x 0.5 inch (13 mm) needle for injecting (“injection needle”) \n\n alcohol swabs \n\n clean, dry cotton swabs \n\n an adhesive plaster \n\n a proper disposal container for used needles, syringe and vials (sharps container) \n \n\n \n\nMixing Ilaris \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Remove the caps from the Ilaris and water vials. \nDo not touch the vial stoppers. Clean the stoppers \n\nwith the alcohol swab. \n\n2. Open the wrappers containing the syringe and the \ntransfer needle (the 50 mm needle) and attach the \n\nneedle to the syringe. \n\n3. Carefully remove the cap from the transfer needle \nand set the cap aside. Pull the plunger all the way \n\ndown to the 1.0 ml mark, filling the syringe with \n\nair. Insert the needle into the water vial through the \n\ncentre of the rubber stopper. \n\n4. Gently push the plunger all the way down until air \nis in the vial. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n5. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and bring to \neye level. \n\n6. Make sure the tip of the transfer needle is covered \nby the water and slowly pull the syringe plunger \n\ndown to slightly past the 1.0 ml mark. If you see \n\nbubbles in the syringe, remove bubbles as \n\ninstructed by your healthcare professional or \n\npharmacist. \n\n7. Make sure 1.0 ml of water is in the syringe, then \ntake the needle out of the vial. (There will be water \n\nremaining in the vial.) \n\n \n\n8. Insert the transfer needle through the centre of the \nstopper of the vial of Ilaris powder, taking care not \n\nto touch the needle or the stopper. Slowly inject the \n\nwater into the vial containing the Ilaris powder. \n\n9. Carefully remove the transfer needle from the vial \nand recap the needle as instructed by your \n\nhealthcare provider or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n10. Without touching the rubber stopper, swirl (do not \nshake) the vial slowly at an angle of about \n\n45 degrees for about 1 minute. Allow to stand for \n\n5 minutes. \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n11. Now, gently turn the vial upside down and back \nagain ten times, again taking care not to touch the \n\nrubber stopper. \n\n12. Allow to stand for about 15 minutes at room \ntemperature to get a clear to opalescent solution. \n\nDo not shake. Do not use if particles are present in \n\nthe solution. \n\n13. Make sure all of the solution is in the bottom of the \nvial. If drops remain on the stopper, tap the side of \n\nthe vial to remove them. The solution should be \n\nclear to opalescent and free of visible particles. The \n\nsolution should be colourless or may have a slight \n\nbrownish-yellow tint. \n\n- If not used immediately after mixing, the \nsolution should be stored in the refrigerator \n\n(2°C to 8°C) and used within 24 hours. \n\n \n\n \n\nPreparing the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n14. Clean the rubber stopper of the vial containing the \nIlaris solution with a new alcohol swab. \n\n15. Uncap the transfer needle again. Pull the plunger of \nthe syringe all the way down to the 1.0 ml mark, \n\nfilling the syringe with air. Insert the syringe \n\nneedle into the vial of Ilaris solution through the \n\ncentre of the rubber stopper. The needle should not \n\nbe in the liquid at this point. Gently push the \n\nplunger all the way down until all of the air is \n\ninjected into the vial. Do not inject air into the \n\nliquid. \n\n \n\n16. Do not turn the vial and syringe upside down, the \nvial should stay upright. Insert the needle all the \n\nway into the vial until it reaches the bottom edge. \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n17. Tip the vial to ensure that the required amount of \nsolution can be drawn into the syringe \n\n18. NOTE: The required amount depends on the dose \nto be administered. Your healthcare provider will \n\ninstruct you on the right amount for you. \n\n19. Slowly pull the syringe plunger up to the correct \nmark (amount to be given), filling the syringe with \n\nIlaris solution. If there are air bubbles in the \n\nsyringe, remove bubbles as instructed by your \n\nhealthcare provider. Ensure that the correct amount \n\nof solution is in the syringe. \n\n20. Remove the syringe and needle from the vial. \n(There may be solution remaining in the vial.) \n\nRecap the transfer needle as instructed by your \n\nhealthcare provider or pharmacist. Remove the \n\ntransfer needle from the syringe. Place the transfer \n\nneedle in the sharps container. \n\n21. Open the wrapper containing the injection needle \nand attach the needle to the syringe. Set the syringe \n\naside. \n\n \n\n \n\nGiving the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n22. Choose an injection site on the upper thigh, \nabdomen, upper arm or buttocks. Do not use an \n\narea that has a rash or broken skin, or is bruised or \n\nlumpy. Do not inject into scar-tissue as this may \n\nmean you do not get all of your medicine. Avoid \n\ninjecting into a vein. \n\n23. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. \nAllow the area to dry. Uncap the injection needle. \n\n24. Gently pinch the skin up at the injection site. Hold \nthe syringe at a 90-degree angle and in a single, \n\nsmooth motion, push the needle straight down \n\ncompletely into the skin. \n\n \n\n25. Keep the needle all the way in the skin while \nslowly pushing the syringe plunger down until the \n\nbarrel is empty. Release the pinched skin and pull \n\nthe needle straight out. Dispose of the needle and \n\nsyringe in the sharps container without recapping \n\nor removing the needle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nAfter the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n26. Do not rub the injection area. If bleeding occurs, \napply a clean, dry cotton swab over the area, and \n\npress gently for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bleeding \n\nstops. Then apply an adhesive plaster. \n\n \n\n \n\n27. Safely dispose of needles and syringe in the sharps \ncontainer or as directed by your healthcare provider \n\nor pharmacist. Never re-use syringes or needles. \n\n28. Properly dispose of vials containing remaining \nwater and Ilaris solution (if any) as directed by \n\nyour healthcare provider or pharmacist. Any \n\nunused product or waste material should be \n\ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nKeep the sharps container out of reach of children. \n\n \n\nDispose of it as directed by your healthcare provider or \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nIlaris 150 mg/ml solution for injection \n\ncanakinumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta \n\n(IL-1 beta) in the body, which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases. \n\n \n\nWhat Ilaris is used for \n\nIlaris is used for treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n- Periodic fever syndromes: \n\n Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), \n\n Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), \n\n Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), \n\n Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). \n- Still’s disease including adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis (SJIA) \n\n- Gouty arthritis \n \n\nMore information on each of these diseases is given below. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n83 \n\nPeriodic fever syndromes \n\nIlaris is used in adults and children aged 2 years and older to treat the following: \n\n- Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) – this is a group of auto-inflammatory \ndiseases, which include: \n\n Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), \n\n Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also called chronic infantile \nneurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), \n\n Severe forms of familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold \nurticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin \n\nrash. \n\n- Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) \n- Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency \n\n(MKD) \n\n- Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): Ilaris is used to treat FMF. Ilaris can be used together with \ncolchicine, if appropriate. \n\n \n\nIn patients with periodic fever syndromes (CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF), the body produces \n\ntoo much IL-1 beta. This may cause fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. \n\nBy blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may improve these symptoms. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease \n\nIlaris is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat active Still’s disease including adult-onset \n\nStill’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and \n\nolder if other treatments have not worked well enough. Ilaris can be used alone or in combination with \n\nmethotrexate. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease including SJIA and AOSD is an inflammatory disease that can cause pain, swelling and \n\ninflammation of one or more joints, as well as rash and fever. A pro-inflammatory protein called IL-1 \n\nbeta plays an important role in Still’s disease inflammation. Ilaris blocks the activity of IL-1 beta, \n\nwhich may improve the signs and symptoms of Still’s disease. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nIlaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have \n\nnot worked well enough. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis is caused by the formation of urate crystals. These crystals cause excessive production \n\nof IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint \n\n(known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may lead to an \n\nimprovement in these symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ilaris \n\n \n\nDo not use Ilaris \n\n- if you are allergic to canakinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you have, or suspect you have, an active and severe infection. \n \n\nWarning and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you: \n\n if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a \nknown low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections. \n\n if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active \ntuberculosis infection. Your doctor may check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific \n\ntest. \n\n if you have signs of a liver disorder such as yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark-\ncoloured urine and light-coloured stools. \n\n if you need to have any vaccinations. You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of \nvaccine called a live vaccine while being treated with Ilaris (see also “Other medicines and \n\nIlaris”). \n\n \n\nStill’s disease \n\n Patients with Still’s disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome \n(MAS), which can be life-threatening. Your doctor will monitor you for potential triggering \n\nfactors of MAS that include infections and re-activation of the underlying Still’s disease (flare). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA: Ilaris can be used in children aged 2 years and \nolder. \n\n Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \n\nOther medicines and Ilaris \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n Live vaccines: You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of vaccine called a live \nvaccine while you are being treated with Ilaris. Your doctor may want to check your vaccination \n\nhistory and give you any vaccinations that you have missed before you start treatment with \n\nIlaris. If you need to be given a live vaccine after starting treatment with Ilaris, discuss this with \n\nyour doctor. A live vaccine should normally be given 3 months after your last injection of Ilaris \n\nand 3 months before the next one. \n\n Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as etanercept, adalimumab or \ninfliximab. These are used mainly in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. They should not be \n\nused with Ilaris because this may increase the risk of infections. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using \nIlaris and for at least 3 months after the last Ilaris treatment. It is important to tell your doctor if \n\nyou are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor \n\nwill discuss with you the potential risks of taking Ilaris during pregnancy. \n\n If you received canakinumab while you were pregnant, it is important that you inform the \nbaby’s doctor or nurse before any vaccinations are given to your baby. Your baby should not \n\nreceive live vaccines until at least 16 weeks after you received your last dose of canakinumab \n\nbefore giving birth. \n\n It is not known whether Ilaris passes into human milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the \npotential risks of taking Ilaris before breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIlaris treatment may give you a spinning sensation (dizziness or vertigo) or intense tiredness \n\n(asthenia). This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel a spinning \n\nsensation or feel tired, do not drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling normal again. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Ilaris \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nKeep your doctor informed of your condition and any symptoms before you use or are given Ilaris (see \n\nsection 2). Your doctor may decide to delay or interrupt your treatment, but only if necessary. \n\n \n\nIlaris is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short needle into the \n\nfatty tissue just under the skin. \n\n \n\nIf you have gouty arthritis, your treatment will be overseen by a doctor with specialist training. Ilaris \n\nshould be injected by a healthcare professional only. \n\n \n\nIf you have CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA), you may inject \n\nyourself with Ilaris after proper training, or a caregiver may inject it for you. \n\n \n\nHow much Ilaris to use \n\nCryopyrin- associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Ilaris is: \n\n- Adults and children aged 4 years or more \n\n 150 mg for patients who weigh more than 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 15 kg and 40 kg \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 7.5 kg and less than 15 kg \n- Children aged 2 or 3 years \n\n 4 mg/kg for patients with body weight of 7.5 kg or more \n \n\nIlaris is injected every 8 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\n If you have not responded well enough to the treatment after 7 days, your doctor may give you \nanother dose of 150 mg or 2 mg/kg. \n\n If you respond well enough to the second dose, your treatment will be continued with 300 mg or \n4 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n If you do not respond well enough to the second dose, a third dose of Ilaris at 300 mg or \n4 mg/kg may be given. \n\n If you respond well enough to the third dose, your treatment will be continued at 600 mg or \n8 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nFor children given a starting dose of 4 mg/kg who have not responded well enough after 7 days, the \n\ndoctor may give a second dose of 4 mg/kg. If the child responds well enough to this, treatment may be \n\ncontinued with a dose of 8 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nTumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D \n\nsyndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Ilaris is: \n\n- Adults and children aged 2 years or more \n\n 150 mg for patients who weigh more than 40 kg \n\n 2 mg/kg for patients who weigh between 7.5 kg and less than 40 kg \n \n\nIlaris is injected every 4 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\n- If you have not responded well enough to the treatment after 7 days, your doctor may give you \nanother dose of 150 mg or 2 mg/kg. \n\n- If you respond well enough to this, your treatment will be continued with 300 mg or 4 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nStill’s disease (SJIA and AOSD) \n\nThe recommended dose of Ilaris for patients with Still’s disease with body weight of 7.5 kg and above \n\nis 4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 300 mg). Ilaris is injected every 4 weeks as a single dose. \n\n \n\nGouty arthritis \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you the need to start or adjust a urate lowering therapy to lower the uric \n\nacid level in your blood. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Ilaris for adult gouty arthritis patients is 150 mg given as a single dose at \n\nthe time of a gouty arthritis attack. \n\n \n\nIf you need another treatment with Ilaris, and got relief from the last dose, you must wait at least \n\n12 weeks before the next dose. \n\n \n\nInjecting Ilaris yourself or injecting a patient with Ilaris \n\nIf you are a patient with CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA), or a \n\ncaregiver of a patient with one of these conditions, you may administer Ilaris injections yourself after \n\nproper training in the correct injection technique. \n\n The patient or caregiver and the doctor should decide together who will administer the Ilaris \ninjections. \n\n The doctor or nurse will demonstrate how to administer Ilaris injections. \n\n Do not try to administer an injection yourself if you have not been properly trained or if you are \nnot sure how to do it. \n\n Ilaris 150 mg/ml solution for injection is supplied in a single-use vial for individual use. \n\n Never re-use the leftover solution. \n \n\nFor instructions on how to administer Ilaris injections, please read the section “Instructions for use” at \n\nthe end of this leaflet.

If \nyou experience a new attack, your doctor may consider giving you a new dose of Ilaris but not \n\nearlier than 12 weeks from the previous dose. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Ilaris than you should \n\nIf you accidentally inject more Ilaris than the recommended dose, it is unlikely to be serious, but you \n\nshould inform your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nIf you forget to use Ilaris \n\nIf you have CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF or Still’s disease (AOSD or SJIA) and have forgotten \n\nto inject a dose of Ilaris, inject the next dose as soon as you remember. Then talk to the doctor to \n\ndiscuss when you should inject the next dose. You should then continue with injections at the \n\nrecommended intervals as before. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Ilaris \n\nStopping your treatment with Ilaris may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking Ilaris \n\nunless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Do not use after \nthe expiry date which is stated on the label and carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of \n\nthat month. \n\n Let the vial stand unopened for 10 minutes to bring the contents to room temperature. Do not try \nto heat the vial. Let it warm up on its own. \n\n Always use new, unopened needles and syringes. Do not touch the needles or the top of the vial. \n \n\nGather together the necessary items \n\nIncluded in the pack \n\n- one vial of Ilaris solution for injection (keep refrigerated) \n \n\nNot included in the pack \n\n one 1.0 ml syringe \n\n one needle (such as 18 G or 21 G x 2 inch or similar, as available on the market) to draw up the \nsolution from the vial (“withdrawal needle”). \n\n one 27 G x 0.5 inch (or similar, as available on the market) needle for injecting (“injection \nneedle”) \n\n alcohol swabs \n\n clean, dry cotton swabs \n\n an adhesive plaster \n\n a proper disposal container for used needles, syringe and vial (sharps container) \n \n\n \n\nPreparing the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Take off the protective cap from the Ilaris vial. Do \nnot touch the vial stopper. Clean the rubber stopper \n\nof the vial with an alcohol swab. \n\n \n\nOpen the wrappers containing the syringe and the \n\nwithdrawal needle. \n\n- Put the withdrawal needle on the syringe. \n- Take off the cap from the withdrawal needle. \n- Push the withdrawal needle into the vial of \n\nIlaris solution through the centre of the rubber \n\nstopper. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n2. Tip the vial to ensure that the required amount of \nsolution can be drawn into the syringe. \n\nNOTE: The required amount depends on the dose \n\nto be administered. Your healthcare provider will \n\ninstruct you on the right amount for you. \n\n3. Slowly pull the syringe plunger up to the correct \nmark (amount to be given as per healthcare \n\nprovider’s instructions), filling the syringe with \n\nIlaris solution. If there are air bubbles in the \n\nsyringe, remove bubbles as instructed by your \n\nhealthcare provider. Ensure that the correct amount \n\nof solution is in the syringe. \n\n4. Remove the syringe and withdrawal needle from \nthe vial. (There may be solution remaining in the \n\nvial.) Recap the withdrawal needle as instructed by \n\nyour healthcare provider or pharmacist. Remove \n\nthe withdrawal needle from the syringe and place it \n\nin the sharps container. \n\n5. Open the wrapper containing the injection needle \nand attach the needle to the syringe. Immediately \n\nproceed to administering the injection. \n\n \n\n \n\nGiving the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n6. Choose an injection site on the upper thigh, \nabdomen, upper arm or buttocks. Do not use an \n\narea that has a rash or broken skin, or is bruised or \n\nlumpy. Do not inject into scar tissue as this may \n\nmean you do not get all of your medicine. Avoid \n\ninjecting into a vein. \n\n7. Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. \nAllow the area to dry. Uncap the injection needle. \n\n8. Gently pinch the skin up at the injection site. Hold \nthe syringe at a 90-degree angle and in a single, \n\nsmooth motion, push the needle straight down \n\ncompletely into the skin. \n\n \n\n9. Keep the needle all the way in the skin while \nslowly pushing the syringe plunger down until the \n\nbarrel is empty. Release the pinched skin and pull \n\nthe needle straight out. Dispose of the needle and \n\nsyringe in the sharps container without recapping \n\nor removing the needle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\nAfter the injection \n\n \n\n \n\n10. Do not rub the injection area. If bleeding occurs, \napply a clean, dry cotton swab over the area, and \n\npress gently for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bleeding \n\nstops. Then apply an adhesive plaster. \n\n \n\n \n\n11. Safely dispose of needles and syringe in the sharps \ncontainer or as directed by your healthcare provider \n\nor pharmacist. Never re-use syringes or needles. \n\n12. Properly dispose of vials containing remaining \nIlaris solution (if any) as directed by your \n\nhealthcare provider or pharmacist.
