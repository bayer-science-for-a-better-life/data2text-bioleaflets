NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGranpidam 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 20 mg of sildenafil (as citrate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nEach tablet also contains 0.2 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite to off white, round shaped, approximately 6.6 mm in diameter, biconvex, film-coated tablets, \ndebossed with ‘20’ on one side and plain on other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults \nTreatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II \nand III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension \nand pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nTreatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. \nEfficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown \nin primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart \ndisease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension. In case of clinical deterioration in spite of Granpidam treatment, \nalternative therapies should be considered. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose is 20 mg three times a day (TID). Physicians should advise patients who \nforget to take Granpidam to take a dose as soon as possible and then continue with the normal dose. \nPatients should not take a double dose to compensate for the missed dose. \n \nPaediatric population (1 year to 17 years)  \nFor paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old, the recommended dose in patients ≤20 kg is 10 mg \nthree times a day and for patients >20 kg is 20 mg three times a day. Higher than recommended doses \nshould not be used in paediatric patients with PAH (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). The 20 mg tablet \nshould not be used in cases where 10 mg TID should be administered in younger patients. Other \npharmaceutical forms are available for administration to patients ≤20 kg and other younger patients \nwho are not able to swallow tablets. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients using other medicinal products \nIn general, any dose adjustment should be administered only after a careful benefit-risk assessment. A \ndownward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered when sildenafil is \nco-administered to patients already receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin or saquinavir. A \ndownward dose adjustment to 20 mg once daily is recommended in case of co-administration with \nmore potent CYP3A4 inhibitors clarithromycin, telithromycin and nefazodone. For the use of \nsildenafil with the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, see section 4.3. Dose adjustments for sildenafil \nmay be required when co-administered with CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥65 years) \nDose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. Clinical efficacy as measured by 6-minute walk \ndistance could be less in elderly patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nInitial dose adjustments are not required in patients with renal impairment, including severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily \nshould be considered after a careful benefit-risk assessment only if therapy is not well-tolerated. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInitial dose adjustments are not required in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and \nB). A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered after a careful \nbenefit-risk assessment only if therapy is not well-tolerated. \n \nGranpidam is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of sildenafil in children below 1 year of age has not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nLimited data suggest that the abrupt discontinuation of sildenafil is not associated with rebound \nworsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension. However to avoid the possible occurrence of sudden \nclinical deterioration during withdrawal, a gradual dose reduction should be considered. Intensified \nmonitoring is recommended during the discontinuation period. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGranpidam is for oral use only. Tablets should be taken approximately 6 to 8 hours apart with or \nwithout food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) or nitrates in any form due to the \nhypotensive effects of nitrates (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, \nsuch as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section \n4.5). \n \nCombination with the most potent of the CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nritonavir) (see section 4.5).  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nPatients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic \nneuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with previous PDE5 \ninhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). \n \nThe safety of sildenafil has not been studied in the following sub-groups of patients and its use is \ntherefore contraindicated: \nSevere hepatic impairment, \nRecent history of stroke or myocardial infarction, \nSevere hypotension (blood pressure <90/50 mmHg) at initiation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe efficacy of sildenafil has not been established in patients with severe pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (functional class IV). If the clinical situation deteriorates, therapies that are \nrecommended at the severe stage of the disease (e.g. epoprostenol) should be considered (see \nsection 4.2). The benefit-risk balance of sildenafil has not been established in patients assessed to be at \nWHO functional class I pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n \nStudies with sildenafil have been performed in forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension related to \nprimary (idiopathic), connective tissue disease associated or congenital heart disease associated forms \nof PAH (see section 5.1). The use of sildenafil in other forms of PAH is not recommended. \n \nIn the long term paediatric extension study, an increase in deaths was observed in patients \nadministered doses higher than the recommended dose. Therefore, doses higher than the recommended \ndoses should not be used in paediatric patients with PAH (see also sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nRetinitis pigmentosa \nThe safety of sildenafil has not been studied in patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal \ndisorders such as retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal \nphosphodiesterases) and therefore its use is not recommended. \n \nVasodilatory action \nWhen prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with certain \nunderlying conditions could be adversely affected by sildenafil’s mild to moderate vasodilatory \neffects, for example patients with hypotension, patients with fluid depletion, severe left ventricular \noutflow obstruction or autonomic dysfunction (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular risk factors \nIn post-marketing experience with sildenafil for male erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular \nevents, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, \ncerebrovascular haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack, hypertension and hypotension have been \nreported in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had \npre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Many events were reported to occur during or shortly after \nsexual intercourse and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual \nactivity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these factors or to \nother factors.  \n \nPriapism \nSildenafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as \nangulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie’s disease), or in patients who have conditions which may \npredispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). \n \nProlonged erections and priapism have been reported with sildenafil in post-marketing experience. In \nthe event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical \nassistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency \ncould result (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nVaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell anaemia \nSildenafil should not be used in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell \nanaemia. In a clinical study events of vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalisation were reported \nmore commonly by patients receiving sildenafil than those receiving placebo leading to the premature \ntermination of this study. \n \nVisual events \nCases of visual defects have been reported spontaneously in connection with the intake of sildenafil \nand other PDE5 inhibitors. Cases of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, a rare condition, \nhave been reported spontaneously and in an observational study in connection with the intake of \nsildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.8). In the event of any sudden visual defect, the \ntreatment should be stopped immediately and alternative treatment should be considered \n(see section 4.3). \n \nAlpha-blockers \nCaution is advised when sildenafil is administered to patients taking an alpha-blocker as the \nco-administration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in susceptible individuals (see section 4.5). In \norder to minimise the potential for developing postural hypotension, patients should be \nhaemodynamically stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment. Physicians \nshould advise patients what to do in the event of postural hypotensive symptoms. \n \nBleeding disorders \nStudies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium \nnitroprusside in vitro. There is no safety information on the administration of sildenafil to patients with \nbleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. Therefore sildenafil should be administered to these \npatients only after careful benefit-risk assessment. \n \nVitamin K antagonists \nIn pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, there may be a potential for increased risk of bleeding \nwhen sildenafil is initiated in patients already using a Vitamin K antagonist, particularly in patients \nwith pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease. \n \nVeno-occlusive disease \nNo data are available with sildenafil in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with \npulmonary veno-occlusive disease. However, cases of life threatening pulmonary oedema have been \nreported with vasodilators (mainly prostacyclin) when used in those patients. Consequently, should \nsigns of pulmonary oedema occur when sildenafil is administered in patients with pulmonary \nhypertension, the possibility of associated veno-occlusive disease should be considered. \n \nGalactose intolerance \nLactose monohydrate is present in the tablet film coat. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicine. \n \nUse of sildenafil with bosentan \nThe efficacy of sildenafil in patients already on bosentan therapy has not been conclusively \ndemonstrated (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nConcomitant use with other PDE5 inhibitors \nThe safety and efficacy of sildenafil when co-administered with other PDE5 inhibitor products, \nincluding the combined use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction, has not been studied in PAH patients \nand such concomitant use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on sildenafil \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIn vitro studies \nSildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major \nroute) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil \nclearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance. For dose \nrecommendations, see sections 4.2 and 4.3. \n \nIn vivo studies \nCo-administration of oral sildenafil and intravenous epoprostenol has been evaluated (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of sildenafil co-administered with other treatments for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (e.g. ambrisentan, iloprost) has not been studied in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, \ncaution is recommended in case of co-administration. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of sildenafil when co-administered with other PDE5 inhibitors has not been \nstudied in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.4).  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trial data indicated a \nreduction in sildenafil clearance and/or an increase of oral bioavailability when co-administered with \nCYP3A4 substrates and the combination of CYP3A4 substrates and beta-blockers. These were the \nonly factors with a statistically significant impact on sildenafil pharmacokinetics in patients with \npulmonary arterial hypertension. The exposure to sildenafil in patients on CYP3A4 substrates and \nCYP3A4 substrates plus beta-blockers was 43% and 66% higher, respectively, compared to patients \nnot receiving these classes of medicines. Sildenafil exposure was 5-fold higher at a dose of 80 mg \nthree times a day compared to the exposure at a dose of 20 mg three times a day. This concentration \nrange covers the increase in sildenafil exposure observed in specifically designed drug interaction \nstudies with CYP3A4 inhibitors (except with the most potent of the CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir).  \n \nCYP3A4 inducers seemed to have a substantial impact on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in \npulmonary arterial hypertension patients, which was confirmed in the in vivo interaction study with \nCYP3A4 inducer bosentan.  \n \nCo-administration of bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) \n125 mg twice daily with sildenafil 80 mg three times a day (at steady state) concomitantly \nadministered during 6 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC. A \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of sildenafil data from adult PAH patients in clinical trials \nincluding a 12 week study to assess the efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil 20 mg three times a day \nwhen added to a stable dose of bosentan (62.5 mg-125 mg twice a day) indicated a decrease in \nsildenafil exposure with bosentan co-administration, similar to that observed in healthy volunteers \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nEfficacy of sildenafil should be closely monitored in patients using concomitant potent \nCYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St John’s wort and rifampicine. \n \nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at \nsteady state (500 mg twice daily) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) \nincrease in sildenafil Cmax and a 1,000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours, the \nplasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/ml, compared to approximately 5 ng/ml \nwhen sildenafil was administered alone. This is consistent with ritonavir’s marked effects on a broad \nrange of P450 substrates. Based on these pharmacokinetic results co-administration of sildenafil with \nritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3).  \n \nCo-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state \n(1200 mg three times a day) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in \n\n\n\n7 \n\nsildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir \npharmacokinetics. For dose recommendations, see section 4.2. \n \nWhen a single 100 mg dose of sildenafil was administered with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, at steady state (500 mg twice daily for 5 days), there was a 182% increase in sildenafil \nsystemic exposure (AUC). For dose recommendations, see section 4.2. In healthy male volunteers, \nthere was no evidence of an effect of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days) on the AUC, Cmax, Tmax, \nelimination rate constant, or subsequent half-life of sildenafil or its principal circulating metabolite. \nNo dose adjustment is required. Cimetidine (800 mg), a cytochrome P450 inhibitor and a non-specific \nCYP3A4 inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when co-administered \nwith sildenafil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment is required. \n \nThe most potent of the CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole and itraconazole would be expected \nto have effects similar to ritonavir (see section 4.3). CYP3A4 inhibitors like clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin and nefazodone are expected to have an effect in between that of ritonavir and \nCYP3A4 inhibitors like saquinavir or erythromycin, a seven-fold increase in exposure is assumed. \nTherefore dose adjustments are recommended when using CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.2). \n \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients suggested that \nco-administration of beta-blockers in combination with CYP3A4 substrates might result in an \nadditional increase in sildenafil exposure compared with administration of CYP3A4 substrates alone. \n \nGrapefruit juice is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 gut wall metabolism and may give rise to modest \nincreases in plasma levels of sildenafil. No dose adjustment is required but the concomitant use of \nsildenafil and grapefruit juice is not recommended. \n \nSingle doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminium hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability \nof sildenafil. \n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives (ethinyloestradiol 30 µg and levonorgestrel 150 µg) did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil. \n \nNicorandil is a hybrid of potassium channel activator and nitrate. Due to the nitrate component it has \nthe potential to have serious interaction with sildenafil (see section 4.3). \n \nEffects of sildenafil on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro studies \nSildenafil is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 \n(IC50 >150 µM). \n \nThere are no data on the interaction of sildenafil and non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as \ntheophylline or dipyridamole. \n \nIn vivo studies \nNo significant interactions were shown when sildenafil (50 mg) was co-administered with tolbutamide \n(250 mg) or warfarin (40 mg), both of which are metabolised by CYP2C9. \n \nSildenafil had no significant effect on atorvastatin exposure (AUC increased 11%), suggesting that \nsildenafil does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP3A4. \n \nNo interactions were observed between sildenafil (100 mg single dose) and acenocoumarol. \n \nSildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid \n(150 mg).  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of alcohol in healthy volunteers with \nmean maximum blood alcohol levels of 80 mg/dl. \n \nIn a study of healthy volunteers sildenafil at steady state (80 mg three times a day) resulted in a 50% \nincrease in bosentan AUC (125 mg twice daily). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from a \nstudy of adult PAH patients on background bosentan therapy (62.5 mg-125 mg twice a day) indicated \nan increase (20% (95% CI: 9.8-30.8)) of bosentan AUC with co-administration of steady-state \nsildenafil (20 mg three times a day) of a smaller magnitude than seen in healthy volunteers when \nco-administered with 80 mg sildenafil three times a day (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn a specific interaction study, where sildenafil (100 mg) was co-administered with amlodipine in \nhypertensive patients, there was an additional reduction on supine systolic blood pressure of 8 mmHg. \nThe corresponding additional reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure was 7 mmHg. These \nadditional blood pressure reductions were of a similar magnitude to those seen when sildenafil was \nadministered alone to healthy volunteers. \n \nIn three specific drug-drug interaction studies, the alpha-blocker doxazosin (4 mg and 8 mg) and \nsildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) were administered simultaneously to patients with benign \nprostatic hyperplasia (BPH) stabilized on doxazosin therapy. In these study populations, mean \nadditional reductions of supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7/7 mmHg, 9/5 mmHg, and \n8/4 mmHg, respectively, and mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/6 mmHg, \n11/4 mmHg, and 4/5 mmHg, respectively were observed. When sildenafil and doxazosin were \nadministered simultaneously to patients stabilized on doxazosin therapy, there were infrequent reports \nof patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and \nlightheadedness, but not syncope. Concomitant administration of sildenafil to patients taking \nalpha-blocker therapy may lead to symptomatic hypotension in susceptible individuals (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSildenafil (100 mg single dose) did not affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of the HIV protease \ninhibitor saquinavir, which is a CYP3A4 substrate/inhibitor. \n \nConsistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was \nshown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its co-administration with nitric oxide \ndonors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nRiociguat: Preclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 \ninhibitors were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the \nhypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the \ncombination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including \nsildenafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSildenafil had no clinically significant impact on the plasma levels of oral contraceptives \n(ethinyloestradiol 30 µg and levonorgestrel 150 µg). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females \nDue to lack of data on effects of sildenafil in pregnant women, Granpidam is not recommended for \nwomen of childbearing potential unless also using appropriate contraceptive measures.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of sildenafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy and embryonal/foetal development. Studies in \nanimals have shown toxicity with respect to postnatal development (see section 5.3).  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nDue to lack of data, Granpidam should not be used in pregnant women unless strictly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in lactating women. Data from one lactating woman \nindicate that sildenafil and its active metabolite N-desmethylsildenafil are excreted into breast milk at \nvery low levels. No clinical data are available regarding adverse events in breast-fed infants, but \namounts ingested would not be expected to cause any adverse effects. Prescribers should carefully \nassess the mother’s clinical need for sildenafil and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed child. \nFertility \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of fertility (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSildenafil has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nAs dizziness and altered vision were reported in clinical trials with sildenafil, patients should be aware \nof how they might be affected by Granpidam, before driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn the pivotal placebo-controlled study of sildenafil in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a total of \n207 patients were randomized to and treated with 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg TID doses of sildenafil and \n70 patients were randomized to placebo. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The overall \nfrequency of discontinuation in sildenafil treated patients at doses of 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID \nwas 2.9%, 3.0% and 8.5% respectively, compared to 2.9% with placebo. Of the 277 subjects treated in \nthe pivotal study, 259 entered a long-term extension study. Doses up to 80 mg three times a day \n(4 times the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day) were administered and after 3 years 87% \nof 183 patients on study treatment were receiving sildenafil 80 mg TID. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study of sildenafil as an adjunct to intravenous epoprostenol in pulmonary \narterial hypertension, a total of 134 patients were treated with sildenafil (in a fixed titration starting \nfrom 20 mg, to 40 mg and then 80 mg, three times a day, as tolerated) and epoprostenol, and \n131 patients were treated with placebo and epoprostenol. The duration of treatment was 16 weeks. The \noverall frequency of discontinuations in sildenafil/epoprostenol treated patients due to adverse events \nwas 5.2% compared to 10.7% in the placebo/epoprostenol treated patients. Newly reported adverse \nreactions, which occurred more frequently in the sildenafil/ epoprostenol group, were ocular \nhyperaemia, vision blurred, nasal congestion, night sweats, back pain and dry mouth. The known \nadverse reactions headache, flushing, pain in extremity and oedema were noted in a higher frequency \nin sildenafil/epoprostenol treated patients compared to placebo/epoprostenol treated patients. Of the \nsubjects who completed the initial study, 242 entered a long-term extension study. Doses up to 80 mg \nTID were administered and after 3 years 68% of 133 patients on study treatment were receiving \nsildenafil 80 mg TID. \n \nIn the two placebo-controlled studies adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity. The \nmost commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred (greater or equal to 10%) on sildenafil \ncompared to placebo were headache, flushing, dyspepsia, diarrhoea and pain in extremity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions which occurred in >1% of sildenafil-treated patients and were more frequent (>1% \ndifference) on sildenafil in the pivotal study or in the sildenafil combined data set of both the \nplacebo-controlled studies in pulmonary arterial hypertension, at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg TID are \nlisted in the table below by class and frequency grouping (very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nReports from post-marketing experience are included in italics. \n \nMedDRA system organ class (V.14.0)  Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations  \nCommon cellulitis, influenza, bronchitis, sinusitis, rhinitis, \n\ngastroenteritis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \nCommon anaemia \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nCommon fluid retention \nPsychiatric disorders  \nCommon insomnia, anxiety \nNervous system disorders  \nVery common headache \nCommon migraine, tremor, paraesthesia, burning \n\nsensation, hypoaesthesia \nEye disorders  \nCommon retinal haemorrhage, visual impairment, vision \n\nblurred, photophobia, chromatopsia, cyanopsia, \neye irritation, ocular hyperaemia \n\nUncommon visual acuity reduced, diplopia, abnormal \nsensation in eye \n\nNot known Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic \nneuropathy (NAION)*, Retinal vascular \nocclusion*, Visual field defect* \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders  \nCommon vertigo \nNot known sudden hearing loss \nVascular disorders  \nVery common flushing \nNot known hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCommon epistaxis, cough, nasal congestion \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nVery common diarrhoea, dyspepsia \nCommon gastritis, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, \n\nhaemorrhoids, abdominal distension, dry mouth \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \nCommon alopecia, erythema, night sweats \nNot known rash \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nVery common pain in extremity \nCommon myalgia, back pain \nRenal and urinary disorders  \nUncommon haematuria \nReproductive system and breast disorders  \nUncommon penile haemorrhage, haematospermia, \n\ngynaecomastia \nNot known priapism, erection increased \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n \n\nCommon pyrexia \n*These adverse events/reactions have been reported in patients taking sildenafil for the treatment of \nmale erectile dysfunction (MED). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n \nPaediatric population \nIn the placebo-controlled study of sildenafil in patients 1 to 17 years of age with pulmonary arterial \nhypertension, a total of 174 patients were treated three times a day with either low (10 mg in patients \n>20 kg; no patients ≤20 kg received the low dose), medium (10 mg in patients ≥8-20 kg; 20 mg in \npatients ≥20-45 kg; 40 mg in patients >45 kg) or high dose (20 mg in patients ≥8-20 kg; 40 mg in \npatients ≥20-45 kg; 80 mg in patients >45 kg) regimens of sildenafil and 60 were treated with placebo. \n \nThe adverse reactions profile seen in this paediatric study was generally consistent with that in adults \n(see table above). The most common adverse reactions that occurred (with a frequency ≥1%) in \nsildenafil patients (combined doses) and with a frequency >1% over placebo patients were pyrexia, \nupper respiratory tract infection (each 11.5%), vomiting (10.9%), erection increased (including \nspontaneous penile erections in male subjects) (9.0%), nausea, bronchitis (each 4.6%), pharyngitis \n(4.0%), rhinorrhoea (3.4%), and pneumonia, rhinitis (each 2.9%). \n \nOf the 234 paediatric subjects treated in the short-term, placebo-controlled study, 220 subjects entered \nthe long-term extension study. Subjects on active sildenafil therapy continued on the same treatment \nregimen, while those in the placebo group in the short-term study were randomly reassigned to \nsildenafil treatment. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported across the duration of the short-term and long-term \nstudies were generally similar to those observed in the short-term study. Adverse reactions reported in \n>10% of 229 subjects treated with sildenafil (combined dose group, including 9 patients that did not \ncontinue into the long-term study) were upper respiratory infection (31%), headache (26%), vomiting \n(22%), bronchitis (20%), pharyngitis (18%), pyrexia (17%), diarrhoea (15%), and influenza, epistaxis \n(12% each). Most of these adverse reactions were considered mild to moderate in severity.  \n \nSerious adverse events were reported in 94 (41%) of the 229 subjects receiving sildenafil. Of the \n94 subjects reporting a serious adverse event, 14/55 (25.5%) subjects were in the low dose group, \n35/74 (47.3%) in the medium dose group, and 45/100 (45%) in the high dose group. The most \ncommon serious adverse events that occurred with a frequency ≥1% in sildenafil patients (combined \ndoses) were pneumonia (7.4%), cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (each 5.2%), upper \nrespiratory tract infection (3.1%), right ventricular failure, gastroenteritis (each 2.6%), syncope, \nbronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary arterial hypertension (each 2.2%), chest pain, dental caries \n(each 1.7%), and cardiogenic shock, gastroenteritis viral, urinary tract infection (each 1.3%). \n \nThe following serious adverse events were considered to be treatment related, enterocolitis, \nconvulsion, hypersensitivity, stridor, hypoxia, neurosensory deafness and ventricular arrhythmia. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn single dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at \nlower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased. At single doses of 200 mg the \nincidence of adverse reactions (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, and altered \nvision) was increased. \nIn cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is \nnot expected to accelerate clearance as sildenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not eliminated \nin the urine. \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC code: G04BE03 \n \nMechanism of action \nSildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific \nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme that is responsible for degradation of cGMP. Apart from \nthe presence of this enzyme in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the \npulmonary vasculature. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth \nmuscle cells resulting in relaxation. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension this can lead to \nvasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic \ncirculation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nStudies in vitro have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 \nthan on other known phosphodiesterases. There is a 10-fold selectivity over PDE6 which is involved \nin the phototransduction pathway in the retina. There is an 80-fold selectivity over PDE1, and over \n700-fold over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. In particular, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-fold \nselectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control \nof cardiac contractility. \n \nSildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of \ncases, do not translate into clinical effects. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients \nwith systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was \na decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mm Hg respectively. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day \nto patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were \nobserved (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg). At the recommended dose of \n20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen.  \nSingle oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant \neffects on ECG. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial \nhypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported. \n \nIn a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with \nsevere coronary artery disease (CAD) (>70% stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 6% respectively compared to baseline. \nMean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9%. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac \noutput, and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries. \n \nMild and transient differences in colour discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects \nusing the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident \nafter 2 hours post-dose. The postulated mechanism for this change in colour discrimination is related \nto inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina. Sildenafil has \nno effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients \nwith documented early age-related macular degeneration (n=9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) \ndemonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (visual acuity, Amsler grid, colour \ndiscrimination simulated traffic light, Humphrey perimeter and photostress). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy in adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 278 patients with primary \npulmonary hypertension, PAH associated with connective tissue disease, and PAH following surgical \nrepair of congenital heart lesions. Patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups: placebo, \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsildenafil 20 mg, sildenafil 40 mg or sildenafil 80 mg, three times a day. Of the 278 patients \nrandomised, 277 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug. The study population consisted of \n68 (25%) men and 209 (75%) women with a mean age of 49 years (range: 18-81 years) and baseline \n6-minute walk test distance between 100 and 450 metres inclusive (mean: 344 metres). 175 patients \n(63%) included were diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension, 84 (30%) were diagnosed with \nPAH associated with connective tissue disease and 18 (7%) of the patients were diagnosed with PAH \nfollowing surgical repair of congenital heart lesions. Most patients were WHO Functional Class II \n(107/277, 39%) or III (160/277, 58%) with a mean baseline 6 minute walking distance of 378 meters \nand 326 meters respectively; fewer patients were Class I (1/277, 0.4%) or IV (9/277, 3%) at baseline. \nPatients with left ventricular ejection fraction <45% or left ventricular shortening fraction <0.2 were \nnot studied. \n \nSildenafil (or placebo) was added to patients’ background therapy which could have included a \ncombination of anticoagulation, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, diuretics or oxygen. The use of \nprostacyclin, prostacyclin analogues and endothelin receptor antagonists was not permitted as add-on \ntherapy, and neither was arginine supplementation. Patients who previously failed bosentan therapy \nwere excluded from the study. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 12 in 6-minute walk distance \n(6MWD). A statistically significant increase in 6MWD was observed in all 3 sildenafil dose groups \ncompared to those on placebo. Placebo corrected increases in 6MWD were 45 metres (p <0.0001), \n46 metres (p <0.0001) and 50 metres (p <0.0001) for sildenafil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID \nrespectively. There was no significant difference in effect between sildenafil doses. For patients with a \nbaseline 6MWD <325 m improved efficacy was observed with higher doses (placebo-corrected \nimprovements of 58 metres, 65 metres and 87 metres for 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg doses TID, \nrespectively).  \n \nWhen analysed by WHO functional class, a statistically significant increase in 6MWD was observed \nin the 20 mg dose group. For class II and class III, placebo corrected increases of 49 metres \n(p = 0.0007) and 45 metres (p = 0.0031) were observed respectively. \n \nThe improvement in 6MWD was apparent after 4 weeks of treatment and this effect was maintained at \nweeks 8 and 12. Results were generally consistent in subgroups according to aetiology (primary and \nconnective tissue disease-associated PAH), WHO functional class, gender, race, location, mean PAP \nand PVRI. \n \nPatients on all sildenafil doses achieved a statistically significant reduction in mean pulmonary arterial \npressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared to those on placebo. \nPlacebo-corrected treatment effects with mPAP were -2.7 mmHg (p = 0.04), -3.0 mm Hg (p = 0.01) \nand -5.1 mm Hg (p <0.0001) for sildenafil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID respectively. \nPlacebo-corrected treatment effects with PVR were -178 dyne.sec/cm5 (p=0.0051), -195 dyne.sec/cm5 \n(p=0.0017) and -320 dyne.sec/cm5 (p<0.0001) for sildenafil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID, \nrespectively. The percent reduction at 12 weeks for sildenafil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID in PVR \n(11.2%, 12.9%, 23.3%) was proportionally greater than the reduction in systemic vascular resistance \n(SVR) (7.2%, 5.9%, 14.4%). The effect of sildenafil on mortality is unknown. \n \nA greater percentage of patients on each of the sildenafil doses (i.e. 28%, 36% and 42% of subjects \nwho received sildenafil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID doses, respectively) showed an improvement by \nat least one WHO functional class at week 12 compared to placebo (7%). The respective odds ratios \nwere 2.92 (p=0.0087), 4.32 (p=0.0004) and 5.75 (p<0.0001). \n \nLong-term survival data in naive population \nPatients enrolled into the pivotal study were eligible to enter a long term open label extension study. \nAt 3 years 87% of the patients were receiving a dose of 80 mg TID. A total of 207 patients were \ntreated with sildenafil in the pivotal study, and their long term survival status was assessed for a \nminimum of 3 years. In this population, Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1, 2 and 3 year survival were 96%, \n91% and 82%, respectively. Survival in patients of WHO functional class II at baseline at 1, 2 and \n\n\n\n14 \n\n3 years was 99%, 91%, and 84% respectively, and for patients of WHO functional class III at baseline \nwas 94%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. \n \nEfficacy in adult patients with PAH (when used in combination with epoprostenol) \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study was conducted in 267 patients with PAH who \nwere stabilised on intravenous epoprostenol. The PAH patients included those with Primary \nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension (212/267, 79%) and PAH associated with connective tissue disease \n(55/267, 21%). Most patients were WHO Functional Class II (68/267, 26%) or III (175/267, 66%); \nfewer patients were Class I (3/267, 1%) or IV (16/267, 6%) at baseline; for a few patients (5/267, 2%), \nthe WHO Functional Class was unknown. Patients were randomised to placebo or sildenafil (in a fixed \ntitration starting from 20 mg, to 40 mg and then 80 mg, three times a day as tolerated) when used in \ncombination with intravenous epoprostenol. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 16 in 6-minute walk distance. \nThere was a statistically significant benefit of sildenafil compared to placebo in 6-minute walk \ndistance. A mean placebo corrected increase in walk distance of 26 metres was observed in favour of \nsildenafil (95% CI: 10.8, 41.2) (p = 0.0009). For patients with a baseline walking distance \n≥325 metres, the treatment effect was 38.4 metres in favour of sildenafil; for patients with a baseline \nwalking distance <325 metres, the treatment effect was 2.3 metres in favour of placebo. For patients \nwith primary PAH, the treatment effect was 31.1 metres compared to 7.7 metres for patients with PAH \nassociated with connective tissue disease. The difference in results between these randomisation \nsubgroups may have arisen by chance in view of their limited sample size. \n \nPatients on sildenafil achieved a statistically significant reduction in mean Pulmonary Arterial \nPressure (mPAP) compared to those on placebo. A mean placebo-corrected treatment effect of \n-3.9 mmHg was observed in favour of sildenafil (95% CI: -5.7, -2.1) (p = 0.00003). Time to clinical \nworsening was a secondary endpoint as defined as the time from randomisation to the first occurrence \nof a clinical worsening event (death, lung transplantation, initiation of bosentan therapy, or clinical \ndeterioration requiring a change in epoprostenol therapy). Treatment with sildenafil significantly \ndelayed the time to clinical worsening of PAH compared to placebo (p = 0.0074). 23 subjects \nexperienced clinical worsening events in the placebo group (17.6%) compared with 8 subjects in the \nsildenafil group (6.0%). \n \nLong-term Survival Data in the background epoprostenol study \nPatients enrolled into the epoprostenol add-on therapy study were eligible to enter a long term open \nlabel extension study. At 3 years 68% of the patients were receiving a dose of 80 mg TID. A total of \n134 patients were treated with sildenafil in the initial study, and their long term survival status was \nassessed for a minimum of 3 years. In this population, Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1, 2 and 3 year \nsurvival were 92%, 81% and 74%, respectively. \n \nEfficacy and safety in adult patients with PAH (when used in combination with bosentan) \nA randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study was conducted in 103 clinically stable subjects \nwith PAH (WHO FC II and III) who were on bosentan therapy for a minimum of three months. The \nPAH patients included those with primary PAH, and PAH associated with connective tissue disease. \nPatients were randomized to placebo or sildenafil (20 mg three times a day) in combination with \nbosentan (62.5-125 mg twice a day). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at \nWeek 12 in 6MWD. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean change from \nbaseline on 6MWD observed between sildenafil (20 mg three times a day) and placebo (13.62 m \n(95% CI: -3.89 to 31.12) and 14.08 m (95% CI: -1.78 to 29.95), respectively).  \n \nDifferences in 6MWD were observed between patients with primary PAH and PAH associated with \nconnective tissue disease. For subjects with primary PAH (67 subjects), mean changes from baseline \nwere 26.39 m (95% CI: 10.70 to 42.08) and 11.84 m (95% CI: -8.83 to 32.52) for the sildenafil and \nplacebo groups, respectively. However, for subjects with PAH associated with connective tissue \ndisease (36 subjects) mean changes from baseline were -18.32 m (95% CI: -65.66 to 29.02) and \n17.50 m (95% CI: -9.41 to 44.41) for the sildenafil and placebo groups, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nOverall, the adverse events were generally similar between the two treatment groups (sildenafil plus \nbosentan vs. bosentan alone), and consistent with the known safety profile of sildenafil when used as \nmonotherapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nA total of 234 subjects aged 1 to 17 years were treated in a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, \nplacebo controlled parallel group, dose ranging study. Subjects (38% male and 62% female) had a \nbody weight ≥8 kg, and had primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) [33%], or PAH secondary to \ncongenital heart disease [systemic-to-pulmonary shunt 37%, surgical repair 30%]. In this trial, 63 of \n234 (27%) patients were <7 years old (sildenafil low dose = 2; medium dose = 17; high dose = 28; \nplacebo = 16) and 171 of 234 (73%) patients were 7 years or older (sildenafil low dose = 40; medium \ndose = 38; and high dose = 49; placebo = 44). Most subjects were WHO Functional Class I \n(75/234, 32%) or II (120/234, 51%) at baseline; fewer patients were Class III (35/234, 15%) or IV \n(1/234, 0.4%); for a few patients (3/234, 1.3%), the WHO Functional Class was unknown. \n \nPatients were naïve for specific PAH therapy and the use of prostacyclin, prostacyclin analogues and \nendothelin receptor antagonists was not permitted in the study, and neither was arginine \nsupplementation, nitrates, alpha-blockers and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. \n \nThe primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of 16 weeks of chronic treatment with \noral sildenafil in paediatric subjects to improve exercise capacity as measured by the Cardiopulmonary \nExercise Test (CPET) in subjects who were developmentally able to perform the test, n = 115). \nSecondary endpoints included haemodynamic monitoring, symptom assessment, WHO functional \nclass, change in background treatment, and quality of life measurements.  \n \nSubjects were allocated to one of three sildenafil treatment groups, low (10 mg), medium (10-40 mg) \nor high dose (20-80 mg) regimens of sildenafil given three times a day, or placebo. Actual doses \nadministered within a group were dependent on body weight (see Section 4.8). The proportion of \nsubjects receiving supportive medicinal products at baseline (anticoagulants, digoxin, calcium channel \nblockers, diuretics and/or oxygen) was similar in the combined sildenafil treatment group (47.7%) and \nthe placebo treatment group (41.7%). \n \nThe primary endpoint was the placebo-corrected percentage change in peak VO2 from baseline to \nweek 16 assessed by CPET testing in the combined dose groups (Table 2). A total of 106 out of \n234 (45%) subjects were evaluable for CPET, which comprised those children ≥7 years old and \ndevelopmentally able to perform the test. Children <7 years (sildenafil combined dose = 47; \nplacebo = 16) were evaluable only for the secondary endpoints. Mean baseline peak volume of oxygen \nconsumed (VO2) values were comparable across the sildenafil treatment groups \n(17.37 to 18.03 ml/kg/min), and slightly higher for the placebo treatment group (20.02 ml/kg/min). \nThe results of the main analysis (combined dose groups versus placebo) were not statistically \nsignificant (p = 0.056) (see Table 2). The estimated difference between the medium sildenafil dose and \nplacebo was 11.33% (95% CI: 1.72 to 20.94) (see Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Placebo Corrected % Change from Baseline in Peak VO2 by Active Treatment Group \n \nTreatment group Estimated difference 95% confidence interval \nLow dose \n(n=24) \n\n3.81 -6.11, 13.73 \n\nMedium dose \n(n=26) \n\n11.33 1.72, 20.94 \n\nHigh dose \n(n=27) \n\n7.98 -1.64, 17.60 \n\nCombined dose groups \n(n=77) \n\n7.71 \n(p = 0.056) \n\n-0.19, 15.60 \n\nn=29 for placebo group \nEstimates based on ANCOVA with adjustments for the covariates baseline peak VO2, etiology and \nweight group \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nDose related improvements were observed with pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and mean \npulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). The sildenafil medium and high dose groups both showed PVRI \nreductions compared to placebo, of 18% (95% CI: 2% to 32%) and 27% (95% CI: 14% to 39%), \nrespectively; whilst the low dose group showed no significant difference from placebo (difference of \n2%). The sildenafil medium and high dose groups displayed mPAP changes from baseline compared \nto placebo, of -3.5 mmHg (95% CI: -8.9, 1.9) and -7.3 mmHg (95% CI: -12.4, -2.1), respectively; \nwhilst the low dose group showed little difference from placebo (difference of 1.6 mmHg). \nImprovements were observed with cardiac index with all three sildenafil groups over placebo, 10%, \n4% and 15% for the low, medium and high dose groups respectively. \n \nSignificant improvements in functional class were demonstrated only in subjects on sildenafil high \ndose compared to placebo. Odds ratios for the sildenafil low, medium and high dose groups compared \nto placebo were 0.6 (95% CI: 0.18, 2.01), 2.25 (95% CI: 0.75, 6.69) and 4.52 (95% CI: 1.56, 13.10), \nrespectively. \n \nLong term extension data \nOf the 234 paediatric subjects treated in the short-term, placebo-controlled study, 220 subjects entered \nthe long-term extension study. Subjects who had been in the placebo group in the short-term study \nwere randomly reassigned to sildenafil treatment; subjects weighing ≤20 kg entered the medium or \nhigh dose groups (1:1), while subjects weighing >20 kg entered the low, medium or high dose groups \n(1:1:1). Of the total 229 subjects who received sildenafil, there were 55, 74, and 100 subjects in the \nlow, medium and high dose groups, respectively. Across the short-term and long-term studies, the \noverall duration of treatment from start of double-blind for individual subjects ranged from 3 to \n3129 days. By sildenafil treatment group, median duration of sildenafil treatment was 1696 days \n(excluding the 5 subjects who received placebo in double-blind and were not treated in the long-term \nextension study). \n \nKaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 3 years in patients >20 kg in weight at baseline were 94%, 93% \nand 85% in the low, medium and high dose groups, respectively; for patients ≤20 kg in weight at \nbaseline, the survival estimates were 94% and 93% for subjects in the medium and high dose groups \nrespectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nDuring the conduct of the study, there were a total of 42 deaths reported, whether on treatment or \nreported as part of the survival follow-up. 37 deaths occurred prior to a decision taken by the Data \nMonitoring Committee to down titrate subjects to a lower dosage, based on an observed mortality \nimbalance with increasing sildenafil doses. Among these 37 deaths, the number (%) of deaths was \n5/55 (9.1%), 10/74 (13.5%), and 22/100 (22%) in the sildenafil low, medium, and high dose groups, \nrespectively. An additional 5 deaths were reported subsequently. The causes of deaths were related to \nPAH. Higher than recommended doses should not be used in paediatric patients with PAH (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nPeak VO2 was assessed 1 year after the start of the placebo-controlled study. Of those sildenafil treated \nsubjects developmentally able to perform the CPET 59/114 subjects (52%) had not shown any \ndeterioration in Peak VO2 from start of sildenafil. Similarly 191 of 229 subjects (83%) who had \nreceived sildenafil had either maintained or improved their WHO Functional Class at 1 year \nassessment. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nsildenafil in newborns with pulmonary arterial hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nSildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within \n30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. The mean absolute oral \n\n\n\n17 \n\nbioavailability is 41% (range 25-63%). After oral three times a day dosing of sildenafil, AUC and Cmax \nincrease in proportion with dose over the dose range of 20-40 mg. After oral doses of 80 mg three \ntimes a day a more than dose proportional increase in sildenafil plasma levels has been observed. In \npulmonary arterial hypertension patients, the oral bioavailability of sildenafil after 80 mg three times a \nday was on average 43% (90% CI: 27%-60%) higher compared to the lower doses. \n \nWhen sildenafil is taken with food, the rate of absorption is reduced with a mean delay in Tmax of \n60 minutes and a mean reduction in Cmax of 29% however, the extent of absorption was not \nsignificantly affected (AUC decreased by 11%). \n \nDistribution \nThe mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is 105 l, indicating distribution into \nthe tissues. After oral doses of 20 mg three times a day, the mean maximum total plasma concentration \nof sildenafil at steady state is approximately 113 ng/ml. Sildenafil and its major circulating \nN-desmethyl metabolite are approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding is \nindependent of total drug concentrations.  \n \nBiotransformation \nSildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic \nmicrosomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-demethylation of sildenafil. \nThis metabolite has a phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an in vitro potency \nfor PDE5 approximately 50% that of the parent drug. The N-desmethyl metabolite is further \nmetabolised, with a terminal half-life of approximately 4 h. In patients with pulmonary arterial \nhypertension, plasma concentrations of N-desmethyl metabolite are approximately 72% those of \nsildenafil after 20 mg three times a day dosing (translating into a 36% contribution to sildenafil’s \npharmacological effects). The subsequent effect on efficacy is unknown. \n \nElimination \nThe total body clearance of sildenafil is 41 l/h with a resultant terminal phase half-life of 3-5 h. After \neither oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the \nfaeces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine \n(approximately 13% of administered oral dose). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nHealthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in \napproximately 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite \ncompared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years). Due to age-differences in plasma \nprotein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately \n40%. \n \nRenal insufficiency  \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance = 30-80 ml/min), the \npharmacokinetics of sildenafil were not altered after receiving a 50 mg single oral dose. In volunteers \nwith severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, \nresulting in mean increases in AUC and Cmax of 100% and 88% respectively compared to age-matched \nvolunteers with no renal impairment. In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and Cmax values were \nsignificantly increased by 200% and 79% respectively in subjects with severe renal impairment \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. \n \nHepatic insufficiency  \nIn volunteers with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and B) sildenafil clearance \nwas reduced, resulting in increases in AUC (85%) and Cmax (47%) compared to age-matched \nvolunteers with no hepatic impairment. In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and Cmax values \nwere significantly increased by 154% and 87%, respectively in cirrhotic subjects compared to subjects \n\n\n\n18 \n\nwith normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired \nhepatic function have not been studied. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \nIn patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the average steady state concentrations were 20-50% \nhigher over the investigated dose range of 20-80 mg three times a day compared to healthy volunteers. \nThere was a doubling of the Cmin compared to healthy volunteers. Both findings suggest a lower \nclearance and/or a higher oral bioavailability of sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial \nhypertension compared to healthy volunteers. \n \nPaediatric population \nFrom the analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile of sildenafil in patients involved in the paediatric \nclinical trials, body weight was shown to be a good predictor of drug exposure in children. Sildenafil \nplasma concentration half-life values were estimated to range from 4.2 to 4.4 hours for a range of \n10 to 70 kg of body weight and did not show any differences that would appear as clinically relevant. \nCmax after a single 20 mg sildenafil dose administered PO was estimated at 49, 104 and 165 ng/ml for \n70, 20 and 10 kg patients, respectively. Cmax after a single 10 mg sildenafil dose administered PO was \nestimated at 24, 53 and 85 ng/ml for 70, 20 and 10 kg patients, respectively. Tmax was estimated at \napproximately 1 hour and was almost independent from body weight. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nIn pups of rats which were pre- and postnatally treated with 60 mg/kg sildenafil, a decreased litter size, \na lower pup weight on day 1 and a decreased 4-day survival were seen at exposures which were \napproximately fifty times the expected human exposure at 20 mg three times a day. Effects in \nnon-clinical studies were observed at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum \nhuman exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nThere were no adverse reactions, with possible relevance to clinical use, seen in animals at clinically \nrelevant exposure levels which were not also observed in clinical studies. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Granpidam is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Granpidam \n3. How to take Granpidam \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Granpidam \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Granpidam is and what it is used for \n \nGranpidam contains the active substance sildenafil which belongs to a group of medicines called \nphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. \nGranpidam brings down blood pressure in the lungs by widening the blood vessels in the lungs. \nGranpidam is used to treat adults and children and adolescents from 1 to 17 years old with high blood \npressure in the blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary arterial hypertension). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Granpidam \n \nDo not take Granpidam \n-         if you are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n-         if you are taking medicines containing nitrates, or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrate \n\n(“poppers”). These medicines are often given for relief of chest pain (or “angina pectoris”). \nGranpidam can cause a serious increase in the effects of these medicines. Tell your doctor if you \nare taking any of these medicines. If you are not certain, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n-         if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high \nblood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high \nblood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots).
