NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTopotecan Hospira 4 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\n1 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride).\nEach 4 ml vial of concentrate contains 4 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).\n\nA clear yellow to yellow-green solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of:\n\uf0b7 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of first-line or subsequent therapy.\n\uf0b7 patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line \n\nregimen is not considered appropriate (see section 5.1).\n\nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix\nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to \ncisplatin require a sustained treatment-free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see \nsection 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Topotecan should only be administered under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n\nPosology\n\nWhen topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin \nshould be consulted.\n\nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count \nof \u22651.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of \u2265 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion \nif necessary).\n\nOvarian and small cell lung carcinoma \n\nInitial dose\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area perday administered by \nintravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three-week interval \nbetween the start of each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n3\n\nSubsequent doses\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is \u2265 1 x 109/l, the platelet count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n\nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts.\n\nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x \n109/l) for seven days or more or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who have had \ntreatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day to \n1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary).\n\nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical studies, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2/day and a further dose \nreduction was required to manage adverse effects.\n\nCervical carcinoma\n\nInitial dose\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as a 30-minute intravenous \ninfusion on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a dose of \n50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every 21 days for \nsix courses or until progressive disease.\n\nSubsequent doses\nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count \nis \u2265 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is \u2265 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n\nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts.\n\nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count \u02c2 \n0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or who \nhave had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20% to 0.60 mg/m2/day \nfor subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary).\n\nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l.\n\nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nMonotherapy (ovarian and small cell lung carcinoma):\nThere is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min). Use of topotecan in this group of patients is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \nLimited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment. The \nrecommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with ovarian or small cell lung carcinoma \nand a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days.\n\nCombination therapy (cervical carcinoma):\nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, \ntherapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5mg/dl. If, during \ntopotecan/cisplatin combination therapy, serum creatinine exceeds 1.5mg/dl, it is recommended that \nthe full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. \nIf cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with\ntopotecan in patients with cervical cancer.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in \ntopotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose \nrecommendation for this patient group (see section 4.4). \n\nThere is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired hepatic \nfunction (serum bilirubin \u2265 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in \nthis patient group (see section 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population\n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTopotecan must be reconstituted and further diluted before use (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\u2212 Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\n\u2212 Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\u2212 Severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by baseline neutrophils \n<1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be determined\nregularly (see section 4.2).\n\nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8).\n\nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have \nbeen reported in clinical studies with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia and a \ncompatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered.\n\nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been \nfatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, \nthoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating factors. \nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea \nand/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed.\n\nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with \nclinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing Topotecan\nHospira, e.g. if patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy.\n\nAs would be expected, patients with poor performance status (PS>1) have a lower response rate and \nan increased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). Accurate \nassessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that patients have \nnot deteriorated to PS 3.\n\nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin \n\n\n\n5\n\n\u2265 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Use of topotecan in these patient groups is not recommended (see section \n4.2).\n\nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in \ntopotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose \nrecommendation for this patient group (see section 4.2).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. \n\nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In a population study using the \nintravenous route, the co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did \nnot appear to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive \nform).\n\nWhen combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal \nproduct may be required to improve tolerability. However, when combining with platinum agents, \nthere is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on \nday 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan \ndosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each \nagent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing.\n\nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on day 1) were \nadministered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12%, n=9) and Cmax\n(23%, n=11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females\n\nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies \n(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and \ntherefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntherapy with topotecan. \n\nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients being treated with topotecan must be advised that they or \ntheir partner must use an effective method of contraception. \n\nPregnancy\n\nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nTopotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).  Although it is not known\nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start \nof therapy.\n\nFertility\n\nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats (see \nsection 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan is genotoxic and effects \non fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ncaution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nIn dose-finding studies involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with \nrelapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be \nhaematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative \nhaematological or non-haematological toxicity.\n\nThe safety profile of topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical cancer clinical \nstudies is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall haematological toxicity is \nlower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin compared to topotecan \nmonotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone.\n\nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin;\nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and were not attributable to topotecan. \nThe prescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events \nassociated with cisplatin use.\n\nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. \n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported events). \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \u02c21/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \u02c21/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nInfections and infestations\nVery common Infection \nCommon Sepsis1\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common Febrile neutropenia, neutropenia (see \n\n\u201cGastrointestinal disorders\u201d), thrombocytopenia, \nanaemia, leucopenia\n\nCommon Pancytopenia \nNot known Severe bleeding (associated with \n\nthrombocytopenia) \nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon Hypersensitivity reaction including rash \nRare Anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common Anorexia (which may be severe) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nRare Interstitial lung disease (some cases have been \n\nfatal) \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all of which may \n\nbe severe), constipation, abdominal pain2, \nmucositis \n\nNot known Gastrointestinal perforation \nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n\n\n7\n\nCommon Hyperbilirubinaemia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Alopecia \nCommon Pruritus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common Pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue \nCommon Malaise \nVery rare Extravasation3\n\nNot known Mucosal inflammation \n1Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated with topotecan (see section 4.4). \n2Neutropenic colitis, including fatal neutropenic colitis, has been reported to occur as a complication \nof topotecan-induced neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n3Reactions have been mild and have not generally required specific therapy. \n\nThe adverse events listed above have the potential to occur with a higher frequency in patients who \nhave a poor performance status (see section 4.4).\n\nThe frequencies associated with the haematological and non-haematological adverse events listed \nbelow represent the adverse event reports considered to be related/possibly related to topotecan \ntherapy.\n\nHaematological\nNeutropenia: Severe (neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/l) during course 1 in 55% of patients, with duration \n\u2265seven days in 20 % and overall in 77 % of patients (39 % of courses). In association with severe \nneutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 and overall in 23 % of \npatients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was nine days and the median \nduration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in 11 % of courses overall. \nAmong all patients treated in clinical studies (including both those with severe neutropenia and those \nwho did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) developed fever and 26 % (9 % of \ncourses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients treated (1 % of courses) developed sepsis \n(see section 4.4).\n\nThrombocytopenia: Severe (platelets <25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); moderate \n(platelets between 25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time to onset \nof severe thrombocytopenia, was day 15 and the median duration was five days.\nPlatelet transfusions were given in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with \nthrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds, have been infrequent.\n\nAnaemia: \nModerate to severe (Hb \u22648.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell transfusions were \ngiven in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses).\n\nNon-haematological\nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal, such as nausea (52 %), vomiting \n(32 %), diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). The incidence of severe (Grade 3 \nor 4) nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis  was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % respectively.\n\nMild abdominal pain was reported in 4 % of patients.\n\nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients receiving topotecan. \nSevere (Grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia both occurred with an incidence of 3 %.\n\nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients.\n\nOther severe events that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan treatment were \nanorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %). \n\n\n\n8\n\nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical studies, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of \npatients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdoses have been reported in patients being treated with intravenous topotecan (up to 10 fold of \nthe recommended dose) and topotecan capsules (up to 5 fold of the recommended dose). The signs and \nsymptoms observed following overdose were consistent with the known undesirable events associated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). The primary complications of overdose are bone marrow suppression \nand mucositis. In addition, elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported with intravenous topotecan \noverdose.\n\nThere is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. Further management should be as clinically \nindicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately \ninvolved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving \nreplication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme \nand strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of \ninhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA single-strand \nbreaks.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nRelapsed ovarian cancer\n\nIn a comparative study of topotecan and paclitaxel in patients previously treated for ovarian carcinoma \nwith platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 112 and 114, respectively), the response rate (95 % CI) was \n20.5 % (13 %, 28 %) versus 14 % (8 %, 20 %) and median time to progression 19 weeks versus \n15 weeks (hazard ratio 0.7 [0.6, 1.0]), for topotecan and paclitaxel, respectively. Median overall \nsurvival was 62 weeks for topotecan versus 53 weeks for paclitaxel (hazard ratio 0.9 [0.6, 1.3]).\n\nThe response rate in the whole ovarian carcinoma programme (n = 392, all previously treated with \ncisplatin or cisplatin and paclitaxel) was 16 %. The median time to response in clinical studies was \n7.6-11.6 weeks. In patients refractory to or relapsing within 3 months after cisplatin therapy (n = 186), \nthe response rate was 10 %.\n\nThese data should be evaluated in the context of the overall safety profile of the medicinal product, in \nparticular of the significant haematological toxicity (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n9\n\nA supplementary retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 523 patients with relapsed \novarian cancer. Overall, 87 complete and partial responses were observed, with 13 of these occurring \nduring cycles 5 and 6 and 3 occurring thereafter. Of the patients who received more than 6 cycles of \ntherapy, 91 % completed the study as planned or were treated until disease progression, with only 3 % \nwithdrawn for adverse events.\n\nRelapsed SCLC\n\nA phase III study (Study 478) compared oral topotecan plus best supportive care (BSC) (n=71) with \nBSC alone (n=70) in patients who had relapsed following first-line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan plus BSC, 90 days for BSC\nalone) and for whom re-treatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. In \nthe oral topotecan plus BSC group there was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival \ncompared with the BSC alone group (Log-rank p=0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for the oral \ntopotecan plus BSC group relative to the BSC alone group was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.90). Median \nsurvival in patients treated with oral topotecan plus BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 18.3, 31.6) \ncompared to 13.9 weeks (95 % CI: 11.1, 18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p=0.0104).\n\nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan plus BSC.\n\nOne Phase II study (Study 065) and one Phase III study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed \u226590 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-\nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies.\n\nTable 1.

Median time to \nprogression was similar in the two groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks, respectively).\n\n\n\n10\n\nMedian survivals for the two groups were 25.0 and 24.7 weeks, respectively. The hazard ratio for \nsurvival with IV topotecan relative to CAV was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.78 \u2013 1.40).\n\nThe response rate to topotecan in the combined small cell lung cancer programme (n = 480) for \npatients with relapsed disease sensitive to first-line therapy was 20.2 %. Median survival was \n30.3 weeks (95 % CI: 27.6, 33.4).\n\nIn a population of patients with refractory SCLC (those not responding to first-line therapy), the \nresponse rate to topotecan was 4.0%.\n\nCervical carcinoma\n\nIn a randomised, comparative Phase III study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG \n0179), topotecan plus cisplatin (n=147) was compared with cisplatin alone (n=146) for the treatment \nof histologically confirmed persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix where curative \ntreatment with surgery and/or radiation was not considered appropriate. Topotecan plus cisplatin had a \nstatistically significant benefit in overall survival relative to cisplatin monotherapy after adjusting for \ninterim analyses (Log-rank p =0.033).\n\nTable 2.

In those patients \n(n=102) with recurrence after 180 days, the median survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm was \n9.9 months (95% CI:: 7, 12.6) versus 6.3 months (95%CI:: 4.9, 9.5) for the cisplatin arm, with a \nhazard ratio of 0.75 (0.49, 1.16).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nTopotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on efficacy and \nsafety are available.\n\n\n\n11\n\nIn an open-label study involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or \nprogressive solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a 30-\nminute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on response to \ntherapy. Tumour types included were Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, \nneuroblastoma, osteoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Anti-tumour activity was demonstrated \nprimarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent \nand refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, \nforty-six (43%) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1%) courses; sixty-five (60%) received \ntransfusions of packed red blood cells and fifty (46%) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses \n(30.5% and 34.9%) respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the \nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day \nwithout G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see \nsection 5.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30-minute\ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22),\ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of\ndistribution, about 132l (SD 57), and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of\npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of\ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is \nlittle or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change \nin the pharmacokinetics after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of \ntopotecan is low (35%) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous.\n\nBiotransformation \n\nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of \ntopotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate.\n\nMetabolism accounts for <10% of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which \nwas shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, \nplasma and faeces. The mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio was < 10 % for both total topotecan and \ntopotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has been \nidentified in the urine.\n\nElimination\n\nOverall recovery of topotecan-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 71 to 76 % \nof the administered IV dose. Approximately 51% was excreted as total topotecan and 3 % was \nexcreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for \n18 % while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the N-desmethyl \nmetabolite contributed a mean of < 7% (range 4-9 %) of the total topotecan-related material accounted \nfor in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and N-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide in \nthe urine were < 2.0 %.\n\nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of N-\ndemethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A, nor did it inhibit the human cytosolic \nenzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase.\n\n\n\n12\n\nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of \ntopotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n=9]) (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \ndecreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was \nincreased by about 30 % but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma clearance \nof total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only decreased by \nabout 10 % compared with the control group of patients.\n\nRenal impairment \n\nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to \nabout 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus \nhalf-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma \nclearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from \n1.9 hours to 4.9 hours.\n\nAge/weight\n\nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect \non clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form).\n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two \nstudies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to 12 years, \nn = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9), and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, n = 9) with \nrefractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 to 5.2 mg/m2 in children \n(n = 8), adolescents (n = 3), and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these studies there were no \napparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, adolescents and young \nadult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to draw definite conclusions. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits.\n\nIn reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; \nhowever, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed.\n\nThe carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied.\n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Topotecan Hospira is and what it is used for\n\nTopotecan Hospira helps to destroy tumours. A doctor or a nurse will give you the medicine as an \ninfusion into a vein in hospital.\n\nTopotecan Hospira is used to treat:\n\n\uf0b7 ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer that has come back after chemotherapy.\n\n\uf0b7 advanced cervical cancer if surgery or radiotherapy treatment is not possible. When treating\ncervical cancer, Topotecan Hospira is combined with another medicine called \ncisplatin. \n\nYour doctor will decide with you whether Topotecan Hospira therapy is better than further treatment \nwith your initial chemotherapy.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Topotecan Hospira\n\nYou should not receive Topotecan Hospira:\n\u2022 if you are allergic to topotecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)\n\u2022 if you are breast-feeding\n\u2022 if your blood cell counts are too low. Your doctor will tell you whether this is the case, based on the \nresults of your last blood test.\n\nTell your doctor if any of these applies to you.\n\nWarnings and precautions \nBefore you are given this medicine \nyour doctor needs to know :\n\u2022 if you have any kidney or liver problems. Your dose of Topotecan Hospira may need to be \n\nadjusted.\n\u2022 if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. See section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d \n\nbelow.\n\u2022 if you plan to father a child. See section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d below.\n\n\n\n26\n\nTell your doctor if any of these applies to you.\n\nOther medicines and Topotecan Hospira\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, including \nany herbal products or medicines obtained without a prescription. Remember to tell your doctor if you \nstart to take any other medicines while you are on Topotecan Hospira.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTopotecan is not recommended for pregnant women. It may harm a baby conceived before, during or \nsoon after treatment. You should use an effective method of contraception. Ask your doctor for advice. \nDo not try to become pregnant until a doctor advises you it is safe to do so. \n\nMale patients who wish to father a child should ask their doctor for family planning advice or \ntreatment. If your partner becomes pregnant during your treatment, tell your doctor immediately.\n\nDo not breast-feed if you are being treated with topotecan. Do not restart breast-feeding until the \ndoctor tells you it is safe to do so.\n\nDriving and using machines\nTopotecan can make people feel tired. If you feel tired or weak, do not drive or use machines.\n\n3. How Topotecan Hospira is used\nThe dose of topotecan you are given will be worked out by your doctor, based on:\n\u2022 your body size (surface area measured in square metres)\n\u2022 the results of blood tests carried out before treatment \n\u2022 the disease being treated.\n\nThe usual dose\n\u2022 Ovarian and small cell lung cancer: 1.5 milligrams per m2 of body surface area per day.\nYou will have treatment once a day for 5 days. This pattern of treatment will normally be repeated \nevery 3 weeks.\n\u2022 Cervical cancer: 0.75 milligrams per m2 of body surface area per day. You will have treatment once \na day for 3 days. This pattern of treatment will normally be repeated every 3 weeks.\n\nWhen treating cervical cancer, Topotecan Hospira is combined with another medicine, called \ncisplatin. Your doctor will determine the correct dose of cisplatin. \n\nThe treatment may vary, depending on the results of your regular blood tests.\n\nHow topotecan is given\nA doctor or nurse will administer topotecan as an infusion into your arm lasting  about 30 minutes.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects: tell your doctor\n\nThese very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan \nHospira: \n\u2022 Signs of infection: Topotecan may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your resistance \nto infection. This can even be life threatening. Signs include:\n\n\uf02d fever\n\uf02d serious deterioration of your general condition\n\uf02d local symptoms such as sore throat or urinary problems (for example, a burning sensation \n\nwhen urinating, which may be a urinary infection).\n\n\n\n27\n\n\u2022 Occasionally severe stomach pain, fever and possibly diarrhoea (rarely with blood) can be signs of \nbowel inflammation (colitis) can be signs of bowel inflammation (colitis).\n\nThis rare side effect may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Topotecan Hospira:\n\u2022 Lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease): You are most at risk if you have existing lung \ndisease, have had radiation treatment to your lungs, or have previously taken medicines that caused \nlung damage. Signs include:\n\n\uf02d difficulty breathing\n\uf02d cough\n\uf02d fever\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you get any symptoms of these conditions, as hospitalisation may be \nnecessary.\n\nVery common side effects\nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan Hospira:\n\u2022 Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood \ntransfusion.\n\u2022 Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. This \ncan lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can lead to \nmore severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to minimise the risk of \nbleeding.\n\u2022 Weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); tiredness; weakness.\n\u2022 Feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting); diarrhoea; stomach pain; constipation.\n\u2022 Inflammation and ulcers of the mouth, tongue or gums.\n\u2022 High body temperature (fever).\n\u2022 Hair loss.\n\nCommon side effects\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan Hospira:\n\n\u2022 Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including rash).\n\u2022 Yellow skin.\n\u2022 Feeling unwell.\n\u2022 Itching sensation.\n\nRare side effects\nThese may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Topotecan Hospira:\n\n\u2022 Severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions.\n\u2022 Swelling caused by fluid build up (angioedema).\n\u2022 Mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection.\n\u2022 Itchy rash (or hives).\n\nSide effects with frequency not known \nThe frequency of some side effects is not known (events from spontaneous reports and the frequency \ncannot be estimated from the available data): \n\uf0b7 Severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting of blood, black or bloody stools (possible symptoms of \n\ngastrointestinal perforation). \n\n\uf0b7 Mouth sores, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloody stools \n(possible signs and symptoms of inflammation of the inner lining of the mouth, stomach \nand/or gut [mucosal inflammation]). \n\nIf you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine\n(cisplatin)that you will be given along with Topotecan Hospira. Those effects are described in the \ncisplatin patient leaflet. \n\n\n\n28\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

them. serious side effects: tell your doctor these very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with topotecan hospira: signs of infection: topotecan may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your resistance to infection. this can even be life threatening. signs include: fever serious deterioration of your general condition local symptoms such as sore throat or urinary problems (for example, a burning sensation when urinating, which may be a urinary infection). occasionally severe stomach pain, fever and possibly diarrhoea (rarely with blood) can be signs of bowel inflammation (colitis) can be signs of bowel inflammation (colitis). this rare side effect may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with topotecan hospira: lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease): you are most at risk if you have existing lung disease, have had radiation treatment to your lungs, or have previously taken medicines that caused lung damage. signs include: difficulty breathing cough fever tell your doctor immediately if you get any symptoms of these conditions, as hospitalisation may be necessary. very common side effects these may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with topotecan hospira: feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). in some cases you may need a blood transfusion. unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. this can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. rarely, it can lead to more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). talk to your doctor for advice on how to minimise the risk of bleeding. weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); tiredness; weakness. feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting); diarrhoea; stomach pain; constipation. inflammation and ulcers of the mouth, tongue or gums. high body temperature (fever). hair loss. common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with topotecan hospira: allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including rash). yellow skin. feeling unwell. itching sensation. rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with topotecan hospira: severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions. swelling caused by fluid build up (angioedema). mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection. itchy rash (or hives). side effects with frequency not known the frequency of some side effects is not known (events from spontaneous reports and the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting of blood, black or bloody stools (possible symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation). mouth sores, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloody stools (possible signs and symptoms of inflammation of the inner lining of the mouth, stomach and/or gut [mucosal inflammation]). if you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine (cisplatin)that you will be given along with topotecan hospira. those effects are described in the cisplatin patient leaflet. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side
