This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCaprelsa 100 mg film-coated tablets \nCaprelsa 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nCaprelsa 100 mg tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of vandetanib. \n \nCaprelsa 300 mg tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of vandetanib. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCaprelsa 100 mg tablets \nThe Caprelsa 100 mg tablet is a round, biconvex, white film-coated tablet with ‘Z100’ impressed on \none side. \n \nCaprelsa 300 mg tablets \nThe Caprelsa 300 mg tablet is an oval-shaped, biconvex, white film-coated tablet with ‘Z300’ \nimpressed on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCaprelsa is indicated for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer \n(MTC) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.  \n \nCaprelsa is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 5 years and older. \n \nFor patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, a \npossible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see \nimportant information in sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in treatment of MTC and in \nthe use of anticancer medicinal products and experienced in the assessment of electrocardiogram \n(ECG). \n \nOnly one supply per prescription is allowed. For a further supply, a new prescription is required. \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is less than 12 hours to \nthe next dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. Patients should not take a double dose (two \ndoses at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients treated with Caprelsa must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks of \nCaprelsa (see also package leaflet).  \n \nPosology for MTC in adult patients \nThe recommended dose is 300 mg once a day, taken with or without food at about the same time each \nday.  \n \nDose adjustments in adult patients with MTC \nQTc interval should be carefully assessed prior to initiation of treatment. In the event of common \nterminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the \nECG QTc interval, dosing with vandetanib should be at least temporarily stopped and resumed at a \nreduced dose when toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1 (see section 4.4). The \n300 mg daily dose can be reduced to 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets), and then to 100 mg if necessary. \nThe patient must be monitored appropriately. Due to the 19-day half-life, adverse reactions including a \nprolonged QTc interval may not resolve quickly (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology in paediatric patients with MTC \nDosing for paediatric patients should be on the basis of BSA in mg/m2. Paediatric patients treated with \nCaprelsa and patients’ caregivers must be given the dosing guide and be informed on the correct dose \nto be taken with the initial prescription and each subsequent dose adjustment. Recommended dosing \nregimens and dose modifications are presented in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Dosing nomogram for Paediatric Patients with MTC \nBSA (m2) Start dose (mg)a Dose increase (mg)b  \n\nwhen tolerated well  \nafter 8 weeks at starting \ndose \n\nDose reduction (mg) c \n\n0.7 - <0.9 100 every other day 100 daily - \n0.9 - <1.2 100 daily 7 day schedule: \n\n100-200-100-200-100-\n200-100 \n\n100 every other day \n\n1.2 - <1.6 7 day schedule: \n100-200-100-200-100-\n200-100 \n\n200 daily 100 daily \n\n≥ 1.6 200 daily 300 daily 7 day schedule: \n100-200-100-200-100-\n200-100 \n\na The starting dose is the dose at which treatment should be initiated \nb Higher vandetanib doses than 150 mg/m2 have not been used in clinical studies in paediatric patients  \nc Patients with an adverse reaction requiring a dose reduction should stop taking vandetanib for at least a week. Dosing can be \nresumed at a reduced dose thereafter when fully recovered from adverse reactions \n \nDose adjustments in paediatric patients with MTC \n\n\n\n4 \n\n In the event of CTCAE grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval,  \n dosing with vandetanib should be at least temporarily stopped and resumed at a reduced dose \n\nwhen toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1.  \n Patients who are on the starting dose (a in Table 1), should be recommenced at the reduced dose \n\n(c in Table 1).   \n Patients who are on the increased dose (b in Table 1), should be recommenced at the starting \n\ndose (a in Table 1). If another event of common terminology criteria for adverse events \n(CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval occurs, dosing \nwith Caprelsa should be at least temporarily stopped and resumed at a reduced dose (c in Table \n1) when toxicity has resolved or improved to CTCAE grade 1. \n\n If a further event of CTCAE grade 3 or higher toxicity or prolongation of the ECG QTc interval \noccurs, dosing with vandetanib should be permanently stopped. \n\n \nThe patient must be monitored appropriately. Due to the 19-day half-life, adverse reactions including a \nprolonged QTc interval may not resolve quickly (see section 4.4). \n \nDuration  \nVandetanib may be administered until disease progression or until the benefits of treatment \ncontinuation do no longer outweigh its risk, thereby considering the severity of adverse events (see \nsections 4.8) in relation to the degree of clinical stabilization of the tumour status. \n \nSpecial patient populations \nPaediatric population \nCaprelsa should not be given to children below 5 years of age. The safety and efficacy of Caprelsa in \nchildren below 5 years of age have not been established. No data are available. \nThere is no experience in paediatric patients with hereditary MTC below 9 years of age (see section \n5.1). Patients aged 5-18 years should be dosed according to the nomogram in Table 1. Vandetanib \ndoses higher than 150 mg/m2 have not been used in clinical studies in paediatric patients.  \n \nElderly \nNo adjustment in starting dose is required for elderly patients. There is limited clinical data with \nvandetanib in patients with MTC aged over 75. \n \nRenal impairment in adult patients with MTC \nA pharmacokinetic study in volunteers with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment shows that \nexposure to vandetanib after single dose is increased up to 1.5, 1.6 and 2-fold respectively in patients \nwith mild, moderate (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 50 ml/min) and severe (clearance below \n30 ml/min) renal impairment at baseline (see section 5.2). Clinical data suggest that no change in \nstarting dose is required in patients with mild renal impairment. There is limited data with 300 mg in \npatients with moderate renal impairment: the dose needed to be lowered to 200 mg in 5 out of 6 \npatients. The starting dose could be reduced to 200 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment; \nsafety and efficacy have however not been established with 200 mg (see section 4.4). Vandetanib is \nnot recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment since there is limited data in \npatients with severe renal impairment, and safety and efficacy have not been established. \n \nRenal impairment in paediatric patients with MTC \nThere is no experience with the use of vandetanib in paediatric patients with renal impairment.  \nConsidering the data available in adult patients with renal impairment: \n\n No change in starting dose is recommended in paediatric patients with mild renal impairment \n The reduced dose as specified in Table 1 could be used in paediatric patients with moderate \n\nrenal impairment. Individual patient management will be required by the physician, especially \nin paediatric patients with low BSA. \n\n Vandetanib is not recommended in paediatric patients with severe renal impairment \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHepatic impairment \nVandetanib is not recommended for use in adult and paediatric patients with hepatic impairment \n(serum bilirubin greater than 1.5 times upper limit of reference range (ULRR), this criterion does not \napply to patients with Gilbert’s Disease and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) greater than 2.5 times ULRR, or greater than \n5.0 times ULRR if judged by the physician to be related to liver metastases), since there is limited data \nin patients with hepatic impairment, and safety and efficacy have not been established (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPharmacokinetic data from volunteers, suggests that no change in starting dose is required in patients \nwith mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor patients who have difficulty swallowing, vandetanib tablets may be dispersed in half a glass of \nnon-carbonated drinking water. No other liquids should be used. The tablet is to be dropped in water, \nwithout crushing, stirred until dispersed (approximately 10 minutes) and the resultant dispersion \nswallowed immediately. Any residues in the glass are to be mixed with half a glass of water and \nswallowed. The liquid can also be administered through nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Congenital long QTc syndrome. \n Patients with a QTc interval over 480 msec.  \n Concomitant use of vandetanib with the following medicinal products known to also prolong \n\nthe QTc interval and/or induce Torsades de pointes: Arsenic, cisapride, erythromycin \nintravenous (IV), toremifene, mizolastine, moxifloxacin, Class IA and III antiarrhythmics (see \nsection 4.5). \n\n Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn view of the associated risks, it is important to limit treatment with vandetanib to patients who are in \nreal need for treatment, i.e. with a symptomatic-aggressive course of the disease. Either symptomatic \ndisease or progressive disease alone is not enough to prompt the need of treatment with vandetanib. \nRate of change in biomarker levels such as of calcitonin (CTN) and/or carcinoembryonic antigen \n(CEA) as well as the rate of change of tumour volume during watchful waiting might help to identify \nnot only patients in need for treatment but also the optimal moment to commence treatment with \nvandetanib. \n \nQTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes \nVandetanib at a dose of 300 mg is associated with a substantial and concentration dependent \nprolongation in QTc (mean 28 msec, median 35 msec). First QTc prolongations occurred most often in \nthe first 3 months of treatment, but continued to first occur after this time. The half-life of vandetanib \n(19 days) renders this prolongation in QTc interval particularly problematic (see section 4.8). At a \ndose of 300 mg per day in MTC, ECG QTc prolongation to above 500 msec was observed in a phase \nIII study in 11% of patients. ECG QTc prolongation appears to be dose-dependent. Torsades de \npointes and ventricular tachycardia have been uncommonly reported in patients administered \nvandetanib 300 mg daily. The risk of Torsades may be increased in patients with electrolyte imbalance \n(see section 4.8). \n \nVandetanib treatment must not be started in patients whose ECG QTc interval is greater than \n480 msec. Vandetanib should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes. \nVandetanib has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial \ninfarction. \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAn ECG, and levels of serum potassium, calcium and magnesium and thyroid stimulating hormone \n(TSH) should be obtained at baseline, at 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment and every \n3 months for at least a year thereafter. This schedule should apply to the period after dose reduction \ndue to QTc prolongation and after dose interruption for more than two weeks. ECGs and blood tests \nshould also be obtained as clinically indicated during this period and afterwards. Frequent ECG \nmonitoring of the QTc interval should be continued. \n \nSerum potassium, serum magnesium and serum calcium should be kept within normal range to reduce \nthe risk of ECG QTc prolongation. Additional monitoring of QTc, electrolytes and renal function are \nrequired especially in case of diarrhoea, increase in diarrhoea/dehydration, electrolyte imbalance \nand/or impaired renal function. If QTc increases markedly but stays below 500 msec, cardiologist \nadvice should be sought. \n \nThe administration of vandetanib with substances known to prolong the ECG QTc interval is \ncontraindicated or not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).  \n \nThe concomitant use of vandetanib with ondansetron is not recommended (see section 4.5) \n \nPatients who develop a single value of a QTc interval of ≥500 msec should stop taking \nvandetanib. Dosing can be resumed at a reduced dose after return of the QTc interval to \npretreatment status has been confirmed and correction of possible electrolyte imbalance has \nbeen made. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, PRES (Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy \nsyndrome-RPLS) \nPRES is a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic oedema diagnosed by a MRI of the brain, has been \nobserved infrequently with vandetanib treatment in combination with chemotherapy. PRES has also \nbeen observed in patients receiving vandetanib as monotherapy. This syndrome should be considered \nin any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental \nfunction. Brain MRI should be performed in any patient presenting with seizures, confusion or altered \nmental status. \n \nRearranged during transfection (RET) status \nPatients without RET mutation may have a decreased benefit from vandetanib treatment and the \nbenefit/risk balance for this group of patients may therefore differ from that of the group with RET \nmutations. For patients whose RET mutation status could be negative, a possible lower benefit should \nbe taken into account before individual treatment decisions and the use of vandetanib should be \ncarefully considered because of the treatment related risks. Therefore, RET mutation testing is \nrecommended. When establishing RET mutation status, tissue samples should be obtained if possible \nat the time of initiation of treatment rather than at the time of diagnosis (see sections 4.1 and 5.1). \n \nSkin reactions \nRash and other skin reactions including photosensitivity reactions and palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome have been observed in patients who have received vandetanib. \n \nMild to moderate skin reactions can be managed by symptomatic treatment, or by dose reduction or \ninterruption. For more severe skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome), referral of the \npatient to seek urgent medical advice is recommended.  \n \nCare should be taken with sun exposure by wearing protective clothing and/or sunscreen due to the \npotential risk of phototoxicity reactions associated with vandetanib treatment. \n \nDiarrhoea \nDiarrhoea is a disease related symptom as well as a known undesirable effect of vandetanib. Routine \nanti-diarrhoeal agents are recommended for the treatment of diarrhoea. QTc and serum electrolytes \nshould be monitored more frequently. If severe diarrhoea (CTCAE grade 3-4) develops, vandetanib \n\n\n\n7 \n\nshould be stopped until diarrhoea improves. Upon improvement, treatment should be resumed at a \nreduced dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHaemorrhage \nCaution should be used when administering vandetanib to patients with brain metastases, as \nintracranial haemorrhage has been reported. \n \nHeart failure \nHeart failure has been observed in patients who received vandetanib. Temporary or permanent \ndiscontinuation of therapy may be necessary in patients with heart failure. It may not be reversible on \nstopping vandetanib. Some cases have been fatal. \n \nHypertension \nHypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed in patients treated with vandetanib. \nPatients should be monitored for hypertension and controlled as appropriate. If high blood pressure \ncannot be controlled with medical management, vandetanib should not be restarted until the blood \npressure is controlled medically. Reduction in dose may be necessary (see section 4.8).  \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating vandetanib, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nVandetanib is not recommended for use in adult and paediatric patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment since there is limited data, and safety and efficacy have not been established (see \nsections 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nVandetanib is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin greater \nthan 1.5 times upper limit of normal), since there is limited data in patients with hepatic impairment, \nand safety and efficacy have not been established. Pharmacokinetic data from volunteers, suggests that \nno change in starting dose is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nAlanine aminotransferase elevations \nAlanine aminotransferase elevations occur commonly in patients treated with vandetanib. The \nmajority of elevations resolve while continuing treatment, others usually resolve after a 1-2 week \ninterruption in therapy. Periodic monitoring of alanine aminotransferase is recommended. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has been observed in patients receiving vandetanib and some cases \nhave been fatal. If a patient presents with respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, \nvandetanib treatment should be interrupted and prompt investigation initiated. If ILD is confirmed, \nvandetanib should be permanently discontinued and the patient treated appropriately.  \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nThe concomitant use of vandetanib with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampicin, St John’s Wort, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nCTN less than 500 pg/ml \nThe benefit of vandetanib in patients with CTN less than 500 pg/ml has not been determined, therefore \nuse in patients with CTN < 500 pg/ml should be carefully considered because of the treatment related \nrisks of vandetanib. \n \nPatient Alert Card  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAll prescribers of Caprelsa must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Caprelsa therapy with the patient. The \npatient will be provided with the Patient Alert Card with each prescription.  \n \n \n \nPaediatric population \nBased on height measurements at all visits, all children and adolescents in a paediatric study \ndemonstrated linear growth while receiving vandetanib. However, long term safety data in paediatric \npatients are not available. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \nEffect of vandetanib on other medicinal products \nIn healthy subjects, the exposure for midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) was not affected when given \ntogether with a single dose of vandetanib at 800 mg. \n \nVandetanib is an inhibitor of the organic cation 2 (OCT2) transporter. In healthy subjects with wild \ntype for OCT2, the AUC(0-t) and Cmax for metformin (OCT2 substrate) were increased by 74% and \n50%, respectively and CLR of metformin was decreased by 52% when given together with vandetanib. \nAppropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant \nmetformin and vandetanib, and such patients may require a lower dose of metformin. \n \nIn healthy subjects, the AUC(0-t) and Cmax for digoxin (P-gp substrate) were increased by 23% and 29% \nrespectively, when given together due to P-gp inhibition by vandetanib. Furthermore, the bradycardiac \neffect of digoxin may increase the risk of vandetanib QTc interval prolongation and Torsade de \nPointes. Therefore, an appropriate clinical (e.g. ECG) and/or laboratory monitoring is recommended \nfor patients receiving concomitant digoxin and vandetanib, and such patients may require a lower dose \nof digoxin. (For vandetanib monitoring, see section 4.2 Posology and Method of administration and \nsection 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). \n \nAs regards other P-gp substrates such as dabigatran, a clinical monitoring is recommended in case of \ncombination with vandetanib. \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on vandetanib \nIn healthy subjects, no clinically significant interaction was shown between vandetanib (a single dose \nof 300mg) and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (repeated doses of 200mg once daily). In \nhealthy male subjects, the exposure to vandetanib was reduced by 40% when given together with the \npotent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin. Administration of vandetanib with potent CYP3A4 inducers \nshould be avoided. \n \nIn healthy subjects, the Cmax for vandetanib was decreased by 15% while the AUC(0-t)  for vandetanib \nwas not affected when given together with omeprazole. Neither the Cmax nor the AUC(0-t) for \nvandetanib was affected when given together with ranitidine. Therefore, no change in dose of \nvandetanib is required when vandetanib is given with either omeprazole or ranitidine. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nBiliary excretion of unchanged vandetanib is one of the excretion pathways for vandetanib. \nVandetanib is not a substrate of multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \n \nMedicinal products known to prolong QTc interval \nVandetanib has been shown to prolong the ECG QTc interval; Torsades de pointes have been \nuncommonly reported. Therefore, the concomitant use of vandetanib with medicinal products known \n\n\n\n9 \n\nto also prolong the QTc interval and/or induce Torsades de pointes is either contraindicated or not \nrecommended depending on existing alternative therapies. \n \n Combinations contraindicated (see section 4.3): Cisapride, erythromycin intravenous (IV), \n\ntoremifene, mizolastine, moxifloxacin, arsenic, Class IA and III antiarrhythmics  \n Combinations not recommended: Methadone, haloperidol, amisulpride, chlorpromazine, \n\nsulpiride, zuclopenthixol, halofantrine, pentamidine and lumefantrine. \n \nIf there is no appropriate alternative therapy, not recommended combinations with vandetanib may be \nmade with additional ECG monitoring of the QTc interval, evaluation of electrolytes and further \ncontrol at onset or worsening of diarrhoea.  \n \nResults of a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction study indicated that co-administration \nwith ondansetron in healthy patients appeared to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nvandetanib, but had a small additive effect on the prolongation of the QTc interval of approximately \n10 ms. Therefore, the concomitant use of ondansetron with vandetanib is not recommended. If \nondansetron is administered with vandetanib, closer monitoring of serum electrolytes and ECGs and \naggressive management of any abnormalities is required. \n \nVitamin K antagonists \nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation is frequent. In \nconsideration of the high intra-individual variability of the response to anticoagulation, and the \npossibility of interaction between vitamin K antagonists and chemotherapy, an increased frequency of \nthe INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring is recommended, if it is decided to treat the \npatient with vitamin K antagonists. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during therapy and for at least four \nmonths following the last dose.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data on the use of vandetanib during pregnancy. As expected from its \npharmacological actions, vandetanib has shown significant effects on all stages of female reproduction \nin rats (see section 5.3). \n \nIf vandetanib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving vandetanib, \nshe should be apprised of the potential for foetal abnormalities or loss of the pregnancy. Treatment \nshould only be continued in pregnant women if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk \nto the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no data on the use of vandetanib in breast-feeding women. Vandetanib and/or its metabolites \nis excreted into milk in rats and found in plasma of pups following dosing to lactating rats (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding is contraindicated while receiving vandetanib therapy. \n \nFertility \nIn rats, vandetanib had no effect on male fertility but impaired female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \nEffects on reproduction in paediatric patients treated with vandetanib are not known. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nNo studies to establish the effects of vandetanib on ability to drive and use machines have been \nconducted. However, fatigue and blurred vision have been reported and those patients who experience \nthese symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines. \n \n \n \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profileThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions have been \ndiarrhoea, rash, nausea, hypertension, and headache. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical studies with patients receiving \nvandetanib as treatment for MTC. Their frequency is presented in Table 2, adverse reactions using \nCouncil for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS III), listed by MedDRA System \nOrgan Class (SOC) and at the preferred term level and then by frequency classification. Frequencies of \noccurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). This section includes only data derived from \ncompleted studies where patient exposure is known.  \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions and system organ class  \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not \nknown \n\nInfection and \ninfestation \ndisorders \n\nNasopharyngitis \nbronchitis, upper \nrespiratory tract \ninfections, urinary \ntract infections \n\nPneumonia, sepsis, \ninfluenza, cystitis, \nsinusitis, laryngitis, \nfolliculitis, furuncle, \nfungal infection, \npyelonephritis \n\nAppendicitis, \nstaphylococcal \ninfection, \ndiverticulitis, \ncellulitis, abdominal \nwall abscess \n\n \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n Hypothyroidism   \n\nMetabolism and  \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nAppetite decreased, \nHypocalcaemia  \n\nHypokalaemia, \nhypercalcaemia, \nhyperglycemia, \ndehydration, \nhyponatremia \n\nMalnutrition  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia, \nDepression \n\nAnxiety   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache, \nparaesthesia, \ndysaesthesia, \ndizziness  \n\nTremor, lethargy, loss \nof consciousness, \nbalance disorders, \ndysgeusia \n\nConvulsion, clonus, \nbrain oedema \n\n \n\nEye disorders Vision blurred, \ncorneal structural \nchange (including \ncorneal deposits \nand corneal \nopacity) \n\nVisual impairment, \nhalo vision, photopsia, \nglaucoma, \nconjunctivitis, dry eye, \nkeratopathy \n\nCataract, \naccommodation \ndisorders \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n \n \n\nProlongation of \nECG QTc \ninterval(*) (**) \n\n Heart failure, acute \nheart failure, rate and \nrhythm disorders, \ncardiac conduction \ndisorders, ventricular \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\narrhythmia and \ncardiac arrest \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHypertension Hypertensive crisis, \nischaemic \ncerebrovascular \nconditions \n\n Aneurysms \nand artery \ndissections \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Epistaxis, \nhaemoptysis, \npneumonitis \n\nRespiratory failure, \npneumonia \naspiration \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal pain, \ndiarrhoea, nausea, \nvomiting, \ndyspepsia \n\nColitis, dry mouth, \nstomatitis, dysphagia, \nconstipation, gastritis, \ngastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage \n\nPancreatitis, \nperitonitis, ileus, \nintestinal perforation, \nfaecal incontinence \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Cholelithiasis   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nPhotosensitivity \nreaction, rash and \nother skin rections \n(including acne, \ndry skin, \ndermatitis, \npruritus), nail \ndisorders \n\nPalmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthiesia \nsyndrome, alopecia \n \n\nBullous dermatitis \n \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\nProteinuria, \nnephrolithiasis \n\nDysuria, hematuria, \nrenal failure, \npollakiuria, \nmicturition urgency \n\nChromaturia, anuria  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nAsthenia, fatigue, \npain, oedema \n\nPyrexia Impaired healing  \n\nInvestigations \n \n\nECG QTc interval \nprolonged  \n \n\nIncrease of serum \nALT and AST, weight \ndecreased blood \ncreatinine increased  \n\nIncreased \nhaemoglobin,serum \namylase increased \n \n\n \n\n* 13.4% vandetanib patients had QTc (Bazett’s) ≥ 500 ms compared with 1.0% placebo patients.

Eight percent of patients \nhad a dose reduction due to QTc prolongation. \n** including two deaths in patients with QTc > 550 ms (one due to sepsis and one due to heart failure) \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nEvents such as Torsades de pointes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, interstitial lung \ndisease (sometimes fatal) and PRES (RPLS) have occurred in patients treated with vandetanib \nmonotherapy. It is expected that these would be uncommon adverse reactions in patients receiving \nvandetanib for MTC. \n \nOcular events such as blurred vision are common in patients who received vandetanib for MTC. \nScheduled slit lamp examinations have revealed corneal opacities (vortex keratopathies) in treated \npatients; however, routine slit lamp examinations are not required for patients receiving vandetanib. \n \nAt various exposure durations, median haemoglobin levels in patients treated with vandetanib were \nincreased by 0.5-1.5 g/dl compared to baseline. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n12 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric clinical trial data with vandetanib in MTC (see section 5.1) obtained during drug \ndevelopment is limited to 16 patients aged 9 years to 17 years with hereditary medullary thyroid \ncarcinoma (Study IRUSZACT0098). Whilst the study size is small owing to the rarity of MTC in \nchildren, it is considered representative of the target population. The safety findings in this study are \nconsistent with the safety profile of vandetanib in adult patients with MTC. Long term safety data in \npaediatric patients are not available. \n \n \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose with vandetanib and possible symptoms of \noverdose have not been established. An increase in the frequency and severity of some adverse \nreactions, like rash, diarrhoea and hypertension was observed at multiple doses at and above 300 mg in \nhealthy volunteer studies and in patients. In addition, the possibility of QTc prolongation and Torsades \nde pointes should be considered. Vandetanib doses higher than 150 mg/m2 have not been used in \nclinical studies in paediatric patients. \n \nAdverse reactions associated with overdose are to be treated symptomatically; in particular, severe \ndiarrhoea must be managed appropriately. In the event of an overdose, further doses must be \ninterrupted, and appropriate measures taken to assure that an adverse event has not occurred, i.e. ECG \nwithin 24 hours to determine QTc prolongation. Adverse reactions associated with overdose may be \nprolonged due to the long half-life of vandetanib (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC Code: L01XE12 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nVandetanib is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 also \nknown as kinase insert domain containing receptor [KDR]), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \nand RET tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib is also a sub-micromolar inhibitor of vascular endothelial \nreceptor-3 tyrosine kinase. \n \nVandetanib inhibits VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, survival and new blood \nvessel formation in in vitro models of angiogenesis. In addition, vandetanib inhibits epidermal growth \nfactor (EGF)-stimulated EGF receptor tyrosine kinase in tumour cells and endothelial cells. \nVandetanib inhibits EGFR-dependent cell proliferation and cell survival in vitro. Vandetanib also \ninhibits both wild type and the majority of mutated, activated forms of RET, and significantly inhibits \nthe proliferation of MTC cell lines in vitro. \n \nIn vivo vandetanib administration reduced tumour cell-induced angiogenesis, tumour vessel \npermeability, tumour microvessel density, and inhibited tumour growth of a range of human xenograft \ntumour models in athymic mice. Vandetanib also inhibited the growth of MTC xenograft tumours in \nvivo. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of vandetanib in locally advanced or metastatic MTC is unknown. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nClinical efficacy in adults \n \nClinical data from MTC  \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 58) was conducted to demonstrate safety \nand efficacy of vandetanib 300 mg versus placebo. This study included 331 patients with unresectable \nlocally advanced or metastatic MTC. Only patients with CTN ≥ 500 pg/mL (conventional units) or \n≥ 146.3 pmol/L (international standard units) were enrolled. Of the patients enrolled in the study \n10 patients on vandetanib and 4 on placebo (4% of all patients) had a World Health Organization \nperformance status (WHO PS) score of ≥ 2 and 28 (12.1%) patients on vandetanib and 10 (10.1%) on \nplacebo had cardiac impairment. Cardiac impairment was defined as patients with previous \ncardiovascular abnormality. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival \n(PFS) with vandetanib compared to placebo. The secondary endpoints were evaluation of overall \nobjective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) defined as, partial response (PR) or \ncomplete response (CR) or stable disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks, duration of response (DOR), \ntime to worsening of pain based on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst pain scale, and overall survival \n(OS). The PFS primary endpoint, ORR and DCR were based on centralized, independent blinded \nreview of the imaging data. Biochemical response with vandetanib as compared to placebo as \nmeasured by CTN and CEA was also assessed as secondary endpoints. \n \nPatients were treated with vandetanib or placebo until they reached objective disease progression. \nUpon objective disease progression based on the investigator’s assessment, patients were discontinued \nfrom blinded study treatment and given the option to receive open-label vandetanib. Twenty-eight of \nthe 231 patients (12.1%) on vandetanib and 3 of the 99 (3.0%) on placebo discontinued treatment \nbecause of an adverse event. Fourteen of the 28 patients (50%) who stopped vandetanib for an adverse \nevent discontinued without a dose reduction. Five out of 6 patients (83%) with moderate renal failure \nwho were treated with vandetanib had a dose reduction to 200 mg for adverse reaction; 1 patient \nrequired a further reduction to 100 mg. \n \nThe result of the primary analysis of PFS showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS for \npatients randomised to vandetanib compared to placebo (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.46; 95% Confidence \nInterval (CI) = 0.31-0.69; p=0.0001). \n \nThe median PFS for patients randomised to vandetanib has not been reached; however, based on \nstatistical modelling of data observed up to the 43rd percentile, the median PFS is predicted to be \n30.5 months with 95% confidence interval 25.5 to 36.5 months. The median PFS for patients \nrandomised to placebo was 19.3 months. At 12 months, the proportion of patients alive and \nprogression-free was 192 (83%) for patients randomised to vandetanib and 63 (63%) for patients \nrandomised to placebo. In the vandetanib arm, a total of 73 (32%) patients progressed: 64 (28%) by \nresponse evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) progression and 9 (4%) by death in the \nabsence of progression. The remaining 158 patients (68%) were censored in the analysis of PFS. In the \nplacebo arm, a total of 51 (51%) of patients had progressed: 46 (46%) by RECIST progression and 5 \n(5%) by death in the absence of progression. The remaining 49 patients (49%) were censored in the \nanalysis of PFS. \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier plot of PFS  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n \nmonths  0  6  12  18  24  30  36  \n\nn-vandetanib  231  196  169  140  40  1  0  \n\nn-placebo  100  71  57  45  13  0  0  \n \n____ vandetanib 300 mg, ------ placebo, y-axis=PFS, x-axis=time in months, n-vandetanib=number of patients at \nrisk-vandetanib, n-placebo=number of patients at risk-placebo \n \nHR = 0.46, 95%CI (0.31-0.69), p = 0.0001 \nPFS N Median PFS HR 95% CI p-value \nVandetanib 300 mg 73/231 \n\n(32%) \nNot reached \n(predicted \n30.5 months) \n\n \n \n0.46 \n\n \n \n0.31, 0.69 \n\n \n \n0.0001 \n\nPlacebo 51/100 \n(51%) \n\n19.3 months    \n\n \nSurvival status and the median final overall survival (81.6 months in the vandetanib arm and 80.4 \nmonths in the placebo arm) were similar across both treatment arms. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference in final OS (HR 0.99, 95.002% CI 0.72, 1.38, p=0.9750). Results should be \ninterpreted with caution due to the high percentage of patients in the placebo arm switching to open-\nlabel vandetanib (79.0% [79/100] of patients). \n \nMost (95% of the patients) had metastatic disease. Fourteen patients treated with vandetanib, and 3 \nwith placebo had unresectable locally advanced disease only. There is limited clinical experience with \nvandetanib in patients with unresectable locally advanced disease and without metastasis.  \n \nStatistically significant advantages were seen for vandetanib for the secondary endpoints of response \nrate, disease control rate, and biochemical response. \n \nTable 3: Summary of other efficacy findings in study 58 \nORRa N Response rate ORb 95% CI p-value \n\n Vandetanib 300 mg 104/231 45% \n5.48 2.99, 10.79 < 0.0001 \n\n Placebo 13/100 13% \n\nDCRa N Response rate ORb 95% CI p-value \n\n\n\n15 \n\n Vandetanib 300 mg 200/231 87% \n2.64 1.48, 4.69 0.001 \n\n Placebo 71/100 71% \n\nCTN Response \n \n\nN \nResponse rate ORb 95% CI p-value \n\n Vandetanib 300 mg 160/231 69% \n72.9 26.2, 303.2 < 0.0001 \n\n Placebo 3/100 3% \n\nCEA Response  N Response rate ORb 95% CI p-value \n\n Vandetanib 300 mg 119/231 52% \n52.0 16.0, 320.3 < 0.0001 \n\n Placebo 2/100 2% \n\nOVERALL SURVIVAL  N Median OS  HRc 95% CI p-value \n\n Vandetanib 300 mg 116/231 81.6 months 0.99 \n0.72, 1.38 \n\n \n0.9750  Placebo 52/100 80.4 months \n\n      \na  Overall response rate = complete + partial responses.

There were no statistically significant differences observed for the exploratory \nendpoint of diarrhoea (reported as stool frequency). \n \nRET mutation status in Study 58 \nIn Study 58, RET mutation testing was performed by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based \nAmplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) assay for the M918T mutation, and direct \nsequencing of DNA for mutations in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 (site of M918T mutation) on all \nsporadic patients where DNA was available (297/298).  \n \nHowever, RET status could not be tested in a large proportion of patients (mainly because of \nunavailable results for direct sequencing of DNA) and response rate was somewhat lower in the \npatients with unknown RET status compared with RET mutation positive status: 51.8% vs. 35.9 % \nrespectively. In the blinded comparison of vandetanib vs. placebo, only 2 patients known to be RET \nnegative at all 6 exons received vandetanib and none demonstrated responses. \n \nA post-hoc subgroup analysis of RET negative status based on absence of M918T mutation of the \npivotal study 58 was performed. A patient was considered to have a RET mutation if either an M918T \nmutation by the ARMS assay, or a RET mutation in any exons sequenced was present in the tumour. \nActually 79 patients were identified by absence of an M918T mutation and no RET mutation \nidentified at any of the other 6 exons tested but in 71 of such patients sequencing of the 6 exons was \nincomplete. M918T mutation is the most frequent mutation observed in patients with sporadic MTC; \nhowever it cannot be ruled out that some patients tested RET negative for M918T mutation might be \npositive for mutation on other exons. \n \nResults according to RET status (positive, unknown and RET M918T mutation negative definition) \nare presented in Table 4. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of efficacy findings in a segment of patients according to RET mutation \nstatus \n \n\n Patients with \ndocumented RET \nmutation  \n(n=187)  \n\nPatients with no \nM918T mutation \nand other \nmutations not \ntested or negative \n(n=79)* \n\nObjective response rate \n(vandetanib arm)  \n\n52%  35%  \n\nEfficacy endpoint \nPFS HR (95%) \nconfidence interval  \n\n0.45 (0.26, 0.78)  0.57 (0.29, 1.13)  \n\n*RET mutation status was obtained at the time of diagnosis in a majority of patients and could have changed \nsince. \n \nClinical efficacy in paediatric patients: \nA Phase I/II single-center open-label, single-arm study (Study IRUSZACT0098) assessed the activity \nof vandetanib in 16 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hereditary MTC. \nCharacteristics of the patients at study entry were the following: mean age 14.2 years (range 9-17 \nyears), 50% female, 50% male, 93.8% White, 26.7% Hispanic and 6.3% were Black. Most patients \n(81.3%) had undergone partial or total thyroidectomy prior to study entry. Starting vandetanib dose \nwas 100mg/m2/day for all patients except for one who started at 150mg/m2/day. After having well \ntolerated the first 1 or 2 cycles of therapy (1 cycle = 28 days), the remaining patients continued on 100 \nmg/m2 of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was ORR according to RECIST v 1.0. The \nobjective response rate observed was 43.8%, all of which were partial responses. 31.3% of patients \nhad stable disease for at least 8 weeks. Disease Control Rate including best response or Stable Disease \n>24 weeks was 75.0%. There is no experience with Caprelsa in patients 5-8 years of age in this study. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorized under a so-called “conditional approval” scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \n(EMA) will review new information on the product every year and this SmPC will be updated as \nnecessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration of vandetanib absorption is slow with peak plasma concentrations \ntypically achieved at a median of 6 hours, range 4-10 hours, after dosing. Vandetanib accumulates \napproximately 8-fold on multiple dosing with steady state achieved from approximately 2 months. \n \nDistribution \nVandetanib binds to human serum albumin and alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein with in vitro protein binding \nbeing approximately 90%. In ex vivo plasma samples from colorectal cancer patients at steady state \nexposure after 300 mg once daily, the mean percentage protein binding was 93.7% (range 92.2 to \n95.7%). The pharmacokinetics of vandetanib at the 300 mg dose in MTC patients are characterised by \na volume of distribution of approximately 7450 l.  \n \nBiotransformation \nFollowing oral dosing of 14C- vandetanib, unchanged vandetanib and metabolites vandetanib N-oxide \nand N-desmethyl vandetanib were detected in plasma, urine and feces. A glucuronide conjugate was \nseen as a minor metabolite in excreta only. N-desmethyl-vandetanib is primarily produced by \n\n\n\n17 \n\nCYP3A4, and vandetanib-N-oxide by flavin-containing monooxygenase enzymes (FM01 and FMO3). \nN-desmethyl-vandetanib and vandetanib-N-oxide circulate at concentrations of approximately 11% \nand 1.4% of those of vandetanib. \n \nElimination \nThe pharmacokinetics of vandetanib at the 300 mg dose in MTC patients are characterised by a \nclearance of approximately 13.2 l/h. and plasma half-life of approximately 19 days. Within a 21 day \ncollection period after a single dose of 14C-vandetanib, approximately 69% was recovered with 44% in \nfaeces and 25% in urine. Excretion of the dose was slow and further excretion beyond 21 days would \nbe expected based on the plasma half-life. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nA single dose pharmacokinetic study in volunteers indicated that exposure to vandetanib is enhanced \n(up to 1.5, 1.6 and 2-fold) in mild, moderate and severe renal impaired subjects respectively compared \nto subjects with normal renal function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single dose pharmacokinetic study in volunteers indicated that hepatic impairment did not affect \nexposure to vandetanib. There is limited data in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin \ngreater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nFood effect \nExposure to vandetanib is not affected by food. \n \nPharmacokinetics in paediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of vandetanib in paediatrics MTC patients aged 9-17 years were \nsimilar to those in adults. Vandetanib exposure in children between 5-8 years old with glioma-related \nindications was comparable to MTC patients aged 9-18 years. Dosing at 100mg/m2/day of the \nindicated posology (function of BSA) in paediatrics delivers similar exposure to that achieved in \nadults at 300 mg daily. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nVandetanib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential. \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 9 months duration, effects included emesis, body weight loss \nand diarrhoea in dogs and physeal dysplasia in young dogs and rats with open growth plates. In rats, \neffects on teeth, kidney and skin were noted. These findings occurred at clinically-relevant plasma \nconcentrations, were largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing and were attributable to \ninhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or EGFR.  \n \nEffects noted in other studies included inhibition of human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) current \nand prolongation of QTc interval in dogs. Elevation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was \nobserved in rats and dogs. In mice, vandetanib was shown to delay but not prevent wound healing. \nVandetanib also showed evidence of phototoxic potential in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. In an \nanimal model of wound-healing, mice dosed with vandetanib had reduced skin-breaking strength \ncompared with controls. This suggests that vandetanib slows but does not prevent wound healing. The \nappropriate interval between discontinuation of vandetanib and subsequent elective surgery required to \navoid the risks of impaired wound healing has not been determined. In clinical studies, a small number \nof patients had surgery while receiving vandetanib and there were no reported wound healing \ncomplications. \n \nReproductive toxicology \nVandetanib had no effect on fertility in male rats. In a female fertility study, there was a trend towards \nincreased oestrus cycle irregularity, a slight reduction in pregnancy incidence and increase in \n\n\n\n18 \n\nimplantation loss. In a repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, there was a decrease in the number of \ncorpora lutea in the ovaries of rats given vandetanib for 1 month. \n \nIn rats, embryofoetal toxicity was evident as foetal loss, delayed foetal development, heart vessel \nabnormalities and precocious ossification of some skull bones. In a rat pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment study, at doses producing maternal toxicity during gestation and/or lactation, vandetanib \nincreased pre-birth loss and reduced post-natal pup growth. Vandetanib was excreted into milk in rat \nand found in plasma of pups following dosing to lactating rats. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n Vandetanib has shown no carcinogenic potential effect in a 6 month carcinogenicity study in \nrasH2 transgenic mice. A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats was impaired by low survival in \nthe high dose female group and limited exposure of the animals to vandetanib; however, no \ncarcinogenic effects were observed in the remaining animals.  \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nIn addition to this leaflet you will be given the Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \ninformation that you need to know before you are given Caprelsa and during treatment with Caprelsa. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet and the patient alert card. You may need to read it again. \n- It is important that you keep the Alert Card with you during treatment.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Caprelsa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Caprelsa \n3. How to take Caprelsa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Caprelsa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Caprelsa is and what it is used for \n \nCaprelsa is a treatment for adults and children aged 5 years and above with: \n \nMedullary thyroid cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. \n \nCaprelsa works by slowing down the growth of new blood vessels in tumours (cancers). This cuts off \nthe supply of food and oxygen to the tumour. Caprelsa may also act directly on cancer cells to kill \nthem or slow down their growth. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Caprelsa \n \nDo not take Caprelsa: \n- if you are allergic to vandetanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6). \n- if you have a heart problem that you were born with called ‘congenital long QTc syndrome’. \n\nThis is seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: arsenic, cisapride (used to treat heartburn), \n\nerythromycin intravenous and moxifloxacin (used to treat infection), toremifene (used to treat \nbreast cancer), mizolastine (used to treat allergies), Class IA and III antiarrhythmics (used to \ncontrol heart rhythm). \n\n \nDo not take Caprelsa if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Caprelsa: \n If you are sensitive to the sun. Some people who are taking Caprelsa become more sensitive to \n\nthe sun. This can cause sunburn.
