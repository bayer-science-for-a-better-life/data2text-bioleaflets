NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPelzont 1,000 mg/20 mg modified-release tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach modified-release tablet contains 1,000 mg of nicotinic acid and 20 mg of laropiprant. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \nEach modified-release tablet contains 128.4 mg of lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nModified-release tablet. \n \nCapsule-shaped, white to off-white tablet, with \u201c552\u201d debossed on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPelzont is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, particularly in adult patients with combined \nmixed dyslipidaemia (characterised by elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low \nHDL-cholesterol) and in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and \nnon-familial). \n \nPelzont should be used in patients in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), when \nthe cholesterol lowering effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor monotherapy is inadequate. It can be \nused as monotherapy only in patients in whom HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are considered \ninappropriate or not tolerated. Diet and other non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. exercise, weight \nreduction) should be continued during therapy with Pelzont. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe starting dose is one modified-release tablet (1,000 mg nicotinic acid/20 mg laropiprant) once a \nday. After four weeks, it is recommended that patients be advanced to the maintenance dose of \n2,000 mg/40 mg taken as two modified-release tablets (1,000 mg/20 mg each) once daily. Daily doses \ngreater than 2,000 mg/40 mg have not been studied and therefore are not recommended. \n \nIf Pelzont is missed for less than 7 consecutive days, patients can resume therapy at the last \nadministered dose. If Pelzont is missed for 7 or more consecutive days, therapy should be resumed at \nthe 1,000 mg/20 mg dose for 1 week, before advancing to the maintenance dose of 2,000 mg/40 mg.  \n \nThose patients switching from 2,000 mg or more of prolonged-release nicotinic acid can initiate \nPelzont at the 2,000 mg/40 mg dose. Patients switching from less than 2,000 mg of prolonged-release \nnicotinic acid should initiate therapy at the starting dose of 1,000 mg/20 mg and advance to the \n2,000 mg/40 mg maintenance dose after four weeks. For patients switching from immediate-release \nnicotinic acid to Pelzont, therapy should be initiated at the 1,000 mg/20 mg dose and advanced to the \n2,000 mg/40 mg maintenance dose after four weeks. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and effectiveness of Pelzont in paediatric patients under the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal insufficiency \nUse of Pelzont in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied. Like other nicotinic \nacid medicinal products, Pelzont is contraindicated in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic \ndysfunction. It should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency, because nicotinic acid \nand its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant therapy \nAcetylsalicylic acid provides no additional reduction of flushing beyond that achieved by Pelzont. \nTherefore, treatment with acetylsalicylic acid to alleviate flushing symptoms is not necessary (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nBecause co-administration of bile acid sequestrants may reduce the bioavailability of acidic medicinal \nproducts such as nicotinic acid, it is recommended that Pelzont be administered > 1 hour before or \n> 4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe tablets should be taken whole, with food, in the evening or at bedtime. To preserve the \nmodified-release properties, the tablets must not be split, broken, crushed, or chewed before \nswallowing. To reduce the possibility of flushing, drinking alcohol or hot drinks or eating spicy foods \nshould be avoided at the time of ingestion of the medicinal product. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction. \n\u2022 Active peptic ulcer disease. \n\u2022 Arterial bleeding. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen Pelzont is co-administered with a statin, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics \nfor that particular medicinal product. \n \nHepatic effects  \nSwitching from immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid to Pelzont has not been studied. \nHowever, cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in \npatients who have switched from immediate-release nicotinic acid to long-acting nicotinic acid at \nequivalent doses. Therefore, patients switching from immediate-release nicotinic acid to Pelzont \nshould be initiated at the 1,000 mg/20 mg dose.  \n \nPelzont should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or \nhave a past history of liver disease.  \n \nLike other lipid-lowering therapies, nicotinic acid medicinal products have been associated with \nabnormal liver function tests (see section 4.8). Transaminase elevations were reversible upon \ndiscontinuation of therapy. \n \nLiver function tests are recommended before initiation, every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year, and \nperiodically (e.g. semi-annually) thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should \nbe monitored until the abnormalities have resolved. Should an increase in alanine aminotransferase \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n(ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of \u2265 3 X ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of \nPelzont is recommended.  \n \nEffect on skeletal muscle \nRare cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of \nlipid-altering doses (\u2265 1,000 mg/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) \n(see section 4.8). \n \nPhysicians contemplating combined therapy with statins and Pelzont should carefully weigh the \npotential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of \nmuscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and when the \ndose of either medicinal product is increased. Periodic serum creatine kinase (CK) should be \nconsidered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the \noccurrence of severe myopathy. \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients with pre-disposing factors for rhabdomyolysis. \n\u2022 Age > 70 years \n\u2022 Renal impairment \n\u2022 Uncontrolled hypothyroidism \n\u2022 Personal or familial history of hereditary muscular disorders \n\u2022 Previous history of muscular toxicity with a statin or fibrate \n\u2022 Alcohol abuse. \n \nIf muscle pain, weakness or cramps occur while a patient is receiving Pelzont with a statin, their CK \nlevels should be measured. If these levels are found, in the absence of strenuous exercise, to be \nsignificantly elevated (> 5 x ULN), treatment should be stopped. \n \nRace \nIn an interim analysis of an ongoing clinical outcome study, an independent safety monitoring \ncommittee identified a higher than expected incidence of myopathy in Chinese patients taking Pelzont \nand simvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with Pelzont \nco-administered with simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin (particularly simvastatin doses of 40 mg or \nhigher). Because the risk of myopathy with statins is dose-related, the use of Pelzont with simvastatin \n80 mg or ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/80 mg is not recommended in Chinese patients. It is unknown \nwhether there is an increased risk of myopathy in other Asian patients treated with Pelzont \nco-administered with simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin. \n \nRenal dysfunction \nBecause nicotinic acid and its metabolites are excreted through the kidneys, Pelzont should be used \nwith caution in patients with renal dysfunction.  \n \nEffect on glucose \nNicotinic acid medicinal products have been associated with increases of fasting blood glucose levels \n(see section 4.8). Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of \ndiet and/or hypoglycaemic therapy may be necessary. \n \nAcute coronary syndrome \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, caution should be used when Pelzont is used in \npatients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also \nreceiving vasoactive medicinal products such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic \nblocking agents. \n \nHaematologic effects \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, Pelzont (2,000 mg/40 mg) was associated with small \nreductions in platelet count (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients undergoing surgery should be \ncarefully evaluated. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nEffect on uric acid \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, Pelzont (2,000 mg/40 mg) was associated with small \nincreases in uric acid levels (see section 4.8). Therefore, Pelzont should be used with caution in \npatients with or predisposed to gout. \n \nHypophosphatemia \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, Pelzont was associated with small decreases in \nphosphorus levels. Therefore, patients with a risk for hypophosphatemia should be closely followed. \n \nOther information \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, patients with a history of jaundice, hepato-biliary \ndisorder or peptic ulcer should be observed closely (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nExcipient \nPelzont contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDrinking alcohol or hot drinks or eating spicy foods can enhance the effects of flushing and should \ntherefore be avoided around the time of ingestion of Pelzont. \n \nNicotinic acid  \nEffects of nicotinic acid on other medicinal products \nAntihypertensive therapy: Nicotinic acid may potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and \nvasoactive medicinal products such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and adrenergic receptor \nblocking agents, resulting in postural hypotension. \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: When simvastatin is combined with nicotinic acid, a modest increase \nin AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid (the active form of simvastatin) was observed, which may be \ndevoid of clinical relevance. The pharmacokinetic interaction of Pelzont with statins has been studied \nonly with simvastatin (see section 4.4). \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on nicotinic acid \nBile acid sequestrants: Because co-administration of bile acid sequestrants may reduce the \nbioavailability of acidic medicinal products such as nicotinic acid, it is recommended that Pelzont be \nadministered > 1 hour before or > 4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant. \n \nSupplements containing nicotinic acid: Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing \n(\u2265 50 mg/day) of nicotinic acid (or nicotinamide) have not been studied with Pelzont. Physicians \nshould consider the nicotinic acid intake from vitamins and nutritional supplements when prescribing \nPelzont. \n \nMedicinal product /laboratory test interactions: In urine glucose tests, nicotinic acid may also give \nfalse-positive reactions with cupric sulfate solution (Benedict\u2019s reagent). \n \nLaropiprant \nEffects of laropiprant on other medicinal products \nMidazolam: Multiple doses of laropiprant 40 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a \nsensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Therefore, laropiprant is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4. \nHowever, the plasma concentration of a metabolite of midazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, was \nincreased approximately 2-fold with multiple doses of laropiprant. Because 1'-hydroxymidazolam is \nan active metabolite, the sedative effect of midazolam may be increased and caution should be used \nwhen laropiprant is co-administered with midazolam. \n \nOther medicinal products: Co-administration of laropiprant 40 mg with midazolam increased the \nAUC0-\u221e and Cmax of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, a midazolam metabolite, by 98 % and 59 %, respectively. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n1'-hydroxymidazolam is metabolised predominantly by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases \n(UGT) 2B4 and 2B7. Clinical and in vitro studies support the conclusion that laropiprant is a mild to \nmoderate inhibitor of UGT2B4/UGT2B7. Very few medicinal products are known to be metabolised \npredominantly by UGT2B4 or UGT2B7. Caution should be used when Pelzont is co-administered \nwith medicinal products metabolised predominantly by UGT2B4 or UGT2B7, for instance zidovudine. \n \nIn interaction studies, laropiprant did not have clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of \nthe following medicinal products: simvastatin, warfarin, oral contraceptives, rosiglitazone and digoxin. \nBased on these data, laropiprant is not expected to cause interactions with substrates of CYP isozymes \n3A4, 2C9, 2C8 and human P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In in vitro studies, laropiprant did not inhibit \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1-mediated reactions. \n \nClopidogrel: In a clinical study, there was no meaningful effect of laropiprant on the inhibition of \nADP-induced platelet aggregation by clopidogrel, but there was a modest increase in the inhibition of \ncollagen-induced platelet aggregation by clopidogrel. This effect is unlikely to be clinically important \nas laropiprant did not increase bleeding time when co-administered with clopidogrel throughout the \ndosing interval. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of laropiprant with acetylsalicylic \nacid did not have an effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation or on bleeding time compared to \ntreatment with acetylsalicylic acid alone (see section 5.1). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel: In a clinical study in dyslipidaemic patients receiving both \nacetylsalicylic acid (81 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg), laropiprant induced transient (4 hours post-dose) \ninhibition of platelet function in vivo (as evaluated by bleeding time and platelet aggregation studies), \nbut had little effect across the dosing interval. Patients receiving Pelzont concomitantly with \nacetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel should be closely monitored as recommended in the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for those medicinal products and should be told that it might take longer than \nusual to stop bleeding and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) to their \nphysician. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on laropiprant \nCYP3A4 Inhibitor: Clarithromycin (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp) did not have a clinically \nmeaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant. Laropiprant is not a substrate of human P-gp, \nand therefore other inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp are also not expected to have a clinically \nmeaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nPelzont \nThere are no data from the combined use of nicotinic acid and laropiprant in pregnant women. The \ncombination has not been tested in reproductive toxicity studies. The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Therefore, Pelzont should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nNicotinic acid \nThere are no adequate data from the use of high dose nicotinic acid in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown foetal developmental toxicity at high doses of nicotinic acid (see section 5.3). \n \nLaropiprant \nThere are no data from the use of laropiprant in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nfoetal developmental toxicity at high doses of laropiprant (see section 5.3). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \nPelzont \nNo studies in lactating animals have been conducted with Pelzont. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy should be made taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Pelzont to the woman. \n \nNicotinic acid \nNicotinic acid is excreted in human breast milk. \n \nLaropiprant \nIt is unknown whether laropiprant is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of laropiprant in milk. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to impairment on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been \nreported (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical trials, over 5,700 patients received Pelzont alone or with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nFlushing is the most common adverse reaction of Pelzont. Flushing is most prominent in the head, \nneck, and upper torso. In a pool of four active- or placebo-controlled clinical trials (N=4,747, n=2,548 \ntaking Pelzont), flushing was reported in 12.3 % of patients taking Pelzont. In these studies, the \npercentage of patients taking Pelzont, nicotinic acid (pooled prolonged-release formulations) or pooled \nplacebo/simvastatin who discontinued due to any flushing-related symptom (redness, warmth, itching \nand tingling) was 7.2 %, 16.6 %, and 0.4 %, respectively. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and/or post-marketing use \nwith Pelzont (with or without a statin).  \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are ranked according to the following: Very common (\u2265 1/10), \nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), Rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), Very \nrare (< 1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Rare: rhinitis \nImmune system disorders Uncommon: hypersensitivity reaction (see below) \n\nRare: angio-oedema; type I hypersensitivity \nNot known: anaphylactic shock \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: gout \nRare: impaired glucose tolerance \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: insomnia \nRare: anxiety \n\nNervous system disorders Common: headache; paraesthesia \nUncommon: dizziness \nRare: migraine; syncope \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon: palpitations  \nRare: atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias; tachycardia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction \nVascular disorders Very common: flushing \n\nUncommon: hypotension \nRare: orthostatic hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon: dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: abdominal pain; diarrhoea; dyspepsia; nausea; vomiting  \nRare: mouth oedema; eructation; peptic ulcer \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Not known: jaundice \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: erythema; pruritus; rash; urticaria \nUncommon: dry skin; macular rash \nRare: acanthosis nigricans; hyperpigmentation; sweating (night or \ncold sweat) \nNot known: vesicular or vesiculobullous rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon: myalgia \nRare: muscular weakness \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon: feeling hot \nUncommon: chills; pain; peripheral oedema \nRare: asthaenia; face oedema; generalised oedema \n\nInvestigations Common: elevations in ALT and/or AST (consecutive, \n\u2265 3 X ULN), fasting glucose (see below) \nUncommon: elevations in CK (\u2265 10 X ULN), LDH, uric acid (see \nbelow) \nRare: elevations in total bilirubin, amylase; reductions in \nphosphorus and platelet counts (see below) \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nAn apparent hypersensitivity reaction has been reported (< 1 %). This is characterised by multiple \nsymptoms that may include: angio-oedema, pruritus, erythema, paraesthesia, loss of consciousness, \nvomiting, urticaria, flushing, dyspnoea, nausea, incontinence of urine and stool, cold sweats, shivering, \nchills, increased blood pressure, lip swelling, burning sensation, drug eruption, arthralgia, leg swelling, \nand tachycardia. \n \nInvestigations \nMarked and persistent increases of serum transaminases have been reported infrequently (see \nsection 4.4). In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of clinically important elevations in serum \ntransaminases (ALT and/or AST \u2265 3 X ULN, consecutive) was 1.0 % for patients treated with Pelzont \nwith or without a statin. These elevations were generally asymptomatic and returned to baseline after \ndiscontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment. \n \nClinically important elevations of CK (\u2265 10 X ULN) were seen in 0.3 % of the patients treated with \nPelzont with or without a statin (see section 4.4). \n \nOther abnormal laboratory values reported were elevations in LDH, fasting glucose, uric acid, total \nbilirubin, and amylase, and reductions in phosphorus and platelet counts (see section 4.4). \n \nAs with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, elevations in fasting glucose (a median increase of \napproximately 4 mg/dL), and uric acid (mean change from baseline of +14.7 %), and reductions in \nplatelet counts (a mean change from baseline of -14.0 %) were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith Pelzont (2,000 mg/40 mg) (see section 4.4). In diabetic patients a median increase in HbA1c of \n0.2 % was observed (where modification of hypoglycaemic therapy was allowed). \n \nAdditional adverse reactions reported with other nicotinic acid medical products \nAdditional adverse reactions that have been reported with other nicotinic acid medicinal products \n(with or without a statin) in post-marketing use or in clinical trials include the following: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nEye disorders: Cystoid macular oedema, toxic amblyopia. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nPelzont \nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual symptomatic and supportive \nmeasures. Cases of overdose have been reported; the maximum dose of Pelzont taken was \n5,000 mg/100 mg. All patients recovered without sequelae. The most commonly reported adverse \nreactions from the subjects who received this higher dose were consistent with a high dose of nicotinic \nacid and included: flushing, headache, pruritus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and \nabdominal pain/discomfort, and back pain. Laboratory abnormalities included increased amylase and \nlipase, decreased haematocrit and occult blood in the stool. \n \nNicotinic acid \nFor an overdose of nicotinic acid, supportive measures should be employed.  \n \nLaropiprant \nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 900 mg laropiprant and \nmultiple doses up to 450 mg once daily for 10 days were generally well tolerated. There is no \nexperience with doses of laropiprant above 900 mg in humans. Prolongation of collagen-induced \nplatelet aggregation was observed in subjects taking multiple doses of 300 mg or greater (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agents, nicotinic acid and derivatives, ATC code: \nC10AD52. \n \nPelzont contains nicotinic acid, which at therapeutic doses is a lipid-modifying agent, and laropiprant, \na potent, selective antagonist of the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) receptor subtype 1 (DP1). Nicotinic acid \nlowers the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), very low \ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B, the major LDL protein), \ntriglycerides (TG), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a), a modified LDL particle) and elevates the levels of \nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I, the major protein \ncomponent of HDL). Laropiprant suppresses PGD2 mediated flushing associated with administration \nof nicotinic acid. Laropiprant has no effect on lipid levels nor does it interfere with the effects of \nnicotinic acid on lipids.  \n \nNicotinic acid \nMechanism of action \nThe mechanisms by which nicotinic acid modifies the plasma lipid profile are not fully understood. \nNicotinic acid inhibits release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue, which may contribute to \nthe reduced plasma LDL-C, TC, VLDL-C, apo B, TG, and Lp(a), as well as elevated HDL-C, and apo \nA-I, all of which are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Additional explanations that do not \ninvoke plasma FFA reduction as the central driver of lipid profile modification include nicotinic \nacid-mediated inhibition of de novo lipogenesis or esterification of fatty acids into TG in the liver.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nNicotinic acid causes a relative shift in the distribution of LDL subclasses from small, dense (most \natherogenic) LDL particles to larger LDL particles. Nicotinic acid also elevates the HDL2 subfraction \nto a greater extent than the HDL3 subfraction, thereby increasing the HDL2:HDL3 ratio, which is \nassociated with decreased cardiovascular disease risk. HDL is hypothesised to participate in the \ntransport of cholesterol from tissues back to the liver, to suppress vascular inflammation associated \nwith atherosclerosis, and to have anti-oxidative and anti-thrombotic effects.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nLike LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density \nlipoproteins (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG levels are \nfrequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association \nwith non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).  \n \nTreatment with nicotinic acid reduces the risk of death and cardiovascular events, and slows \nprogression or promotes regression of atherosclerotic lesions. The Coronary Drug Project, a five year \nstudy completed in 1975, showed that nicotinic acid had a statistically significant benefit in decreasing \nnonfatal, recurrent myocardial infarctions (MI) in men 30 to 64 years old with a history of MI. Though \ntotal mortality was similar in the two groups at five years, in a fifteen-year cumulative follow-up there \nwere 11 % fewer deaths in the nicotinic acid group compared to the placebo cohort. \n \nLaropiprant \nMechanism of action \nNicotinic acid-induced flushing is mediated primarily by release of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in the \nskin. Genetic and pharmacologic studies in animal models have provided evidence that PGD2, acting \nthrough DP1, one of the two receptors for PGD2, plays a key role in nicotinic acid-induced flushing. \nLaropiprant is a potent and selective antagonist of DP1. Laropiprant is not expected to inhibit the \nproduction of prostaglandins. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nLaropiprant has been shown to be effective in reducing flushing symptoms induced by nicotinic acid. \nThe reduction in flushing symptoms (assessed by patient questionnaires) was correlated with a \nreduction in nicotinic acid-induced vasodilatation (assessed by measurements of skin blood flow). In \nhealthy subjects receiving Pelzont, pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg had no additional \nbeneficial effects in reducing nicotinic acid-induced flushing symptoms compared to Pelzont alone \n(see section 4.8). \n \nLaropiprant also has affinity for the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) (although it is substantially less \npotent at TP as compared to DP1). TP plays a role in platelet function; however, therapeutic doses of \nlaropiprant had no clinically relevant effect on bleeding time and collagen-induced platelet \naggregation (see section 4.5). \n \nClinical studies \nEffect on lipids \nPelzont was consistently efficacious across all prespecified patient subpopulations defined by race, \ngender, baseline LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels, age and diabetes status. \n \nIn a multicentre, double-blind, 24-week placebo-controlled study, patients taking Pelzont \n(2,000 mg/40 mg) with or without a statin, when compared to placebo, had significantly decreased \nLDL-C (-18.9 % vs. -0.5 %), TG (-21.7 % vs. 3.6 %), LDL-C:HDL-C (-28.9 % vs. 2.3 %), \nnon-HDL-C (-19.0 % vs. 0.8 %), apo B (-16.4 % vs. 2.5 %), TC (-9.2 % vs. -0.6 %), Lp(a) (-17.6 % \nvs. 1.1 %), and TC:HDL-C (-21.2 % vs. 1.9 %) and also had significantly increased HDL-C (18.8 % \nvs. -1.2 %), and apo A-I (11.2 % vs. 4.3 %) as measured by percent change from baseline. In general, \nthe between-group treatment effects on all lipid parameters were consistent across all patient \nsubgroups examined. Patients receiving Pelzont, nicotinic acid (prolonged-released formulation), or \nplacebo were also taking statins (29 % atorvastatin [5-80 mg], 54 % simvastatin [10-80 mg], 17 % \nother statins [2.5-180 mg] (pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin)), of which 9 % were also \ntaking ezetimibe [10 mg]. The effect on lipids was similar whether Pelzont was given as monotherapy \nor was added to ongoing statin therapy with or without ezetimibe.  \n \nThe placebo-adjusted LDL-C, HDL-C and TG responses appeared greater among women compared to \nmen and appeared greater among elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) compared to younger patients \n(< 65 years). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn a multicentre, double-blind, 12-week factorial study, Pelzont 1,000 mg/20 mg co-administered with \nsimvastatin, when compared with simvastatin alone or Pelzont 1,000 mg/20 mg alone, for 4 weeks, \nsignificantly lowered LDL-C (-44.2 %, -37.4 %, -8.2 % respectively), TG (-25.8 %, -15.7 %, -18.7 % \nrespectively), TC (-27.9 %, -25.8 %, -4.9 % respectively) and significantly increased HDL-C (19.2 %, \n4.2 %, 12.5 % respectively). Pelzont (2000 mg/40 mg) co-administered with simvastatin when \ncompared with simvastatin alone or Pelzont (2000 mg/40 mg) alone for 12 weeks, significantly \nlowered LDL-C (-47.9 %, -37.0 %, -17.0 % respectively), TG (-33.3 %, -14.7 %, -21.6 % \nrespectively), apo B (-41.0 %, -28.8 %, -17.1 % respectively), and TC (-29.6 %, -24.9 %, -9.1 % \nrespectively), as well as LDL-C:HDL-C (-57.1 %, -39.8 %, -31.2 % respectively), non-HDL-C \n(-45.8 %, -33.4 %, -18.1 % respectively), and TC:HDL-C (-43.0 %, -28.0 %, -24.9 % respectively), \nand significantly increased HDL-C (27.5 %, 6.0 %, 23.4 % respectively). Further analysis showed \nPelzont (2000 mg/40 mg) co-administered with simvastatin when compared with simvastatin alone \nsignificantly increased apo A-I (8.6 %, 2.3 % respectively) and significantly decreased Lp(a) (-19.8 %, \n0.0 % respectively ). Efficacy and safety of Pelzont in combination with simvastatin > 40 mg were not \nincluded in this study. \n \nFlushing \nIn three large clinical trials measuring patient-reported flushing symptoms, patients taking Pelzont \nexperienced less flushing than those taking nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulations). In patients \ncontinuing in the first study (24 weeks), the frequency of moderate or greater flushing in patients \ntreated with Pelzont declined and approached that of patients receiving placebo (see Figure 1), \nwhereas in patients treated with nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation) the flushing frequency \nremained constant (after Week 6).  \n \n\nFigure 1.

The oral bioavailability of nicotinic acid is not altered when it is taken with a high-fat meal. \n \nLaropiprant \nFollowing a 40 mg dose of laropiprant administered orally as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic \nacid/laropiprant with food, laropiprant is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1 hour, a mean \nAUC0-\u221e of approximately 13 \u03bcM\u00b7hr, and a mean Cmax of approximately 1.6 \u03bcM. The rate and extent of \nabsorption are not altered with a high-fat meal. The pharmacokinetics of laropiprant are linear, \ndisplaying approximately dose-proportional increases in AUC and Cmax and no evidence of \ntime-dependent clearance. \n \nThe mean absolute bioavailability of laropiprant is approximately 71 % following a 40 mg dose when \nadministered as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic acid/laropiprant after an overnight fast. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nDistribution \nNicotinic acid \nNicotinic acid is less than 20 % bound to serum proteins. \n \nLaropiprant \nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 40 mg intravenous dose of \nlaropiprant to healthy subjects is approximately 70 litres. Laropiprant is highly bound (> 99 %) to \nplasma proteins, and its binding is independent of concentration. Laropiprant crosses the placenta in \nrats and rabbits. \n \nBiotransformation \nNicotinic acid \nNicotinic acid undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism through two pathways that are dose and \ndose-rate dependent. The first pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide \n(NAD) and nicotinamide. In humans, nicotinamide is further predominantly metabolised to \nN-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and to N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY). In the second \npathway, glycine is conjugated with nicotinic acid to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). With low doses of \nnicotinic acid or lower rates of absorption, the first pathway predominates. At higher doses or higher \nrates of absorption, the NAD pathway is saturable, and an increasing fraction of the oral dose reaches \nthe bloodstream unchanged as nicotinic acid. The glycine conjugation pathway is not saturated across \nthe clinically relevant dose range, based on the dose-proportional increase in the plasma \nconcentrations of NUA from 1,000 mg to 2,000 mg.  \n \nIn in vitro studies, nicotinic acid and its metabolites did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4-mediated reactions or UGT1A1-mediated \n3-glucuronidation of estradiol. \n \nLaropiprant \nLaropiprant is metabolised primarily via acyl glucuronidation, with a smaller component of oxidative \nmetabolism, followed by excretion of the glucuronide into faeces (via bile) and urine. Laropiprant and \nits acyl glucuronide conjugate are the major circulating components in human plasma. In vitro studies \nhave shown that the acyl glucuronide conjugate of laropiprant had at least a 65-fold reduced affinity \nfor DP1 as compared to laropiprant; thus, it is not expected to contribute to the overall DP1 activity of \nlaropiprant. The major component (73 % of radioactivity) in faeces is laropiprant (comprising \nunabsorbed active substance and/or hydrolysed glucuronic acid conjugate). In urine, the primary \ncomponent is the acyl glucuronide conjugate (64 % of radioactivity) with smaller contributions from \nthe parent compound (5 %). The oxidative metabolism of laropiprant is catalysed primarily by \nCYP3A4, whereas several UGT isoforms (1A1, 1A3, 1A9 and 2B7) catalysed the acyl \nglucuronidation. \n \nElimination \nNicotinic acid \nNicotinic acid is predominantly excreted in the urine as metabolites. \n \nLaropiprant \nLaropiprant is eliminated primarily via acyl glucuronidation, followed by excretion of the glucuronide \nin faeces (via bile) and urine. Following oral administration of 14C-laropiprant in humans, \napproximately 68 % of the dose was recovered in faeces (primarily as parent compound, comprising \nunabsorbed active substance and/or hydrolysed glucuronic acid conjugate) and 22 % was recovered in \nurine (primarily as metabolites). The majority of the dose was excreted within 96 hours. The apparent \nterminal half-life (t1/2) following a 40 mg dose of laropiprant administered as two modified-release \ntablets of nicotinic acid/laropiprant with food was approximately 17 hours. Pharmacokinetic steady \nstate is achieved within 2 days of once-daily dosing of laropiprant, with minimal accumulation in \nAUC (approximately 1.3-fold) and Cmax (approximately 1.1-fold). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nCharacteristics in patients \nRenal insufficiency \nPelzont: Use in patients with renal insufficiency has not been studied. \n \nNicotinic acid: see section 4.4. \n \nLaropiprant: Administration of laropiprant 40 mg in non-dialysed patients with severe renal \ninsufficiency resulted in no clinically meaningful change in the AUC and Cmax of laropiprant, \ncompared to healthy control subjects. As no effect was observed in severe renal insufficiency, no \neffect is expected in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiency; however, the effects of \nend-stage renal failure and dialysis on laropiprant pharmacokinetics cannot be inferred from this study. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nPelzont: Use in patients with hepatic insufficiency has not been studied. \n \nNicotinic acid: see sections 4.3 and 4.4. \n \nLaropiprant: Consistent with the characteristics of a medicinal product that is primarily cleared by \nmetabolism, moderate hepatic disease has a significant impact on laropiprant pharmacokinetics, with \nan increase in AUC and Cmax of approximately 2.8- and 2.2-fold respectively. \n \nGender \nNicotinic acid: No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender has no clinically meaningful \neffect on pharmacokinetics of nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation). There is no difference in \nthe oral bioavailability of nicotinic acid in men and women receiving Pelzont. Women have a modest \nincrease in plasma concentrations of nicotinuric acid and nicotinic acid compared to men. \n \nLaropiprant: No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically meaningful \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant. \n \nElderly \nNicotinic acid: There is no pharmacokinetic data in the elderly (\u2265 65 years). Age has no clinically \nmeaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation) based on a \ncomposite analysis of subjects ages 18-65 years. There is no change in the oral bioavailability of \nnicotinic acid with age. \n \nLaropiprant: No dose adjustment is necessary in the elderly. Age had no clinically meaningful effect \non the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant. \n \nPaediatric population \nPelzont: No studies have been performed in paediatric patients. \n \nRace \nNicotinic acid: No dose adjustment is necessary based on race. Race has no clinically meaningful \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation) based on \npharmacokinetic data including subjects of Hispanic, White, Black, and Native American racial \ngroups. Caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with Pelzont co-administered with \nsimvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin (particularly simvastatin doses of 40 mg or higher). (See \nsection 4.4). \n \nLaropiprant: No dose adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no clinically meaningful effect \non the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant based on a composite analysis of pharmacokinetic data \nincluding subjects of White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and Native American racial groups. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPelzont \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to human use.  \n \nThe safety of concomitant administration of nicotinic acid and laropiprant was assessed in dogs and \nrats. Toxicologic findings in these co-administration studies were consistent with those seen with \nnicotinic acid and laropiprant administered individually. \n \nNicotinic acid \nDegeneration in the stomach and hepatocyte vacuolation were observed in rats following 6 months of \ndosing at systemic exposure values at least 179 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the \nrecommended daily human dose. Retinopathy and/or corneal lesions were observed in dogs following \n6 months of dosing at systemic exposure values at least 240 times the human exposure based on the \nAUC of the recommended daily human dose. \n \nNicotinic acid was not carcinogenic in mice when administered for the duration of their life. Mice in \nthis study received approximately 9 to 13 times a human nicotinic acid dose of 2,000 mg/day as \ndetermined on a mg/m2 basis. Nicotinic acid showed no mutagenic effects in the in vitro assays. \n \nNo nicotinic acid-related adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats up to \nexposure levels approximately 391 times the human AUC of nicotinic acid based on the AUC of the \nrecommended daily human dose. \n \nNicotinic acid was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits up to exposure levels approximately 253 and \n104 times the human AUC of nicotinic acid at the recommended daily human dose, respectively. In \nrats, foetotoxic effects (significantly decreased foetal body weights associated with a decrease in the \nnumber of ossified sacrocaudal vertebrae and an increased incidence of foetuses with sites of \nincomplete ossification) were noted in the absence of any signs of maternal toxicity at exposure levels \napproximately 959 times the human AUC of nicotinic acid at the recommended daily human dose. \nSimilar treatment-related changes were observed in rabbit foetuses but in the presence of maternal \ntoxicity at exposure levels approximately 629 times the human AUC of nicotinic acid at the \nrecommended daily human dose. \n \nLaropiprant \nKetonuria and hepatocellular centrilobular hypertrophy were observed in rats in repeated dose toxicity \nstudies for up to 6 months dosing. The hepatocellular centrilobular hypertrophy was consistent with \nrodent specific enzyme induction. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was at least \n118 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily human dose. \n \nIncreases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were observed in all dog studies, at systemic \nexposure levels at least 14 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily \nhuman dose. No other effects were observed in dog studies with exposures at least 100 times the \nhuman exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily human dose. \n \nLaropiprant was not carcinogenic in 2 year studies in mice and rats at the highest doses tested, which \nrepresents at least 218 to 289 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily \nhuman dose. \n \nLaropiprant was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of genetic toxicology studies. \n \nNo adverse effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats given laropiprant prior to mating \nand throughout mating, at systemic exposure levels at least 289 times the human exposure based on \nthe AUC of the recommended daily human dose.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nLaropiprant was not teratogenic in rats or in rabbits at systemic exposure levels at least 153 and \n438 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily human dose. \nReproduction toxicity studies showed slight treatment-related decreases in mean maternal weight gain \nand foetal body weight, slight increases in pup mortality, and increased incidence of supernumerary \nrib and incomplete ossification of the sternebra in the foetus were observed in rats at systemic \nexposure levels at least 513 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily \nhuman dose. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Pelzont is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Pelzont \n3. How to take Pelzont \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pelzont  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pelzont is and what it is used for \n \nThe name of your medicine is Pelzont. It contains two different active substances:  \n\u2022 nicotinic acid, a lipid modifying medicine, and  \n\u2022 laropiprant, which reduces symptoms of flushing, a common side effect of nicotinic acid. \n \nHow Pelzont Works \nPelzont is used in addition to diet \n\u2022 to lower your \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol level. It does this by lowering the levels of total cholesterol, \n\nLDL cholesterol, fatty substances called triglycerides and apo B (a part of LDL) in the blood;  \n\u2022 to raise levels of \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) and apo A-I (a part of HDL).  \n \nWhat should I know about cholesterol and triglycerides? \nCholesterol is one of several fats found in your blood. Your total cholesterol is made up mainly of \n\u2018bad\u2019 (LDL) and \u2018good\u2019 (HDL) cholesterol. \n \nLDL cholesterol is often called \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries \nand form plaque. Over time, this plaque build-up can lead to a clogging of your arteries. This clogging \ncan slow or block blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain. When the blood flow is \nblocked, the result can be a heart attack or stroke. \n \nHDL cholesterol is often called \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol because it helps keep the \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol from \nbuilding up in the arteries and because it protects against heart disease. \n \nTriglycerides are another fat in your blood. They may raise your risk of having heart problems. \n \nIn most people, at first there are no signs of cholesterol problems. Your doctor can measure your \ncholesterol with a simple blood test. Visit your doctor regularly to keep track of your cholesterol and \ndiscuss your goals with your doctor. \n \nPelzont is used in addition to diet and exercise in adult patients with primary \nhypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia: \n\u2022 when you cannot control your cholesterol levels with a statin alone (class of cholesterol-lowering \n\nmedicines working in the liver); \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\n\u2022 when you cannot tolerate a statin or when a statin is not recommended for you. \n \nPatients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia have high blood levels of \u2018bad\u2019 LDL cholesterol and \ntriglycerides (a type of fat), and low levels of \u2018good\u2019 HDL cholesterol. Primary hypercholesterolaemia \nis when the levels of cholesterol in the blood are high. Primary means that the hypercholesterolaemia \ndoes not have any identifiable cause. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Pelzont \n \nDo not take Pelzont if \n\u2022 you are allergic to nicotinic acid, to laropiprant, or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 you currently have liver problems. \n\u2022 you have an ulcer in your stomach. \n\u2022 you have arterial bleeding. \n \nDo not take Pelzont if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Pelzont. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions.

It is not known if Pelzont will harm your unborn \n\nbaby. \n\u2022 You are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. It is not known if Pelzont will pass into your \n\nbreast milk. However, nicotinic acid a component of Pelzont does pass into breast milk. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will decide if \nPelzont is right for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people get dizzy after taking Pelzont.

In order for your medicine to work as intended, do not split, break, \n\ncrush, or chew the tablet before you swallow it. \n\u2022 Avoid drinking alcohol or hot drinks or eating spicy foods near the time you take your dose of \n\nPelzont. This will lower your chance of flushing (redness of the skin, feeling warm, itching, or \ntingling, particularly in your head, neck, chest and upper back). \n\n\u2022 Taking aspirin before you take Pelzont does not reduce your flushing more than taking Pelzont \nalone. Therefore, taking aspirin to reduce flushing symptoms is not necessary.

Continue with your usual dose the next evening or \n\nat bedtime. However, if you do not take Pelzont for 7 or more days in a row, talk to your doctor \nbefore restarting Pelzont. \n\n \nIf you stop taking Pelzont \nDo not stop taking Pelzont without talking to your doctor. Your cholesterol problem may return. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what pelzont is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "the name of your medicine is pelzont. it contains two different active substances: nicotinic acid, a lipid modifying medicine, and laropiprant, which reduces symptoms of flushing, a common side effect of nicotinic acid. how pelzont works pelzont is used in addition to diet to lower your 'bad' cholesterol level. it does this by lowering the levels of total cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, fatty substances called triglycerides and apo b (a part of ldl) in the blood; to raise levels of 'good' cholesterol (hdl cholesterol) and apo a-i (a part of hdl). what should i know about cholesterol and triglycerides? cholesterol is one of several fats found in your blood. your total cholesterol is made up mainly of 'bad' (ldl) and 'good' (hdl) cholesterol. ldl cholesterol is often called 'bad' cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries and form plaque. over time, this plaque build-up can lead to a clogging of your arteries. this clogging can slow or block blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain. when the blood flow is blocked, the result can be a heart attack or stroke. hdl cholesterol is often called 'good' cholesterol because it helps keep the 'bad' cholesterol from building up in the arteries and because it protects against heart disease. triglycerides are another fat in your blood. they may raise your risk of having heart problems. in most people, at first there are no signs of cholesterol problems. your doctor can measure your cholesterol with a simple blood test. visit your doctor regularly to keep track of your cholesterol and discuss your goals with your doctor. pelzont is used in addition to diet and exercise in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia: when you cannot control your cholesterol levels with a statin alone (class of cholesterol-lowering medicines working in the liver); 31 when you cannot tolerate a statin or when a statin is not recommended for you. patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia have high blood levels of 'bad' ldl cholesterol and triglycerides (a type of fat), and low levels of 'good' hdl cholesterol. primary hypercholesterolaemia is when the levels of cholesterol in the blood are high. primary means that the hypercholesterolaemia does not have any identifiable cause.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pelzont", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 9, "BeginOffset": 83, "EndOffset": 97, "Score": 0.579922616481781,

your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. how much to take you should start by taking one tablet a day. after 4 weeks, your doctor may raise your dose to two tablets a day. if you are switching from a medicine containing 2,000 mg or more of a prolonged-release nicotinic acid, your doctor can start you with two tablets of pelzont a day. if you are switching from a medicine with less than 2,000 mg of prolonged-nicotinic acid, you should start by taking one tablet of pelzont a day. after 4 weeks, your doctor may raise your dose of pelzont to two 33 tablets a day. how to take take pelzont once a day, in the evening or at bedtime. take pelzont with food. swallow each tablet whole. in order for your medicine to work as intended, do not split, break, crush, or chew the tablet before you swallow it. avoid drinking alcohol or hot drinks or eating spicy foods near the time you take your dose of pelzont. this will lower your chance of flushing (redness of the skin, feeling warm, itching, or tingling, particularly in your head, neck, chest and upper back). taking aspirin before you take pelzont does not reduce your flushing more than taking pelzont alone. therefore, taking aspirin to reduce flushing symptoms is not necessary. if you take aspirin for any other reason, continue to follow your doctor's advice. if you take more pelzont than you should in the event of an overdose, the following side effects were reported: flushing, headache, pruritus (itching), nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain/discomfort, and back pain. if you take more than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. if you forget to take pelzont if you miss a dose, do not take an extra dose. continue with your usual dose the next evening or at bedtime. however, if you do not take pelzont for 7 or more days in a row, talk to your doctor before restarting pelzont. if you stop taking pelzont do not stop taking pelzont without talking to your doctor. your cholesterol problem may return. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pelzont", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
