PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules for oral suspension.  \nWhite granules.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric, kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients.  \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult and paediatric patients.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nThis medicinal product should only be prescribed, and changes in immunosuppressive therapy \ninitiated, by physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and the management of transplant \npatients. Modigraf is a granular formulation of tacrolimus, for twice-a-day administration. Modigraf \ntherapy requires careful monitoring by adequately qualified and equipped personnel. \n \nPosology  \nThe recommended initial doses presented below are intended to act solely as a guideline. Modigraf is \nroutinely administered in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents in the initial \npost-operative period. The dose may vary depending upon the immunosuppressive regimen chosen. \nModigraf dosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \npatient individually aided by blood level monitoring (see below under \u201cTherapeutic drug \nmonitoring\u201d). If clinical signs of rejection are apparent, alteration of the immunosuppressive regimen \nshould be considered.  \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nCareful and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels is recommended in the first 2 weeks \npost-transplant to ensure adequate exposure to the active substance in the immediate post-transplant \nperiod. As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, it may take several days after adjustments to \nthe Modigraf dose regimen before steady state is achieved (see below under \u201cTherapeutic drug \nmonitoring\u201d and section 5.2).  \n \nModigraf should not be switched with the prolonged-release capsules (Advagraf) as a clinically \nrelevant difference in bioavailability between the two formulations cannot be excluded. In general, \ninadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised switching of immediate- or prolonged-release formulations \nof tacrolimus is unsafe. This can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of undesirable effects, \nincluding under- or overimmunosuppression, due to clinically relevant differences in systemic \nexposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the \ncorresponding dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place under the \nclose supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Following conversion to any \nalternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring must be performed and dose adjustments made to \nensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus is maintained.  \n \nProphylaxis of kidney transplant rejection  \nAdults  \nOral Modigraf therapy should commence at 0.20 - 0.30 mg/kg/day administered as 2 divided doses \n(e.g. morning and evening). Administration should commence within 24 hours after the completion of \nsurgery.  \nIf the dose cannot be administered orally as a result of the clinical condition of the patient, intravenous \ntherapy of 0.05 - 0.10 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) should \nbe initiated as a continuous 24-hour infusion.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nAn initial oral dose of 0.30 mg/kg/day should be administered in 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and \nevening). If the clinical condition of the patient prevents oral dosing, an initial intravenous dose of \n0.075 \u2013 0.100 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) should be \nadministered as a continuous 24-hour infusion.  \n \nDose adjustment during post-transplant period in adults and paediatric patients  \nTacrolimus doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to \nwithdraw concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to tacrolimus-based dual therapy. \nPost-transplant improvement in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of \ntacrolimus and may necessitate further dose adjustments.  \n \nProphylaxis of liver transplant rejection  \nAdults  \nOral Modigraf therapy should commence at 0.10 - 0.20 mg/kg/day administered as 2 divided doses \n(e.g. morning and evening). Administration should commence approximately 12 hours after the \ncompletion of surgery.  \nIf the dose cannot be administered orally as a result of the clinical condition of the patient, intravenous \ntherapy of 0.01 - 0.05 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) should \nbe initiated as a continuous 24-hour infusion.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nAn initial oral dose of 0.30 mg/kg/day should be administered in 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and \nevening). If the clinical condition of the patient prevents oral dosing, an initial intravenous dose of \n0.05 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) should be administered as \na continuous 24-hour infusion.  \n \nDose adjustment during post-transplant period in adults and paediatric patients  \nTacrolimus doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to \nwithdraw concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to tacrolimus monotherapy. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nPost-transplant improvement in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of \ntacrolimus and may necessitate further dose adjustments.  \n \nProphylaxis of heart transplant rejection  \nAdults  \nModigraf can be used with antibody induction (allowing for delayed start of tacrolimus therapy) or \nalternatively in clinically stable patients without antibody induction.  \nFollowing antibody induction, oral Modigraf therapy should commence at a dose of 0.075 mg/kg/day \nadministered as 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and evening). Administration should commence within \n5 days after the completion of surgery as soon as the patient's clinical condition is stabilised. If the \ndose cannot be administered orally as a result of the clinical condition of the patient, intravenous \ntherapy of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) should \nbe initiated as a continuous 24-hour infusion.  \nAn alternative strategy was published where oral tacrolimus was administered within 12 hours post \ntransplantation. This approach was reserved for patients without organ dysfunction (e.g. renal \ndysfunction). In that case, an initial oral tacrolimus dose of 2 to 4 mg per day was used in combination \nwith mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or in combination with sirolimus and corticosteroids.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nTacrolimus has been used with or without antibody induction in paediatric heart transplantation.  \nIn patients without antibody induction, if tacrolimus therapy is initiated intravenously, the \nrecommended starting dose is 0.03 - 0.05 mg/kg/day (with Prograf 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution \nfor infusion) as a continuous 24-hour infusion targeted to achieve tacrolimus whole blood \nconcentrations of 15 - 25 nanogram/ml. Patients should be converted to oral therapy as soon as \nclinically practicable. The first dose of oral therapy should be 0.30 mg/kg/day starting 8 to 12 hours \nafter discontinuing intravenous therapy.  \nFollowing antibody induction, if Modigraf therapy is initiated orally, the recommended starting dose is \n0.10 - 0.30 mg/kg/day administered as 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and evening).  \n \nDose adjustment during post-transplant period in adults and paediatric patients  \nTacrolimus doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. Post-transplant improvement in the \ncondition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may necessitate further dose \nadjustments.  \n \nConversion between Modigraf and Prograf tacrolimus formulations  \nIn healthy subjects the systemic exposure to tacrolimus (AUC) for Modigraf was approximately 18% \nhigher than that for Prograf capsules when administered as single doses. There are no safety data \navailable on the use of Modigraf granules following a temporary switch from Prograf or Advagraf in \ncritically ill patients.  \n \nStable allograft recipients maintained on Modigraf granules, requiring conversion to Prograf capsules, \nshould be converted on a 1:1 mg:mg total daily dose basis. If equal doses are not possible, the total \ndaily dose of Prograf should be rounded-up to the nearest amount possible, with the higher dose given \nin the morning and the lower dose in the evening.  \n \nSimilarly, for conversion of patients from Prograf capsules to Modigraf granules, the total daily \nModigraf dose should preferably be equal to the total daily Prograf dose. If conversion on the basis of \nequal quantities is not possible, the total daily dose of Modigraf should be rounded down to the nearest \ntotal daily dose possible with sachets 0.2 mg and 1 mg.  \nThe total daily dose of Modigraf granules should be administered in 2 equal doses. If equal doses are \nnot possible, then the higher dose should be administered in the morning and the lower dose in the \nevening. Modigraf sachets must not be used partially.  \n \nExample: Total daily dose Prograf capsules given as 1 mg in the morning and 0.5 mg in the evening. \nThen give a total daily dose of Modigraf 1.4 mg divided as 0.8 mg in the morning and 0.6 mg in the \nevening.  \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nTacrolimus trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and within 1 week after conversion. \nDose adjustments should be made to ensure that similar systemic exposure is maintained.  \n \nConversion from ciclosporin to tacrolimus  \nCare should be taken when converting patients from ciclosporin-based to tacrolimus-based therapy \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus is not \nrecommended. Tacrolimus therapy should be initiated after considering ciclosporin blood \nconcentrations and the clinical condition of the patient. Dosing should be delayed in the presence of \nelevated ciclosporin blood levels. In practice, tacrolimus-based therapy has been initiated \n12 - 24 hours after discontinuation of ciclosporin. Monitoring of ciclosporin blood levels should be \ncontinued following conversion as the clearance of ciclosporin might be affected.  \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection  \nIncreased tacrolimus doses, supplemental corticosteroid therapy, and introduction of short courses of \nmono-/polyclonal antibodies have all been used to manage rejection episodes. If signs of toxicity such \nas severe adverse reactions are noted (see section 4.8), the dose of Modigraf may need to be reduced. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after kidney or liver transplantation \u2013 adults and paediatric patients \nFor conversion from other immunosuppressants to twice daily Modigraf, treatment should begin with \nthe initial oral dose recommended for primary immunosuppression.  \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after heart transplantation therapy \u2013 adults and paediatric patients \nIn adult patients converted to Modigraf, an initial oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day should be administered \nin 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and evening).  \nIn paediatric patients converted to tacrolimus, an initial oral dose of 0.20 - 0.30 mg/kg/day should be \nadministered in 2 divided doses (e.g. morning and evening).  \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after transplantation of other allografts  \nThe dose recommendations for lung, pancreas and intestinal transplantation are based on limited \nprospective clinical trial data with the Prograf formulation. Prograf has been used in lung-transplanted \npatients at an initial oral dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg/kg/day, in pancreas-transplanted patients at an initial \noral dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day and in intestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day. \n \nTherapeutic drug monitoring  \nDosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \nindividual patient aided by whole blood tacrolimus trough level monitoring.  \n \nAs an aid to optimise dosing, several immunoassays are available for determining tacrolimus \nconcentrations in whole blood. Comparisons of concentrations from the published literature to \nindividual values in clinical practice should be assessed with care and knowledge of the assay methods \nemployed. In current clinical practice, whole blood levels are monitored using immunoassay methods. \nThe relationship between tacrolimus trough levels (C12) and systemic exposure (AUC0-12) is similar \nbetween the 2 formulations Modigraf granules and Prograf capsules.  \n \nBlood trough levels of tacrolimus should be monitored during the post-transplantation period. \nTacrolimus blood trough levels should be determined approximately 12 hours post-dosing of Modigraf \ngranules, just prior to the next dose. Frequent trough level monitoring in the initial 2 weeks post \ntransplantation is recommended, followed by periodic monitoring during maintenance therapy. Blood \ntrough levels should be monitored at least twice weekly during the early post-transplant period and \nthen periodically during maintenance therapy. Blood trough levels of tacrolimus should also be closely \nmonitored when clinical signs of toxicity or acute rejection are observed, following conversion \nbetween Modigraf granules to Prograf capsules, dose adjustments, changes in the immunosuppressive \nregimen, or co-administration of substances which may alter tacrolimus whole blood concentrations \n(see section 4.5). The frequency of blood level monitoring should be based on clinical needs. As \ntacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, it may take several days after adjustments to the \nModigraf dose regimen before the targeted steady state is achieved (see section 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nData from clinical studies suggests that the majority of patients can be successfully managed if \ntacrolimus blood trough levels are maintained below 20 nanogram/ml. It is necessary to consider the \nclinical condition of the patient when interpreting whole blood levels. In clinical practice, whole blood \ntrough levels have generally been in the range 5 - 20 nanogram/ml in liver transplant recipients and \n10 - 20 nanogram/ml in kidney and heart transplant patients in the early post-transplant period. During \nsubsequent maintenance therapy, blood concentrations have generally been in the range of \n5 - 15 nanogram/ml in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients. \n \nSpecial populations  \nHepatic impairment  \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the \nblood trough levels within the recommended target range.  \n \nRenal impairment  \nAs the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are unaffected by renal function (see section 5.2), no dose \nadjustment is required. However, owing to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus careful monitoring \nof renal function is recommended (including serial serum creatinine concentrations, calculation of \ncreatinine clearance and monitoring of urine output).  \n \nRace  \nIn comparison to Caucasians, black patients may require higher tacrolimus doses to achieve similar \ntrough levels.  \n \nGender  \nThere is no evidence that male and female patients require different doses to achieve similar trough \nlevels.  \n \nElderly patients  \nThere is no evidence currently available to indicate that dosing should be adjusted in older people. \n  \nPaediatric population  \nIn general, paediatric patients require doses 1\u00bd - 2 times higher than the adult doses to achieve similar \nblood levels.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nTacrolimus therapy is generally initiated by the oral route. If necessary, tacrolimus dosing may \ncommence by administering Modigraf granules suspended in water, via nasogastric tubing.  \n \nIt is recommended that the oral daily dose of Modigraf be administered in 2 divided doses (e.g. \nmorning and evening).  \n \nModigraf granules should generally be administered on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or \n2 to 3 hours after a meal, to achieve maximal absorption (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe required dose is calculated from the weight of the patient, using the minimum number of sachets \npossible. 2 ml of water (at room temperature) should be used per 1 mg tacrolimus to produce a \nsuspension (up to a maximum of 50 ml, depending on body weight) in a cup. Materials containing \npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) should not be used (see section 6.2). Granules are added to the water and \nstirred. It is not advised to use any liquids or utensils to empty the sachets. The suspension can be \ndrawn up via a syringe or swallowed directly by the patient. Thereafter the cup is rinsed once with the \nsame quantity of water and the rinsings consumed by the patient. The suspension should be \nadministered immediately after preparation.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to tacrolimus or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nHypersensitivity to other macrolides.  \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThere are no safety data available on the use of Modigraf granules following a temporary switch from \nPrograf or Advagraf in critically ill patients.  \n \nModigraf should not be switched with Advagraf as a clinically relevant difference in bioavailability \nbetween the two formulations cannot be excluded. Medication errors, including inadvertent, \nunintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or prolonged-release tacrolimus \nformulations, have been observed. This has led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, \nor other adverse reactions which could be a consequence of either under- or over-exposure to \ntacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the \ncorresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulations or regimen should only take place \nunder the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  \n \nDuring the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken \non a routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, \nelectrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, \ncoagulation values, and plasma protein determinations. If clinically relevant changes are seen, \nadjustments of the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered.  \n \nWhen substances with a potential for interaction (see section 4.5) \u2013 particularly strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (such as telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, \ntelithromycin or clarithromycin) or inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin) \u2013 are being \ncombined with tacrolimus, tacrolimus blood levels should be monitored to adjust the tacrolimus dose \nas appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure.  \n \nHerbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal preparations \nshould be avoided when taking Modigraf due to the risk of interactions that lead to either a decrease in \nblood concentrations of tacrolimus and reduced clinical effect of tacrolimus, or an increase in blood \nconcentrations of tacrolimus and risk of tacrolimus toxicity (see section 4.5).  \n \nThe combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be avoided and care should be \ntaken when administering tacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5).  \n \nHigh potassium intake or potassium-sparing diuretics should be avoided (see section 4.5).  \n \nCertain combinations of tacrolimus with drugs known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects may \nincrease the risks of these effects (see section 4.5).  \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided.  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. As gastrointestinal \nperforation is a medically important event that may lead to a life-threatening or serious condition, \nadequate treatments should be considered immediately after suspected symptoms or signs occur. \n \nSince levels of tacrolimus in blood may significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, extra \nmonitoring of tacrolimus concentrations is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea. \n \nCardiac disorders  \nVentricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the septum, reported as cardiomyopathies, have been \nobserved on rare occasions. Most cases have been reversible, occurring with tacrolimus blood trough \nconcentrations much higher than the recommended maximum levels. Other factors observed to \nincrease the risk of these clinical conditions included pre-existing heart disease, corticosteroid usage, \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nhypertension, renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid overload, and oedema. Accordingly, \nhigh-risk patients, particularly young children and those receiving substantial immunosuppression \nshould be monitored, using such procedures as echocardiography or ECG pre- and post-transplant (e.g. \ninitially at 3 months and then at 9-12 months). If abnormalities develop, dose reduction of Modigraf, \nor change of treatment to another immunosuppressive agent should be considered. Tacrolimus may \nprolong the QT interval and may cause Torsades de Pointes. Caution should be exercised in patients \nwith risk factors for QT prolongation, including patients with a personal or family history of QT \nprolongation, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias and electrolyte abnormalities. Caution should \nalso be exercised in patients diagnosed or suspected to have Congenital Long QT Syndrome or \nacquired QT prolongation or patients on concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, \ninduce electrolyte abnormalities or known to increase tacrolimus exposure (see section 4.5).   \n \nLymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies  \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated \nlymphoproliferative disorders (see section 4.8). A combination of immunosuppressives such as \nantilymphocytic antibodies (e.g. basiliximab, daclizumab) given concomitantly increases the risk of \nEBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-negative patients \nhave been reported to have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, \nin this patient group, EBV-VCA serology should be ascertained before starting treatment with \nModigraf. During treatment, careful monitoring with EBV-PCR is recommended. Positive EBV-PCR \nmay persist for months and is per se not indicative of lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma.  \n \nAs with other potent immunosuppressive compounds, the risk of secondary cancer is unknown (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nAs with other immunosuppressive agents, owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes, \nexposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a \nsunscreen with a high protection factor.  \n \nInfections including opportunistic infections  \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including Modigraf, are at increased risk for infections \nincluding opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal) such as BK virus associated \nnephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients are \nalso at an increased risk of infections with viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and C reactivation \nand de novo infection, as well as hepatitis E, which may become chronic). These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating hepatic or renal function or neurological symptoms. Prevention and management should \nbe in accordance with appropriate clinical guidance. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome (PRES). If patients taking tacrolimus present with symptoms indicating PRES such as \nheadache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances, a radiological procedure (e.g. MRI) \nshould be performed. If PRES is diagnosed, adequate blood pressure and seizure control and \nimmediate discontinuation of systemic tacrolimus is advised. Most patients completely recover after \nappropriate measures are taken.  \n \nEye disorders \nEye disorders, sometimes progressing to loss of vision, have been reported in patients treated with \ntacrolimus. Some cases have reported resolution on switching to alternative immunosuppression. \nPatients should be advised to report changes in visual acuity, changes in colour vision, blurred vision, \nor visual field defect, and in such cases, prompt evaluation is recommended with referral to an \nophthalmologist as appropriate. \n \nPure Red Cell Aplasia \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All \npatients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease or \nconcomitant medications associated with PRCA. \n \nSpecial populations  \nThere is limited experience in non-Caucasian patients and patients at elevated immunological risk (e.g. \nretransplantation, evidence of panel reactive antibodies, PRA).  \n \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment (See section 4.2).  \n \nExcipients \nModigraf granules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised by hepatic CYP3A4. There is also evidence of \ngastrointestinal metabolism by CYP3A4 in the intestinal wall. Concomitant use of substances known \nto inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby increase or \ndecrease tacrolimus blood levels.  \n \nIt is strongly recommended to closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, as well as, QT prolongation \n(with ECG), renal function and other side effects, whenever substances which have the potential to \nalter CYP3A4 metabolism or otherwise influence tacrolimus blood levels are used concomitantly, and \nto interrupt or adjust the tacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus \nexposure (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels  \nClinically the following substances have been shown to increase tacrolimus blood levels:  \nStrong interactions have been observed with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, \nand the combination of ombitasvir and paritaprevir with ritonavir, when used with and without \ndasabuvir), or the CMV antiviral letermovir, the pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat, and the tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors nilotinib and imatinib. Concomitant use of these substances may require decreased \ntacrolimus doses in nearly all patients.  \nPharmacokinetics studies have indicated that the increase in blood levels is mainly a result of increase \nin oral bioavailability of tacrolimus owing to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism. Effect on \nhepatic clearance is less pronounced. \nWeaker interactions have been observed with clotrimazole, clarithromycin, josamycin, nifedipine, \nnicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, danazol, ethinylestradiol, omeprazole, nefazodone and \n(Chinese) herbal remedies containing extracts of Schisandra sphenanthera.  \nIn vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: \nbromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, \nmidazolam, nilvadipine, norethisterone, quinidine, tamoxifen, troleandomycin.  \nGrapefruit juice has been reported to increase the blood level of tacrolimus and should therefore be \navoided.  \nLansoprazole and ciclosporin may potentially inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tacrolimus and \nthereby increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations.  \n \nOther interactions potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels  \nTacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Possible interactions with other medicinal \nproducts known to have high affinity for plasma proteins should be considered (e.g., NSAIDs, oral \nanticoagulants, or oral antidiabetics).  \nOther potential interactions that may increase systemic exposure of tacrolimus include prokinetic \nagents (such as metoclopramide and cisapride), cimetidine and magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide.  \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nCYP3A4 inducers potentially leading to decreased tacrolimus blood levels  \nClinically the following substances have been shown to decrease tacrolimus blood levels:  \nStrong interactions have been observed with rifampicin, phenytoin or St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) which may require increased tacrolimus doses in almost all patients. Clinically significant \ninteractions have also been observed with phenobarbital. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids have \nbeen shown to reduce tacrolimus blood levels.  \n \nHigh dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone administered for the treatment of acute rejection have \nthe potential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels.  \nCarbamazepine, metamizole and isoniazid have the potential to decrease tacrolimus concentrations. \n \nEffect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal products  \nTacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor; thus concomitant use of tacrolimus with medicinal products \nknown to be metabolised by CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of such medicinal products.  \nThe half-life of ciclosporin is prolonged when tacrolimus is given concomitantly. In addition, \nsynergistic/additive nephrotoxic effects can occur. For these reasons, the combined administration of \nciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended and care should be taken when administering \ntacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \nTacrolimus has been shown to increase the blood level of phenytoin.  \nAs tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid-based contraceptives leading to increased hormone \nexposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures.  \nLimited knowledge of interactions between tacrolimus and statins is available. Clinical data suggest \nthat the pharmacokinetics of statins are largely unaltered by the co-administration of tacrolimus.  \nAnimal data have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearance and increase the \nhalf-life of pentobarbital and phenazone.  \n \nMycophenolic acid. Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from \nciclosporin, which interferes with enterohepatic recirculation of mycophenolic acid, to tacrolimus, \nwhich is devoid of this effect, as this might result in changes of mycophenolic acid exposure. Drugs \nwhich interfere with mycophenolic acid's enterohepatic cycle have potential to reduce the plasma level \nand efficacy of mycophenolic acid. Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid may be \nappropriate when switching from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa. \n\n \nOther interactions which have led to clinically detrimental effects \nConcurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic \neffects may increase these effects (e.g., aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, \nsulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, NSAIDs, ganciclovir or aciclovir). \nEnhanced nephrotoxicity has been observed following the administration of amphotericin B and \nibuprofen in conjunction with tacrolimus.  \n \nAs tacrolimus treatment may be associated with hyperkalaemia, or may increase pre-existing \nhyperkalaemia, high potassium intake, or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or \nspironolactone) should be avoided (see section 4.4).  \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nHuman data show that tacrolimus crosses the placenta. Limited data from organ transplant recipients \nshow no evidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions on the course and outcome of pregnancy \nunder tacrolimus treatment compared with other immunosuppressive medicinal products. However, \ncases of spontaneous abortion have been reported. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are \navailable. Tacrolimus treatment can be considered in pregnant women, when there is no safer \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nalternative and when the perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. In case of in utero \nexposure, monitoring of the newborn for the potential adverse events of tacrolimus is recommended \n(in particular effects on the kidneys).There is a risk for premature delivery (<37 week) (incidence of \n66 of 123 births, i.e. 53.7%; however, data showed that the majority of the newborns had normal birth \nweight for their gestational age) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn \n(incidence 8 of 111 neonates, i.e. 7.2%) which, however normalises spontaneously.  \nIn rats and rabbits, tacrolimus caused embryofoetal toxicity at doses which demonstrated maternal \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). Tacrolimus affected fertility in male rats (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nHuman data demonstrate that tacrolimus is excreted into breast milk. As detrimental effects on the \nnewborn cannot be excluded, women should not breast-feed whilst receiving tacrolimus.  \n \nFertility  \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTacrolimus may cause visual and neurological disturbances. This effect may be enhanced if tacrolimus \nis administered in association with alcohol.  \n \nNo studies on the effects of tacrolimus (Modigraf) on the ability to drive and use machines have been \nperformed.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reaction profile associated with immunosuppressive agents is often difficult to establish \nowing to the underlying disease and the concurrent use of multiple medicinal products. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in > 10% of patients) are tremor, renal \nimpairment, hyperglycaemic conditions, diabetes mellitus, hyperkalaemia, infections, hypertension \nand insomnia.  \n \nList of adverse reactions \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency groupingadverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nInfections and infestations  \nAs is well known for other potent immunosuppressive agents, patients receiving tacrolimus are \nfrequently at increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal). The course of \npre-existing infections may be aggravated. Both generalised and localised infections can occur.  \nCases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including Modigraf.  \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (inl. cysts and polyps)  \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of developing malignancies. \nBenign as well as malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and \nskin malignancies have been reported in association with tacrolimus treatment.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \ncommon: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, red blood cell analyses abnormal, \n\nleukocytosis  \n\n\n\n 12

\n \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications  \ncommon: primary graft dysfunction  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPain in extremity has been described in a number of published case reports as part of Calcineurin-\nInhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS). This typically presents as a bilateral and symmetrical, \nsevere, ascending pain in the lower extremities and may be associated with supra-therapeutic levels of \ntacrolimus. The syndrome may respond to tacrolimus dose reduction. In some cases, it was necessary \nto switch to alternative immunosuppression. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSeveral cases of accidental overdose have been reported with tacrolimus; symptoms have included \ntremor, headache, nausea and vomiting, infections, urticaria, lethargy and increases in blood urea \nnitrogen, serum creatinine concentrations and alanine aminotransferase levels.  \nNo specific antidote to tacrolimus therapy is available. If overdose occurs, general supportive \nmeasures and symptomatic treatment should be conducted.  \nBased on its high molecular weight, poor aqueous solubility, and extensive erythrocyte and plasma \nprotein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus will not be dialysable. In isolated patients with very \nhigh plasma levels, haemofiltration or -diafiltration have been effective in reducing toxic \nconcentrations. In cases of oral intoxication, gastric lavage and/or the use of adsorbents (such as \nactivated charcoal) may be helpful, if used shortly after intake.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AD02  \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects  \nAt the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus appear to be mediated by binding to a cytosolic \nprotein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of the compound. The \nFKBP12-tacrolimus complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, leading \nto a calcium-dependent inhibition of T-cell signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing \ntranscription of a discrete set of lymphokine genes. \nTacrolimus is a highly potent immunosuppressive agent and has proven activity in both in vitro and \nin vivo experiments.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 15 \n\nIn particular, tacrolimus inhibits the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which are mainly responsible \nfor graft rejection. Tacrolimus suppresses T-cell activation and T-helper-cell dependent B-cell \nproliferation, as well as the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukins-2, -3, and \u03b3-interferon) and \nthe expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety of tacrolimus administered twice daily in other primary organ \ntransplantation  \nIn prospective published studies oral tacrolimus (given as Prograf capsules) was investigated as \nprimary immunosuppressant in approximately 175 patients following lung, 475 patients following \npancreas and 630 patients following intestinal transplantation. Overall, the safety profile of oral \ntacrolimus in these published studies appeared to be similar to what was reported in the large studies, \nwhere tacrolimus was used as primary treatment in liver, kidney and heart transplantation. Efficacy \nresults of the largest studies in each indication are summarised below. \n \nLung transplantation  \nThe interim analysis of a recent multicentre study discussed 110 patients who underwent \n1:1 randomisation to either tacrolimus or ciclosporin. Tacrolimus was started as continuous \nintravenous infusion at a dose of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg/day and oral tacrolimus was administered at a \ndose of 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/day. A lower incidence of acute rejection episodes for tacrolimus- versus \nciclosporin-treated patients (11.5% versus 22.6%) and a lower incidence of chronic rejection, the \nbronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (2.86% versus 8.57%), was reported within the first year after \ntransplantation. The 1-year patient survival rate was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the \nciclosporin group. \n \nAnother randomised study included 66 patients on tacrolimus versus 67 patients on ciclosporin. \nTacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day and oral \ntacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments to target \ntrough levels of 10 to 20 nanogram/ml. The 1-year patient survival was 83% in the tacrolimus and \n71% in the ciclosporin group, the 2-year survival rates were 76% and 66%, respectively. Acute \nrejection episodes per 100 patient-days were numerically fewer in the tacrolimus (0.85 episodes) than \nin the ciclosporin group (1.09 episodes). Obliterative bronchiolitis developed in 21.7% of patients in \nthe tacrolimus group compared with 38.0% of patients in the ciclosporin group (p = 0.025). \nSignificantly more ciclosporin-treated patients (n = 13) required a switch to tacrolimus than \ntacrolimus-treated patients to ciclosporin (n = 2) (p = 0.02).  \n \nIn an additional 2-centre study, 26 patients were randomised to the tacrolimus versus 24 patients to the \nciclosporin group. Tacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of \n0.05 mg/kg/day and oral tacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/day with \nsubsequent dose adjustments to target trough levels of 12 to 15 nanogram/ml. The 1-year survival rates \nwere 73.1% in the tacrolimus versus 79.2% in the ciclosporin group. Freedom from acute rejection \nwas higher in the tacrolimus group at 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and at 1 year after lung \ntransplantation (50% versus 33.3%). \nThe 3 studies demonstrated similar survival rates. The incidences of acute rejection were numerically \nlower with tacrolimus in all 3 studies and one of the studies reported a significantly lower incidence of \nbronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with tacrolimus.  \n \nPancreas transplantation  \nA multicentre study included 205 patients undergoing simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation \nwho were randomised to tacrolimus (n = 103) or to ciclosporin (n = 102). The initial oral per protocol \ndose of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments to target trough levels of 8 to \n15 nanogram/ml by Day 5 and 5 to 10 nanogram/ml after Month 6. Pancreas survival at 1 year was \nsignificantly superior with tacrolimus: 91.3% versus 74.5% with ciclosporin (p < 0.0005), whereas \nrenal graft survival was similar in both groups. In total 34 patients switched treatment from ciclosporin \nto tacrolimus, whereas only 6 tacrolimus patients required alternative therapy.  \n \nIntestinal transplantation  \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nPublished clinical experience from a single centre on the use of oral tacrolimus for primary treatment \nfollowing intestinal transplantation showed that the actuarial survival rate of 155 patients (65 intestine \nalone, 75 liver and intestine, and 25 multivisceral) receiving tacrolimus and prednisone was 75% at \n1 year, 54% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years. In the early years the initial oral dose of tacrolimus was \n0.3 mg/kg/day. Results continuously improved with increasing experience over the course of 11 years. \nA variety of innovations, such as techniques for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV \ninfections, bone marrow augmentation, the adjunct use of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, \nlower initial tacrolimus doses with target trough levels of 10 to 15 nanogram/ml, and most recently \nallograft irradiation were considered to have contributed to improved results in this indication over \ntime. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nIn man, tacrolimus has been shown to be able to be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. \nAvailable tacrolimus is generally rapidly absorbed.  \nModigraf granules are an immediate-release formulation of tacrolimus for twice daily dosing. \nFollowing oral administration of Modigraf granules peak concentrations (Cmax) of tacrolimus in blood \nare on average achieved in approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. \nAbsorption of tacrolimus is variable. Results of a single dose bioequivalence study with adult healthy \nvolunteers showed that Modigraf granules were approximately 20% more bioavailable than the \nPrograf capsules. Mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (investigated with the Prograf capsules \nformulation) is in the range of 20 - 25% (individual range in adult patients 6 - 43%, in paediatric \nkidney transplant patients 3 - 77%). The oral bioavailability of tacrolimus was reduced when it was \nadministered after a meal.  \nBile flow does not influence the absorption of tacrolimus and therefore treatment with Modigraf \ngranules may commence orally.  \nIn some patients, tacrolimus appears to be continuously absorbed over a prolonged period yielding a \nrelatively flat absorption profile.  \n \nThe rate and extent of absorption of tacrolimus is greatest under fasted conditions. The presence of \nfood decreases both the rate and extent of absorption of tacrolimus, the effect being most pronounced \nafter a high-fat meal. The effect of a high-carbohydrate meal is less pronounced.  \nIn stable liver transplant patients, the oral bioavailability of tacrolimus was reduced when it was \nadministered after a meal of moderate fat (34% of calories) content. Decreases in AUC (27%) and \nCmax (50%), and an increase in tmax (173%) in whole blood were evident.  \nIn a study of stable renal transplant patients who were administered tacrolimus immediately after a \nstandard continental breakfast the effect on oral bioavailability was less pronounced. Decreases in \nAUC (2 to 12%) and Cmax (15 to 38%), and an increase in tmax (38 to 80%) in whole blood were \nevident.  \nA strong correlation exists between AUC and whole blood trough levels at steady-state for Modigraf. \nMonitoring of whole blood trough levels therefore provides a good estimate of systemic exposure.  \n \nDistribution  \nIn man, the disposition of tacrolimus after intravenous infusion may be described as biphasic.  \nIn the systemic circulation, tacrolimus binds strongly to erythrocytes resulting in an approximate 20:1 \ndistribution ratio of whole blood/plasma concentrations. In plasma, tacrolimus is highly bound \n(> 98.8%) to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein.  \nTacrolimus is extensively distributed in the body. The steady-state volume of distribution based on \nplasma concentrations is approximately 1300 l (healthy subjects). Corresponding data based on whole \nblood averaged 47.6 l.  \n \nMetabolism  \nTacrolimus is widely metabolised in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450-3A4. Tacrolimus is \nalso considerably metabolised in the intestinal wall. There are several metabolites identified. Only one \nof these has been shown in vitro to have immunosuppressive activity similar to that of tacrolimus. The \nother metabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive activity. In systemic circulation only one \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nof the inactive metabolites is present at low concentrations. Therefore, metabolites do not contribute to \npharmacological activity of tacrolimus.  \n \nExcretion  \nTacrolimus is a low-clearance substance. In healthy subjects, the average total body clearance \nestimated from whole blood concentrations was 2.25 l/h. In adult liver, kidney and heart transplant \npatients, values of 4.1 l/h, 6.7 l/h and 3.9 l/h, respectively, have been observed. Factors such as low \nhaematocrit and protein levels, which result in an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or \ncorticosteroid-induced increased metabolism, are considered to be responsible for the higher clearance \nrates observed following transplantation. \n \nThe half-life of tacrolimus is long and variable. In healthy subjects, the mean half-life in whole blood \nwas approximately 43 hours. In adult and paediatric liver transplant patients, it averaged 11.7 hours \nand 12.4 hours, respectively, compared with 15.6 hours in adult kidney transplant recipients. Increased \nclearance rates contribute to the shorter half-life observed in transplant recipients.  \n \nFollowing intravenous and oral administration of 14C-labelled tacrolimus, most of the radioactivity \nwas eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 2% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine. Less \nthan 1% of unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine and faeces, indicating that tacrolimus is \nalmost completely metabolised prior to elimination: bile being the principal route of elimination.  \n \nPaediatric data  \nIn paediatric liver transplant patients the mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (investigated with the \nModigraf granules) is 26%\u00b1 23% (individual range in paediatric liver transplant patients 4 - 80%). \nData on oral bioavailability of Modigraf in other indications is not available.  \nAfter oral administration (0.30 mg/kg/day) to paediatric liver transplant patients, steady-state \nconcentrations of tacrolimus were achieved within 3 days in the majority of patients.  \nIn paediatric liver and kidney transplant patients, values for total body clearance of \n2.3 \u00b1 1.2 ml/min/kg and 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 ml/min/kg, respectively, have been observed. Highly variable age \ndependent total body clearance and half life were observed in limited paediatric clinical investigations, \nespecially in early childhood.  \nThe half-life in paediatric transplant patients averages approximately 12 hours.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe kidneys and the pancreas were the primary organs affected in toxicity studies performed in rats \nand baboons. In rats, tacrolimus caused toxic effects to the nervous system and the eyes. Reversible \ncardiotoxic effects were observed in rabbits following intravenous administration of tacrolimus. \nWhen tacrolimus is administered intravenously as rapid infusion/bolus injection at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0 \nmg/kg, QTc prolongation has been observed in some animal species. Peak blood concentrations \nachieved with these doses were above 150 nanogram/mL which is more than 6-fold higher than mean \npeak concentrations observed with Modigraf in clinical transplantation.  \nEmbryofoetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits and was limited to doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. In rats, female reproductive function including birth was impaired at \ntoxic doses and the offspring showed reduced birth weights, viability and growth.  \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n-  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n-  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n-  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1.  What Modigraf is and what it is used for  \n2.  What you need to know before you take Modigraf  \n3.  How to take Modigraf \n4.  Possible side effects  \n5.  How to store Modigraf  \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Modigraf is and what it is used for  \n \nModigraf contains the active substance tacrolimus. It is an immunosuppressant. Following your organ \ntransplant (e.g. liver, kidney, heart), your body\u2019s immune system will try to reject the new organ. \nModigraf is used to control your body\u2019s immune response enabling your body to accept the \ntransplanted organ.  \n \nYou may also be given Modigraf for an ongoing rejection of your transplanted liver, kidney, heart or \nother organ or if any previous treatment you were taking was unable to control this immune response \nafter your transplantation. \n \nModigraf is used in adults and children. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take Modigraf \n \nDo not take Modigraf \n-  If you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n-  If you are allergic to sirolimus (another substance used to prevent rejection of your transplanted \n\norgan) or to any macrolide antibiotic (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Modigraf  \n \n-  if you have or have had liver problems.  \n-  if you have diarrhoea for more than one day.  \n- if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, \n\nfever, nausea or vomiting \n- if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called \u201cQT prolongation\u201d. \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nTell your doctor immediately if during treatment you suffer from: \n\nproblems with your vision such as blurred vision, changes in colour vision, difficulty in seeing detail \nor if your field of vision becomes restricted. \n \nYour doctor may need to adjust your dose of Modigraf.  \n \nYou should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do \nblood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of Modigraf.  \n \nYou should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Modigraf. This is \nbecause immunosuppressants like Modigraf could increase the risk of skin cancer. In case of sun \nexposure, wear appropriate protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor.  \n \nOther medicines and Modigraf \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIt is not recommended that Modigraf is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the \nprevention of transplant organ rejection).  \n \nModigraf blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other \nmedicines can be affected by taking Modigraf, which may require interruption, an increase or a \ndecrease in Modigraf dose. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently \ntaken medicines like:  \n-  antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat \n\ninfections e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and \nisavuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, and rifampicin \n\n- letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus)  \n-  HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, \n\nand combination tablets, used to treat HIV infection  \n-  HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, and the combination \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir), used to treat hepatitis C infection \n- nilotinib and imatinib (used to treat certain cancers) \n- mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection  \n- medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine)  \n-  anti-emetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g. metoclopramide)  \n-  cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn  \n-  the contraceptive pill, hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, or hormone treatments with \n\ndanazol  \n-  medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g. nifedipine, nicardipine, \n\ndiltiazem and verapamil)  \n-  anti-arrhythmic medicines (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the \n\nheart) \n-  medicines known as \u201cstatins\u201d used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides  \n-  phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy  \n-  the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of \n\ncorticosteroids used to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g. in transplant \nrejection) \n\n-  nefazodone, used to treat depression  \n- Herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or extracts of \n\nSchisandra sphenanthera.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and \npain), amphotericin B (used to treat bacterial infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. \naciclovir). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems when taken together with Modigraf.  \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nYour doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for \nheart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), \nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and \npain, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take Modigraf.  \n \nIf you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before.  \n \nModigraf with food and drink \nYou should generally take Modigraf on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to 3 hours \nafter a meal. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking Modigraf, since it can \naffect its levels in the blood.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you take Modigraf during pregnancy, it may pass into your baby through the placenta. It could \npotentially influence the health of the baby or adversely influence the course of the pregnancy. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \nModigraf passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using Modigraf.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly \nafter taking Modigraf. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol.  \n \nModigraf contains lactose and sodium \nModigraf contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3.  How to take Modigraf \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. Modigraf should be prescribed by doctors trained to treat transplant patients and \nexperienced in the use of medicines that control the body\u2019s immune system (immunosuppressants). \n \nMake sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, \nunless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine.  \n \nThis medicine should be taken twice a day. If the physical appearance  has changed from the normal \nwhite granules, or if dose instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as \npossible to make sure that you have the right medicine.  \n \nThe starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor \ncalculated according to your body weight. Initial doses just after transplantation will generally be in \nthe range of 0.075 - 0.30 mg per kg body weight per day depending on the transplanted organ. When \ntreating rejection, these same doses may be used. \n \nYour dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medicines you \nare taking.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren and adolescents will receive doses of Modigraf calculated in the same way as adults. In \ngeneral children need higher doses per kg of body weight to achieve the same effective levels in the \nblood as adults. \n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nFollowing the initiation of your treatment with Modigraf, frequent blood tests will be taken by your \ndoctor to define the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually \nreduce your Modigraf dose once your condition has stabilised. Your doctor will tell you exactly how \nmany sachets to take. \n \nYou will need to take Modigraf every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection \nof your transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n \nModigraf is taken orally twice daily, usually in the morning and evening. Take Modigraf on an empty \nstomach or 2 to 3 hours after a meal. Wait at least 1 hour until the next meal.  \n \nHow to prepare the Modigraf sachets for use?  \nYour doctor will advise you on the number of sachets that you need to open and the volume of water \nthat is required to make a suspension. For accurate measuring the volume of water you can use a \nsyringe or graduated cylinder.  \n \nPour the prescribed volume of water (at room temperature) into a glass or cup, up to a maximum of \n50 ml. Place the cup with water on a stable surface. Do not use cups or spoons that are made of PVC \n(polyvinylchloride) to take Modigraf because the active substance in Modigraf may stick to PVC.  \nCarefully open the prescribed number of sachets, e.g. with a pair of scissors  at the point indicated \nwith an arrow. Hold the opened sachet between thumb and index finger above the cup with the open \nside of the sachet facing downwards. Gently tap on the closed end of the sachet and pour the contents \nof each sachet into the glass or cup containing the water. Do not use any utensils or liquids to empty \nthe sachet. If you follow these instructions, you will get the right amount of granules from the sachet. \nIt is normal that some granules stay behind; the sachet was designed that way.  \nStir, or swirl gently until the granules have been suspended completely. The suspension can be drawn \nup with a syringe or swallowed directly by the patient. The liquid has a sweet taste. Rinse the glass or \ncup once with the same amount of water and drink this, too. The liquid should be drunk immediately \nafter preparation.  \n \nIf you take more Modigraf than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too much Modigraf, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take Modigraf \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.  \nIf you have forgotten to take your Modigraf, wait until it is time for the next dose, and then continue as \nbefore. \n \nIf you stop taking Modigraf \nStopping your treatment with Modigraf may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ.  \nDo not stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nModigraf reduces your body\u2019s defence mechanism (immune system), which will not be as good at \nfighting infections. Therefore, you may be more prone to infections while you are taking Modigraf.  \n \nSevere effects may occur, including allergic and anaphylactic reactions (a very serious type of allergic \nreaction with fainting and difficulty breathing, which needs immediate medical attention). Benign and \nmalignant tumours have been reported following Modigraf treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nCases of pure red cell aplasia (a very severe reduction in red blood cell counts), agranulocytosis (a \nseverely lowered number of white blood cells), haemolytic anaemia (decreased number of red blood \ncells due to abnormal breakdown) and febrile neutropenia (a decrease in the type of white blood cells \nwhich fight infection, accompanied by fever) have been reported.

modigraf", "Section_Content": "do not take modigraf - if you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you are allergic to sirolimus (another substance used to prevent rejection of your transplanted organ) or to any macrolide antibiotic (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking modigraf - if you have or have had liver problems. - if you have diarrhoea for more than one day. - if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, fever, nausea or vomiting - if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called \"qt prolongation\". tell your doctor immediately if during treatment you suffer from: problems with your vision such as blurred vision, changes in colour vision, difficulty in seeing detail or if your field of vision becomes restricted. your doctor may need to adjust your dose of modigraf. you should keep in regular contact with your doctor. from time to time, your doctor may need to do blood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of modigraf. you should limit your exposure to the sun and uv (ultraviolet) light whilst taking modigraf. this is because immunosuppressants like modigraf could increase the risk of skin cancer. in case of sun exposure, wear appropriate protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor. other medicines and modigraf tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is not recommended that modigraf is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the prevention of transplant organ rejection). modigraf blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other medicines can be affected by taking modigraf, which may require interruption, an increase or a decrease in modigraf dose. in particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken medicines like: - antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat infections e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and isavuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, and rifampicin - letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by cmv (human cytomegalovirus) - hiv protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, and combination tablets, used to treat hiv infection - hcv protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, and the combination ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir), used to treat hepatitis c infection - nilotinib and imatinib (used to treat certain cancers) - mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection - medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine) - anti-emetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g. metoclopramide) - cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn - the contraceptive pill, hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, or hormone treatments with danazol - medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g. nifedipine, nicardipine, diltiazem and verapamil) - anti-arrhythmic medicines (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the heart) - medicines known as \"statins\" used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides - phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy - the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of corticosteroids used to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g. in transplant rejection) - nefazodone, used to treat depression - herbal preparations containing st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum) or extracts of schisandra sphenanthera. tell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and pain), amphotericin b (used to treat bacterial infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. aciclovir). these may worsen kidney or nervous system problems when taken together with modigraf. your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for heart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and pain, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take modigraf. if you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. modigraf with food and drink you should generally take modigraf on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to 3 hours after a meal. grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking modigraf, since it can affect its levels in the blood. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you take modigraf during pregnancy, it may pass into your baby through the placenta. it could potentially influence the health of the baby or adversely influence the course of the pregnancy. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. modigraf passes into breast milk. therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using modigraf. driving and using machines do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly after taking modigraf. these effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. modigraf contains lactose and sodium modigraf contains lactose (milk sugar). if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "modigraf", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 5, "BeginOffset": 12, "EndOffset": 20, "Score": 0.31663110852241516,

"Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. modigraf should be prescribed by doctors trained to treat transplant patients and experienced in the use of medicines that control the body's immune system (immunosuppressants). make sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, unless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine. this medicine should be taken twice a day. if the physical appearance has changed from the normal white granules, or if dose instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to make sure that you have the right medicine. the starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor calculated according to your body weight. initial doses just after transplantation will generally be in the range of 0.075 - 0.30 mg per kg body weight per day depending on the transplanted organ. when treating rejection, these same doses may be used. your dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medicines you are taking. children and adolescents children and adolescents will receive doses of modigraf calculated in the same way as adults. in general children need higher doses per kg of body weight to achieve the same effective levels in the blood as adults. following the initiation of your treatment with modigraf, frequent blood tests will be taken by your doctor to define the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. your doctor will usually reduce your modigraf dose once your condition has stabilised. your doctor will tell you exactly how many sachets to take. you will need to take modigraf every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection of your transplanted organ. you should keep in regular contact with your doctor. modigraf is taken orally twice daily, usually in the morning and evening. take modigraf on an empty stomach or 2 to 3 hours after a meal. wait at least 1 hour until the next meal. how to prepare the modigraf sachets for use? your doctor will advise you on the number of sachets that you need to open and the volume of water that is required to make a suspension. for accurate measuring the volume of water you can use a syringe or graduated cylinder. pour the prescribed volume of water (at room temperature) into a glass or cup, up to a maximum of 50 ml. place the cup with water on a stable surface. do not use cups or spoons that are made of pvc (polyvinylchloride) to take modigraf because the active substance in modigraf may stick to pvc. carefully open the prescribed number of sachets, e.g. with a pair of scissors at the point indicated with an arrow. hold the opened sachet between thumb and index finger above the cup with the open side of the sachet facing downwards. gently tap on the closed end of the sachet and pour the contents of each sachet into the glass or cup containing the water. do not use any utensils or liquids to empty the sachet. if you follow these instructions, you will get the right amount of granules from the sachet. it is normal that some granules stay behind; the sachet was designed that way. stir, or swirl gently until the granules have been suspended completely. the suspension can be drawn up with a syringe or swallowed directly by the patient. the liquid has a sweet taste. rinse the glass or cup once with the same amount of water and drink this, too. the liquid should be drunk immediately after preparation. if you take more modigraf than you should if you have accidentally taken too much modigraf, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency department immediately. if you forget to take modigraf do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. if you have forgotten to take your modigraf, wait until it is time for the next dose, and then continue as before. if you stop taking modigraf stopping your treatment with modigraf may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ. do not stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "modigraf", "Type":

anaphylactic reactions (a very serious type of allergic reaction with fainting and difficulty breathing, which needs immediate medical attention). benign and malignant tumours have been reported following modigraf treatment. cases of pure red cell aplasia (a very severe reduction in red blood cell counts), agranulocytosis (a severely lowered number of white blood cells), haemolytic anaemia (decreased number of red blood cells due to abnormal breakdown) and febrile neutropenia (a decrease in the type of white blood cells which fight infection, accompanied by fever) have been reported. it is not known exactly how often these side effects occur. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - increased blood sugar, diabetes mellitus, increased potassium in the blood - difficulty in sleeping - trembling, headache - increased blood pressure - liver function tests abnormal - diarrhoea, nausea - kidney problems common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - reduction in blood cell counts (platelets, red or white blood cells), increase in white blood cell counts, changes in red blood cell counts (seen in blood tests) - reduced magnesium, phosphate, potassium, calcium or sodium in the blood, fluid overload, increased uric acid or lipids in the blood, decreased appetite, increased acidity of the blood, other changes in the blood salts (seen in blood tests) - anxiety symptoms, confusion and disorientation, depression, mood changes, nightmare, hallucination, mental disorders - fits, disturbances in consciousness, tingling and numbness (sometimes painful) in the hands and feet, dizziness, impaired writing ability, nervous system disorders - blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light, eye disorders - ringing sound in your ears - reduced blood flow in the heart vessels, faster heartbeat - bleeding, partial or complete blocking of blood vessels, reduced blood pressure - shortness in breath, changes in the lung tissue, collection of liquid around the lung, inflammation of the throat, cough, flu-like symptoms - stomach problems such as inflammation or ulcer causing abdominal pain or diarrhoea, bleeding in the stomach, inflammation or ulcer in the mouth, collection of fluid in the belly, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion, constipation, passing wind, bloating, loose stools - bile duct disorders, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems, liver tissue damage and inflammation of the liver - itching, rash, hair loss, acne, increased sweating - pain in joints, limbs, back and feet, muscle spasms - insufficient function of the kidneys, reduced production of urine, impaired or painful urination - general weakness, fever, collection of fluid in your body, pain and discomfort, increase of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in your blood, weight gain, feeling of temperature disturbed - insufficient function of your transplanted organ uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - changes in blood clotting, reduction in the number of all types of blood cells (seen in blood tests) - dehydration, inability to urinate - abnormal blood test results: reduced protein or
