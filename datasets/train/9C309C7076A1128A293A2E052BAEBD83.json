NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPlenadren 5 mg modified-release tablets\nPlenadren 20 mg modified-release tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nPlenadren 5 mg modified-release tablets\nEach modified-release tablet contains hydrocortisone 5 mg.\n\nPlenadren 20 mg modified-release tablets\nEach modified-release tablet contains hydrocortisone 20 mg.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nModified-release tablet.\n\nPlenadren 5 mg modified-release tablets\nThe tablets are round (diameter 8 mm), convex and pink.\n\nPlenadren 20 mg modified-release tablets\nThe tablets are round (diameter 8 mm), convex and white.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nPlenadren is given as maintenance therapy. Oral replacement doses must be individualised according to \nthe clinical response. A common maintenance dose is 20\u201330 mg per day, given once daily in the \nmorning. In patients with some remaining endogenous cortisol production a lower dose may be \nsufficient. 40 mg is the highest maintenance dose studied. The lowest possible maintenance dosage \nshould be used. In situations when the body is exposed to excessive physical and/or mental stress, \npatients may need additional substitution of immediate release hydrocortisone tablets especially in the \nafternoon/evening, see also section \u2018Use in intercurrent illness\u2019 where other ways of temporarily \nincreasing the dose of hydrocortisone is described.\n\nChanging from conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment to Plenadren\nWhen changing patients from conventional oral hydrocortisone replacement therapy given three times \ndaily to Plenadren, an identical total daily dose may be given. Due to a lower bioavailability of the daily \ndose of Plenadren compared to that of conventional hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily (see \nsection 5.2) clinical response needs to be monitored and further dose individualisation may be required. \nChanging patients from hydrocortisone tablets given twice daily, cortisone acetate or synthetic \nglucocorticoids to Plenadren has not been studied, but changing to a hydrocortisone equivalent daily dose \nof Plenadren is recommended in these instances; further dose individualisation may be required.\n\n\n\n3\n\nUse in intercurrent illness\nDuring intercurrent illness, there should be high awareness of the risk of developing acute adrenal \ninsufficiency.\n\nIn severe situations, an increase in dose is immediately required and oral administration of hydrocortisone \nmust be replaced with parenteral, preferably intravenous treatment. Intravenous administration of \nhydrocortisone is warranted during transient illness episodes such as severe infections, in particular \ngastroenteritis associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea, high fever of any aetiology or extensive physical \nstress, such as for instance serious accidents and surgery under general anaesthesia, see section 4.4.\n\nIn less severe situations when intravenous administration of hydrocortisone is not required, for instance \nlow grade infections, fever of any aetiology and stressful situations such as minor surgical procedures, \nthe normal oral daily replacement dose must be increased temporarily; the total daily dose should be \nincreased by administering the maintenance dose twice or thrice daily with 8 \u00b12 hours intervals (an \nincrease in number of administrations, not increasing the morning dose). This regimen has been \ndocumented in over 300 intercurrent illness episodes within the clinical study programme. At the \ndiscretion of the treating physician, immediate release hydrocortisone tablets can be given instead of \nPlenadren or may be added to treatment. Increasing the dose of hydrocortisone at one dose occasion \nincreases the total plasma exposure of cortisol less than proportional, see section 5.2. Once the \nintercurrent illness episode is over, patients can return to the normal maintenance dose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nIn case of age-related low body weight, monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose \nadjustment to a lower dose may be required, see section 5.2.\n\nRenal impairment\nThere is no need for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients \nwith severe renal impairment monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose adjustment \nmay be required, see section 5.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThere is no need for dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In case of severe hepatic \nimpairment, the functional liver mass decreases and thus the metabolising capacity for hydrocortisone. \nTherefore, monitoring of the clinical response is recommended and dose adjustment may be required, \nsee section 5.2.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Plenadren in children/adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nPatients should be instructed to take Plenadren orally with a glass of water on awakening at least \n30 minutes before food intake, preferably in an upright position and between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the \nmorning. It should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be divided, chewed or crushed. If more than \none daily administration is required the morning dose should be given as instructed, additional doses given \nlater during the day can be given with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAcute adrenal insufficiency\nAcute adrenal insufficiency may develop in patients with known adrenal insufficiency who are on \ninadequate daily doses or in situations with increased cortisol need. Events have been reported in \npatients treated with Plenadren. Adrenal crisis can develop in patients with acute adrenal insufficiency. \nTherefore, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency and of \nadrenal crisis and the need to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nDuring adrenal crisis parenteral, preferably intravenous administration of hydrocortisone in high doses, \ntogether with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion, should be administered according \nto current treatment guidelines.\n\nConcomitant infections\nDuring transient illnesses such as low grade infection, fever of any aetiology, stressful situations such as \nminor surgical procedures, the daily replacement dose must be increased temporarily, see section 4.2, \n\u2018Use in intercurrent illness\u2019. The patient must be carefully informed how to act in these situations and \nalso advised to immediately seek medical attention should an acute deterioration occur; especially in \ncases of gastroenteritis, vomiting and/or diarrhoea leading to fluid and salt loss, as well as to inadequate \nabsorption of oral hydrocortisone.\n\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency and concomitant retroviral infection, such as HIV, need careful dose \nadjustment due to potential interaction with antiretroviral medicinal products and increased \nhydrocortisone dose due to the infection.\n\nScientific reports do not support immunosuppressive effects of hydrocortisone in doses that have been \nused for replacement therapy in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, there is no reason to \nbelieve that replacement doses of hydrocortisone will exacerbate any systemic infection or worsen the \noutcome of such an infection. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that doses of hydrocortisone used \nfor replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency may reduce the response to vaccines and increase the \nrisk of generalised infection with live vaccines.\n\nGastric emptying and motility disorders\nModified-release tablets are not recommended in patients with increased gastrointestinal motility, i.e.,\nchronic diarrhoea, due to the risk of impaired cortisol exposure. There are no data in patients with \nconfirmed slow gastric emptying or decreased motility disease/disorder. The clinical response should be \nmonitored in patients with these conditions.\n\nUsing higher than normal doses of hydrocortisone\nHigh (supra-physiological) dosages of hydrocortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and \nwater retention, and increased excretion of potassium. Long-term treatment with higher than \nphysiological hydrocortisone doses can lead to clinical features resembling Cushing\u00b4s syndrome with \nincreased adiposity, abdominal obesity, hypertension and diabetes, and thus result in an increased risk of \ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\n\nOld age and low body mass index are known risk factors for common adverse reactions of \npharmacological doses of glucocorticoids such as osteoporosis, thinning of skin, diabetes mellitus, \nhypertension and increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nAll glucocorticoids increase calcium excretion and reduce the bone-remodelling rate. Patients with \nadrenal insufficiency on long-term glucocorticoid replacement therapy have been found to have reduced \nbone mineral density.\n\nProlonged use of high doses of glucocorticoids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, and \nglaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves. Such effects have not been reported in patients \nreceiving replacement therapy with glucocorticoids in doses used in adrenal insufficiency.\n\n\n\n5\n\nPsychiatric adverse reactions may occur with systemic glucocorticoids. This may occur during \ncommencement of treatment and during dose adjustments. Risks may be higher when high doses are \ngiven. Most reactions resolve after dose reduction, although specific treatment may be necessary.\n\nThyroid function\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency should be monitored for thyroid dysfunction as both hypothyroidism \nand hyperthyroidism may markedly influence the exposure of administered hydrocortisone.\n\nTreatment of primary adrenal insufficiency often warrants addition of a mineralocorticoid.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nHydrocortisone interactions listed below have been reported after therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids.\n\nPotent CYP 3A4 inducers such as phenytoin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, \nSt. John\u2019s wort and less potent inducers such as the antiretroviral medicinal products efavirenz and \nnevirapine can enhance the metabolic clearance of cortisol, decrease terminal half-life and thus reduce\ncirculating levels and increase fluctuations of cortisol (due to shorter terminal half-life). This may \nrequire dose adjustment of hydrocortisone.\n\nPotent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole \nerythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and grapefruit juice can inhibit the metabolism of \nhydrocortisone, and thus increase blood levels. During long-term prophylactic treatment with any of the \nantibiotics, adjustment of the hydrocortisone dosage should be considered.\n\nThe effect of corticosteroids may be reduced for 3-4 days after treatment with mifepristone.\n\nThe clinical response needs to be monitored in patients given medicinal products affecting gastric \nemptying and motility, see section 4.4.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nPlenadren can be used during pregnancy. There is no indication that hydrocortisone replacement therapy \nin pregnant women with adrenal insufficiency is associated with adverse outcome of the mother and/or \nthe foetus. Untreated adrenal insufficiency during pregnancy is associated with poor outcome of both \nthe mother and the foetus, therefore it is important to continue treatment during pregnancy.\n\nReproductive studies in animals have shown that glucocorticoids can cause foetal abnormalities and \nreproductive toxicity, see section 5.3.\n\nThe dose of hydrocortisone should be carefully monitored during pregnancy in women with adrenal \ninsufficiency. Dosing according to individual clinical response is recommended.\n\nBreast-feeding\nHydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. Plenadren can be used during breast-feeding. Doses of \nhydrocortisone used for replacement therapy are unlikely to have any clinically significant impact on the \nchild. Infants of mothers taking high doses of systemic glucocorticoids for prolonged periods may be at \nrisk of adrenal suppression.\n\nFertility\nPatients with adrenal insufficiency have been shown to have reduced parity, which is most likely due to \nthe underlying disease, but there is no indication that hydrocortisone in doses for replacement therapy \nwill affect fertility. \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPlenadren has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and episodes of \nshort-lasting vertigo have been reported.\n\nUntreated and poorly replaced adrenal insufficiency may affect the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nHydrocortisone is given as replacement therapy aimed at restoring normal cortisol levels. The adverse \nreaction profile in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is therefore not comparable to that in other \nconditions requiring much higher doses of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids.\n\nOverall, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar for Plenadren once daily modified-\nrelease tablets and hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily in a 12-week study. There was an \ninitial increase in the frequency of adverse reactions in about one in five patients, observed up to eight \nweeks after first changing from conventional hydrocortisone tablets given three times daily to once daily \nmodified-release tablets. However, these adverse reactions (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and \nfatigue) are mild or moderate, transient, of short duration but may require dose adjustment or additional \nconcomitant medicinal products, see section 4.2. Fatigue has been reported as very common.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nA total of 80 patients (173 patient-years of data) have been treated with modified-release hydrocortisone\nin clinical studies. Adverse reactions from these studies and from postmarketing surveillance are listed \nbelow by system organ class and frequency as follows:\nVery common (\uf0b31/10); Common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10).\n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Frequency of adverse reactions\nVery common Common\n\nNervous system disorders Vertigo\nHeadache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Upper abdominal pain\nNausea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nPruritus\nRash\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\nArthralgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nFatigue\n\nIn addition the following adverse reactions have been reported for other hydrocortisone medicinal \nproducts given for indications other than adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy in higher doses \n(frequencies not known).\n\nImmune system disorders\nActivation of infection (tuberculosis, fungal and viral infections including herpes).\n\nEndocrine disorders\nInduction of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus.\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nSodium and water retention and oedema tendency, hypertension, hypokalaemia.\n\n\n\n7\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nEuphoria and psychosis, insomnia.\n\nEye disorders\nIncreased intraocular pressure and cataract.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nDyspepsia and deterioration of existing gastric ulcer.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nCushing-like symptoms, stria, ecchymoses, acne and hirsutism, impaired wound healing.\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nOsteoporosis with spontaneous fractures.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nReports of acute toxicity and/or deaths following hydrocortisone overdose are rare. No antidote is \navailable. Symptoms may range from excitement/arousal to mania or psychosis. Signs include high \nblood pressure, elevated plasma glucose levels and hypokalaemia. Treatment is probably not indicated \nfor reactions due to chronic poisoning unless the patient has a condition that would render him/her \nunusually susceptible to ill effects from hydrocortisone. In which case, symptomatic treatment should be\ninstituted as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids for systemic use, glucocorticoids. ATC code: H02AB09.\n\nPharmacodynamic action\nHydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid and the synthetic form of endogenously produced cortisol. \nGlucocorticoids are important steroids for intermediary metabolism, immune function, musculoskeletal \nand connective tissue and the brain. Cortisol is the principal glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal \ncortex.\n\nNaturally-occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisol), which also have salt-retaining \nproperties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency. They are also used for their potent \nanti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and \nvaried metabolic effects. In addition they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.\n\nClinical efficacy\nThe pivotal study was a randomised, two-period 12-week crossover multi-centre trial in 64 patients with \nprimary adrenal insufficiency, 11 of whom had concomitant diabetes mellitus and 11 had hypertension. \nThe study compared modified-release tablets given once daily with conventional tablets given \nthree times daily using the same daily dose of hydrocortisone (20 to 40 mg).\n\n\n\n8\n\nCompared to conventional tablets given three times daily, once daily modified-release tablets resulted in \nan increased cortisol exposure during the first four hours after intake in the morning but reduced \nexposure in the late afternoon/evening and over the 24-hour period (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Observed mean serum cortisol concentration versus clock time following single and multiple \ndosing in primary adrenal insufficiency patients (n=62) after oral administration of Plenadren given \nonce daily and hydrocortisone thrice daily.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration, hydrocortisone is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal \ntract and the absorption has been reported to be more than 95% for an oral 20 mg dose (tablets). \nHydrocortisone is a class II active substance according to the biopharmaceutical classification system \n(BCS) with a high intestinal permeability and a low dissolution rate, especially at higher doses. The \nmodified-release tablet has an outer coating layer that provides an immediate release of the drug and an \nextended release core. The immediate-release part provides a rapid onset of absorption and the \nextended-release part provides a more extended plasma profile of cortisol. The bioavailability \n(AUC0-24h) is 20% lower with the modified-release tablet compared to the same daily dose of \nhydrocortisone given as conventional tablets three times daily. When the oral dose is increased the total \nplasma exposure of cortisol increased less than proportional. The exposure increased three-fold when \nthe dose of hydrocortisone modified-release increased from 5 mg to 20 mg.\n\nThe absorption rate of hydrocortisone was reduced after food intake resulting in a delay in the time to \nmaximal concentration in plasma from on average less than 1 hour to over 2.5 hours. On the other hand, \nthe extent of absorption and bioavailability was approximately 30% higher for the 20 mg tablet after \nfood intake compared to fasting and there was no absorption failure or dose dumping.\n\nDistribution\nIn plasma, cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG, also called transcortin) and \nalbumin. The binding is about 90%.\n\nElimination\nThe terminal half-life has been reported to be about 1.5 hours following intravenous and oral dosing of \nhydrocortisone tablets. The terminal half-life of cortisol following administration of Plenadren was \nabout 3 hours and formulation release controlled. This terminal half-life is similar to the \npharmacokinetics of endogenous cortisol that also is secretion-controlled.\n\n\n\n9\n\nHydrocortisone (cortisol) is a lipophilic drug that is eliminated completely via metabolism with a low \nclearance and accordingly low intestinal and hepatic extraction ratios.\n\nHydrocortisone is eliminated completely by metabolism by 11\u00dfHSD type 1 and type 2 enzymes and \nCYP 3A4 in the liver and in peripheral tissue. CYP 3A4 is involved in the clearance of cortisol by the \nformation of 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol which is excreted in urine. The transport of cortisol across membranes \nis expected to be mediated mainly by passive diffusion and therefore renal and biliary clearances are \nnegligible.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nA small amount of cortisol is excreted in the urine unchanged (<0.5% of the daily production), meaning \nthat cortisol is eliminated completely by metabolism. Since severe renal impairment may affect \nmedicinal products completely eliminated via metabolism, dose adjustment may be needed.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo study has been performed in patients with hepatic impairment, however data in the literature for \nhydrocortisone support that no dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In \ncase of severe hepatic impairment, the functional liver mass decreases and thus the metabolising \ncapacity for hydrocortisone. This may require dose individualisation.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in children or adolescents.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal experiments have shown that prenatal exposure to very high doses of glucocorticoids can induce \nmalformations (cleft palate, skeletal malformations). Animal studies have also shown that prenatal \nexposure to high doses of glucocorticoids (but lower than teratogenic doses) may be associated with \nincreased risk of intrauterine growth retardation, cardiovascular disease in adulthood and permanent \nchanges in glucocorticoid receptor density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour.\n\n6.

What Plenadren is and what it is used for\n\nPlenadren contains a substance called hydrocortisone (sometimes called cortisol). Hydrocortisone is a \nglucocorticoid. It belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids occur naturally \nin the body, and help to maintain your general health and well-being.\n\nPlenadren is used in adults to treat a condition known as adrenal insufficiency, or cortisol deficiency. \nAdrenal insufficiency occurs when your adrenal glands (just above your kidneys) do not produce \nenough of the hormone cortisol. Patients suffering from long-term (chronic) adrenal insufficiency need a \nreplacement therapy to survive.\n\nPlenadren replaces the natural cortisol that is missing in adrenal insufficiency. The medicine delivers \nhydrocortisone to your body throughout the day. The cortisol levels in your blood increase rapidly to a \nmaximum level, about 1 hour after taking the tablet in the morning, and then gradually decrease over the \nday with no or almost no cortisol level in the blood in the late evening and night when the levels should \nbe low.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Plenadren\n\nDo not take Plenadren\n\n- if you are allergic to hydrocortisone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Plenadren\n- when you have a condition that makes you unable to take this medicine or when the medicine is \n\nnot absorbed properly from your stomach. This may happen when you have stomach problems \n\n\n\n24\n\ninvolving vomiting and/or diarrhoea. In these situations you should seek immediate medical care \nin order to receive treatment with injections of hydrocortisone and extra fluid administration.\n\n- if you have short-term or temporary illness such as infections, fever or situations causing a great \namount of physical stress, such as surgery: your dose of hydrocortisone must be temporarily \nincreased. Ask your doctor promptly for information on how you should handle these situations. \nIf you are to have surgery, tell your doctor/dentist before the surgery that you are taking this \nmedicine.\n\n- if for any other reason your general health is declining although you take your medicine as \nprescribed; seek immediate medical care.\n\n- if your thyroid gland is not working normally tell your doctor since your dose of Plenadren may \nneed to be adjusted.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nPlenadren is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old as it has not been \nstudied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Plenadren\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \nDuring long term treatment with medicines treating infections (antibiotics) the dose of Plenadren may \nneed adjustment by your doctor. If used with mifepristone, a treatment used to end a pregnancy, the \neffect of Plenadren may be reduced.\n\nIn addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any of the following medicines, as the dose \nof Plenadren may need to be changed:\n\n\uf0b7 Phenytoin, carbamazepine and barbiturates - used to treat epilepsy\n\uf0b7 Rifampicin or rifabutin - used to treat tuberculosis\n\uf0b7 Ritonavir, efavirenz and nevirapine \u2013 used to treat HIV infection\n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s wort - used to treat depression and other conditions\n\uf0b7 Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole - used to treat fungal infections\n\uf0b7 Erythromycin, telithromycin and clarithromycin - used to treat bacterial infections\n\nPlenadren with food and drink\n\nDo not take this medicine with grapefruit juice as the juice will conflict with the action of this medicine.\n\nPregnancy, breast feeding and fertility\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is important that you continue treatment with Plenadren during pregnancy. Treatment in pregnant \nwomen with adrenal insufficiency is unlikely to cause any harmful effects on the mother and/or the \nbaby. You should tell your doctor if you become pregnant as the dose of Plenadren may have to be \nadjusted.\n\nYou can breast-feed during Plenadren treatment. Hydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. Doses of \nhydrocortisone used for replacement therapy are unlikely to have any effect on the child. However, talk \nto your doctor if you plan to breast-feed your baby.\n\n\n\n25\n\nFertility in women with adrenal insufficiency or cortisol deficiency may be reduced. There is no \nindication that Plenadren, in doses used for replacement therapy, will have an effect on fertility.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nThis medicine may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Extreme tiredness \nand episodes of short-lasting dizziness (vertigo) have been reported. Poorly treated or untreated adrenal \ninsufficiency reduces your ability to concentrate and will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \nIt is therefore important to take this medicine as directed by your doctor when driving or using \nmachines. If you are affected do not drive or use machines, until you have discussed the issue with your \ndoctor.\n\n3. How to take Plenadren\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is specific for you and is decided by your doctor.\n\n\uf0b7 When you wake up in the morning swallow Plenadren tablets whole with a glass of water at least \n30 minutes before your breakfast, preferable between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the morning.\n\n\uf0b7 You should preferably be in an upright position.\n\uf0b7 Do not divide, crush or chew the tablets. These tablets deliver hydrocortisone to your body \n\nthroughout the day. If divided, crushed or chewed this may prevent the hydrocortisone dose in the \ntablet to cover the whole day, as it should.\n\nThe need for additional doses of Plenadren\n\nDuring short-term or temporary illnesses such as infection, fever, or physical stress such as surgery you \nwill need more hydrocortisone since the body cannot produce the additional amount of cortisol required in \nthese situations. The dose must therefore be increased temporarily and your doctor may advise you to use \nother hydrocortisone tablets instead of, or in addition to Plenadren. Please discuss this with your doctor \nand follow the instructions on how to act in these situations.\n\nThe daily dose of Plenadren may have to be doubled or tripled in milder conditions such as a mild \ninfection or stress. You should then take the second dose of this medicine 6 to 10 hours after the morning \ndose. If it is not enough to double the daily dose, you should take a third dose 6 to 10 hours after the \nsecond dose (6-10 hour intervals between doses). When your illness is over, return to your normal \nmaintenance dose of this medicine.\n\nThe following signs and symptoms may suggest that you need to take additional doses of Plenadren or \nother forms of hydrocortisone: fatigue, weight loss, stomach discomfort, feeling light headed when you \nchange from sitting to standing or dizziness when standing, darkening of your skin particularly skin \ncreases and exposed areas. Contact your doctor promptly for advice if you notice any of these.\n\nHowever, seek immediate medical help if you notice any of the following: severe weakness, fainting, \nabdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, reduced consciousness, delirium (very \nconfused state).\n\nIf you take more Plenadren than you should\n\nA too high dose of this medicine for more than a few days may be harmful to your health. Your blood \npressure may increase, you may gain extra weight and your blood sugar may become too high. An \nincreased dose is necessary occasionally in order for the body to cope with increased stress such as \nfever. If extra doses are needed frequently and regularly, you should contact your doctor for \nre-evaluation of your maintenance dose.\n\n\n\n26\n\nIf you forget to take Plenadren\n\nIf you have forgotten to take your tablet in the morning, take it as soon as possible thereafter. Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you experience any signs or symptoms listed in \nthe section \u201cThe need for additional doses of Plenadren\u201d, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you stop taking Plenadren\n\nStopping Plenadren may be life threatening. It is therefore important to continue taking this medicine as \nprescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nIf you are changing treatment from other hydrocortisone tablets to Plenadren you may experience side \neffects during the first weeks. These side effects can be: stomach pain, feeling sick and tiredness. They \nwill normally disappear with time, if not contact your doctor.\n\nSide effects of this medicine are:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 Dizziness\n\uf0b7 Headache\n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 Tiredness\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 Stomach pain/heartburn, feeling sick or nauseated\n\uf0b7 Pain in the joints\n\uf0b7 Rash\n\uf0b7 Itchiness\n\nAdditional side effects have been reported for other hydrocortisone medicines. These medicines have \nalso been given for other indications than adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy, often in higher \ndoses. Frequencies of these possible side effects are not known (frequency cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these side effects:\n\n\uf0b7 More prone to infection\n\uf0b7 Diabetes or problems with blood sugar levels (shown in blood tests)\n\uf0b7 Salt and water retention causing swelling and raised blood pressure (shown on medical \n\nexamination) and low potassium level in the blood\n\uf0b7 Mood changes such as feelings of overexcitement or losing touch with reality\n\uf0b7 Difficulty sleeping\n\uf0b7 Raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma), clouding of the lens in the eye (cataract)\n\uf0b7 Heartburn, aggravation of any existing stomach ulcer\n\uf0b7 Weakening of the bones - this may cause bone fractures\n\uf0b7 Stretch marks, bruising, acne-like rash, excessive growth of facial hair, slow wound healing.\n\n\n\n27\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine.\n\n5. How to store Plenadren\n\nKeep out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle label and carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the dose is specific for you and is decided by your doctor. when you wake up in the morning swallow plenadren tablets whole with a glass of water at least 30 minutes before your breakfast, preferable between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the morning. you should preferably be in an upright position. do not divide, crush or chew the tablets. these tablets deliver hydrocortisone to your body throughout the day. if divided, crushed or chewed this may prevent the hydrocortisone dose in the tablet to cover the whole day, as it should. the need for additional doses of plenadren during short-term or temporary illnesses such as infection, fever, or physical stress such as surgery you will need more hydrocortisone since the body cannot produce the additional amount of cortisol required in these situations. the dose must therefore be increased temporarily and your doctor may advise you to use other hydrocortisone tablets instead of, or in addition to plenadren. please discuss this with your doctor and follow the instructions on how to act in these situations. the daily dose of plenadren may have to be doubled or tripled in milder conditions such as a mild infection or stress. you should then take the second dose of this medicine 6 to 10 hours after the morning dose. if it is not enough to double the daily dose, you should take a third dose 6 to 10 hours after the second dose (6-10 hour intervals between doses). when your illness is over, return to your normal maintenance dose of this medicine. the following signs and symptoms may suggest that you need to take additional doses of plenadren or other forms of hydrocortisone: fatigue, weight loss, stomach discomfort, feeling light headed when you change from sitting to standing or dizziness when standing, darkening of your skin particularly skin creases and exposed areas. contact your doctor promptly for advice if you notice any of these. however, seek immediate medical help if you notice any of the following: severe weakness, fainting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, reduced consciousness, delirium (very confused state). if you take more plenadren than you should a too high dose of this medicine for more than a few days may be harmful to your health. your blood pressure may increase, you may gain extra weight and your blood sugar may become too high. an increased dose is necessary occasionally in order for the body to cope with increased stress such as fever. if extra doses are needed frequently and regularly, you should contact your doctor for re-evaluation of your maintenance dose. if you forget to take plenadren if you have forgotten to take your tablet in the morning, take it as soon as possible thereafter. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you experience any signs or symptoms listed in the section \"the need for additional doses of plenadren\", contact your doctor immediately. if you stop taking plenadren stopping plenadren may be life threatening. it is therefore important to continue taking this medicine as prescribed by your doctor. do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "plenadren", "Type":
