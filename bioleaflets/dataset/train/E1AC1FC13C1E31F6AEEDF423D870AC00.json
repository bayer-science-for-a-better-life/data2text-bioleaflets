NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSonoVue 8 microlitres/mL powder and solvent for dispersion for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach   mL of the dispersion contains 8 \u00b5L sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles, equivalent to \n45 micrograms. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for dispersion for injection. \nWhite powder  \nClear, colourless solvent   \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nSonoVue is for use with ultrasound imaging to enhance the echogenicity of the blood, or of fluids in \nthe urinary tract which results in an improved signal to noise ratio. \n \nSonoVue should only be used in patients where study without contrast enhancement is inconclusive. \n \nEchocardiography \nSonoVue is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in adult patients with suspected \nor established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and enhance left \nventricular endocardial border delineation. \n \nDoppler of macrovasculature \nSonoVue increases the accuracy in detection or exclusion of abnormalities in cerebral arteries and \nextracranial carotid or peripheral arteries in adult patients by improving the Doppler signal to noise \nratio. \nSonoVue increases the quality of the Doppler flow image and the duration of clinically-useful signal \nenhancement in portal vein assessment in adult patients. \n \nDoppler of microvasculature \nSonoVue improves display of the vascularity of liver and breast lesions during Doppler sonography in \nadult patients leading to more specific lesion characterisation. \n \nUltrasonography of excretory urinary tract \nSonoVue is indicated for use in ultrasonography of the excretory tract in paediatric patients from \nnewborn to 18 years to detect vesicoureteral reflux. For the limitation in the interpretation of a \nnegative urosonography, see section 4.4. and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis product should only be used by physicians experienced in diagnostic ultrasound imaging. \nEmergency equipment and personnel trained in its use must be readily available. \n \n\n\n\n 3\n\n \nPosology \n \nIntravenous use  \nThe recommended doses of SonoVue in adults are: \n\uf0b7 B-mode imaging of cardiac chambers, at rest or with stress: 2 mL. \n\uf0b7 Vascular Doppler imaging: 2.4 mL. \nDuring a single examination, a second injection of the recommended dose can be made when deemed \nnecessary by the physician.  \n \nElderly Patients \nThe dose recommendations for intravenous administration also apply to elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric Patients \nThe safety and efficacy of SonoVue in patients under 18 years of age has not been established for \nintravenous administration and use in echocardiography and vascular Doppler imaging.  \n \nIntravesical use  \n\uf0b7 In paediatric patients the recommended dose of SonoVue is 1 mL \n \nMethod of administration  \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6. \n \nIntravenous use   \nSonoVue should be administered immediately after drawing into the syringe by injection into a \nperipheral vein. Every injection should be followed by a flush with 5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nIntravesical use  \nAfter introduction of a sterile 6F-8F urinary catheter into the bladder under sterile conditions, the \nbladder is emptied of urine and then filled with saline (normal sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution) \nto approximately one third or half of its predicted total volume [(age in years + 2) x 30] mL. SonoVue \nis then administered through the urinary catheter. Administration of SonoVue is followed by \ncompletion of bladder filling with saline until patient has the urge to micturate or there is the first \nslight sign of back pressure to the infusion. Ultrasound imaging of the bladder and kidneys is \nperformed during filling and voiding of the bladder. Immediately following the first voiding, the \nbladder may be refilled with saline for a second cycle of voiding and imaging, without the need of a \nsecond SonoVue administration.  A low mechanical index (\u2264 0.4) is recommended for imaging the \nbladder, ureters, and kidney during ultrasonography of the urinary tract with contrast. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nIntravenous use of SonoVue is contraindicated in patients known to have right-to-left shunts, severe \npulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure >90 mmHg), uncontrolled systemic hypertension, \nand in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. \nSonoVue must not be used in combination with dobutamine in patients with conditions suggesting \ncardiovascular instability where dobutamine is contraindicated. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nUse caution when treating anaphylaxis with epinephrine in patients on beta blockers since response \nmay be poor or promote undesired alpha-adrenergic and vagotonic effects (hypertension, bradycardia). \n \n\n\n\n 4\n\n \nIntravenous use \n \nPatients with unstable cardiopulmonary status \nECG monitoring should be performed in high-risk patients as clinically indicated. It is recommended \nto keep the patient under close medical supervision during and for at least 30 minutes following the \nadministration of SonoVue. \n \nUse extreme caution when considering the administration of Sonvue in patients with recent acute \ncoronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease, including: evolving or ongoing \nmyocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, significant worsening of cardiac \nsymptoms within last 7 days, recent coronary artery intervention or other factors suggesting clinical \ninstability (for example, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or clinical findings), acute cardiac \nfailure, Class III/IV cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders because in these patients allergy like \nand/or vasodilatory reactions may lead to life threatening conditions. SonoVue should only be \nadministered to such patients after careful risk/benefit assessment and a closely monitoring of vital \nsigns should be performed during and after administration. \n \nIt should be emphasised that stress echocardiography not only can induce an ischaemic episode but \nalso the stressors may induce predictable, dose-dependent effects on the cardiovascular system (e.g., \nincrease in heart rate, blood pressure and ventricular ectopic activity for dobutamine,  or decrease in \nblood pressure for adenosine and dipyridamole) as well as unpredictable, hypersensitivity reactions. \nTherefore, if SonoVue is to be used in conjunction with stress echocardiography patients must have a \nstable condition verified by absence of chest pain or ECG modification during the two preceding days. \nMoreover, ECG and blood pressure monitoring should be performed during SonoVue-enhanced \nechocardiography with a pharmacological stress (e.g. with dobutamine).  \n \nOther concomitant diseases \nCaution is advisable when administering the product to patients with: acute endocarditis, prosthetic \nvalves, acute systemic inflammation and/or sepsis, hyperactive coagulation states and/or recent \nthromboembolism, and end-stage renal or hepatic disease, as the numbers of patients with those \nconditions who were exposed to SonoVue in the clinical trials were limited. \n \nInterpretation of voiding urosonography with SonoVue and limitations of use \nFalse negative cases can occur with voiding ultrasonography with SonoVue and have not been \nclarified (see section 5.1). \n \nTechnical recommendation In animal studies, the application of echo-contrast agents revealed \nbiological adverse reactions (e.g. endothelial cell injury, capillary rupture) by interaction with the \nultrasound beam. Although these biological side effects have not been reported in humans, the use of a \nlow mechanical index is recommended. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy, lactation, and fertility \n \nPregnancy \n \nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects \nwith respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see \nsection 5.3 Preclinical safety data). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \n\n\n\n 5\n\nSonoVue during pregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is not known if sulphur hexafluoride is excreted in human milk. However, based on its rapid \nelimination from the body via the expired air, it is considered that the breastfeeding can be resumed \ntwo to three hours after administration of SonoVue. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical data are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSonoVue has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdult population-Intravenous use \n \nThe safety of SonoVue after intravenous administration was evaluated in 4653 adult patients who \nparticipated in 58 clinical trials. The undesirable effects reported with SonoVue after intravenous \nadministration were, in general, non-serious, transient and resolved spontaneously without residual \neffects. In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions after intravenous \nadministration are: headache, injection site reaction, and nausea. \n \nThe adverse reactions are classified by System Organ Class and frequency, using the following \nconvention: Very common (\u2265 1/10), Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < /100), \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data) \n\n\n\n 6\n\n \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Drug Reactions \nFrequency Category \n\nUncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000)\n\nNot known \nCannot be estimated \nfrom available data \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity*  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache, paraesthesia, \ndizziness, dysgeusia \n\n Vasovagal reaction \n \n\nEye disorders  Vision blurred,   \nCardiac disorders   Myocardial infarction** \n\nMyocardial ischemia** \nKounis syndrome*** \n\nVascular disorders Flushing Hypotension  \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, Abdominal pain  Vomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nRash  \n \n\nPruritus  \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nconnective tissue and \nbone disorders \n\n Back pain  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nChest discomfort, \ninjection site reaction, \nfeeling hot \n\nChest pain, pain, fatigue  \n\n*   Cases suggestive of hypersensitivity may include: skin erythema, bradycardia, hypotension, dyspnoea, loss of \nconsciousness, cardiac/cardio-respiratory arrest, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock. \n\n** In some of the cases of hypersensitivity, in patients with underlying coronary artery disease, myocardial \nischemia and/or myocardial infarctions were also reported. \n\n***Allergic acute coronary syndrome \n \nIn very rare cases, fatal outcomes have been reported in temporal association with the use of SonoVue. \nIn all these patients there was a high underlying risk for major cardiac complications, which could \nhave led to the fatal outcome. \n \nPaediatric population-Intravesical use \n \nThe safety of SonoVue after intravesical administration was based on evaluation of published \nliterature involving use of SonoVue in over 6000 paediatric patients (age range 2 days to 18 years). No \nadverse reactions were reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSince there have been no cases of overdose reported to date, neither signs nor symptoms of overdose \nhave been identified. In a Phase I study doses up to 52 mL of SonoVue were administered to normal \nvolunteers without serious adverse events being reported. In the event of overdose occurring, the \npatient should be observed and treated symptomatically. \n \n \n\n\n\n 7\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ultrasound contrast media  \nATC code: VO8DA05.  \nSulphur hexafluoride is an inert, innocuous gas, poorly soluble in aqueous solutions. There are \nliterature reports of the use of the gas in the study of respiratory physiology and in pneumatic \nretinopexy. The addition of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to the lyophilised \npowder followed by vigorous shaking results in the production of the microbubbles of sulphur \nhexafluoride. The microbubbles have a mean diameter of about 2.5 \u00b5m, with 90% having a diameter \nless than 6 \u00b5m and 99% having a diameter less than 11 \u00b5m. Each millilitre of SonoVue contains 8 \u00b5L \nof the microbubbles.  The intensity of the reflected signal is dependent on concentration of the \nmicrobubbles and frequency of the ultrasound beam .The interface between the sulphur hexafluoride \nbubble and the aqueous medium acts as a reflector of the ultrasound beam thus enhancing blood \nechogenicity and increasing contrast between the blood and the surrounding tissues. \n  \nIntravenous use \nAt the proposed clinical doses for intravenous administration, SonoVue has been shown to provide \nmarked increase in signal intensity of more than 2 minutes for B-mode imaging in echocardiography \nand of 3 to 8 minutes for Doppler imaging of the macrovasculature and microvasculature.  \n \nIntravesical use \nFor ultrasonography of the excretory urinary tract in paediatric patients, after intravesical \nadministration, SonoVue increases the signal intensity of fluids within the urethra, bladder, ureters, \nand renal pelvis, and facilitates the detection of reflux of fluid from the bladder into the ureters. \nThe efficacy of SonoVue for detection/exclusion of vesicoureteral reflux was studied in two published \nopen label single centre studies. The presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux with SonoVue \nultrasound was compared to the radiographic reference standard. In one study including 183 patients \n(366 kidney-ureter units), SonoVue ultrasound was correctly positive in 89 out 103 units with reflux \nand correctly negative in 226 out of 263 units without reflux. In the second study including 228 \npatients (463 kidney-ureter units), SonoVue ultrasound was correctly positive in 57 out of 71 units \nwith reflux and correctly negative in 302 out of 392 units without reflux. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe total amount of sulphur hexafluoride administered in a clinical dose is extremely small, (in a 2 mL \ndose the microbubbles contain 16 \u00b5l of gas). The sulphur hexafluoride dissolves in the blood and is \nsubsequently exhaled. \n \nAfter a single intravenous injection of 0.03 or 0.3 mL of SonoVue/kg (approximately 1 and 10 times \nthe maximum clinical dose) to human volunteers, the sulphur hexafluoride was cleared rapidly. The \nmean terminal half-life was 12 minutes (range 2 to 33 minutes). More than 80% of the administered \nsulphur hexafluoride was recovered in exhaled air within 2 minutes after injection and almost 100% \nafter 15 minutes.  \n \nIn patients with diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, the percent of dose recovered in expired air \naveraged 100% and the terminal half-life was similar to that measured in healthy volunteers. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction. Caecal lesions observed in some repeat-dose \nstudies with rats, but not in monkeys, are not relevant for humans under normal conditions of \nadministration.  \n\nIntravesical local tolerance for SonoVue was also assessed. A single-dose study and a repeat-dose \nstudy, both followed by a treatment-free period, were performed in female rats with local toxicity \n\n\n\n 8\n\nevaluated through macroscopic and histopathological examination of both kidneys, ureters, the urinary \nbladder and urethra. It did not reveal any test item-related lesions in any of the examined organs, in \nparticular in the urinary bladder, in both the single-dose and the repeat-dose studies. It was therefore \nconcluded that SonoVue is well tolerated in the urinary tract in the rat. \n\n \n \n6.

per patient. this dose might be repeated if needed up to 4.8 ml. for ultrasound scan of urinary tract in children the recommended dose is 1 ml per patient to be administered into the bladder as follows: after emptying the bladder, a saline solution will be introduced into the bladder via a thin tube. sonovue will then be administered through the thin tube and will be followed by administration of 22 saline to continue filling the bladder. the filling and emptying of the bladder with saline solution may be repeated if needed. if you have a serious pulmonary or cardiac condition you will be under close medical supervision during and for at least 30 minutes after the injection of sonovue. if you are given more sonovue than you should overdose is not likely to happen
