CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nProphylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTacforius is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. Tacforius therapy requires careful \nmonitoring by adequately qualified and equipped personnel. This medicinal product should only be \nprescribed, and changes in immunosuppressive therapy initiated, by physicians experienced in \nimmunosuppressive therapy and the management of transplant patients. \n \nInadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised switching of immediate- or prolonged-release formulations \nof tacrolimus is unsafe. This can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse reactions, \nincluding under- or overimmunosuppression, due to clinically relevant differences in systemic \nexposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the \ncorresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place \nunder the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Following conversion \nto any alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring must be performed and dose adjustments \nmade to ensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus is maintained. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial doses presented below are intended to act solely as a guideline. Tacforius is \nroutinely administered in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents in the initial post-\noperative period. The dose may vary depending upon the immunosuppressive regimen chosen. \nTacforius dosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \npatient individually aided by blood level monitoring (see below under “Therapeutic drug \nmonitoring”). If clinical signs of rejection are apparent, alteration of the immunosuppressive regimen \nshould be considered. \n \nIn de novo kidney and liver transplant patients AUC0-24 of tacrolimus for the prolonged-release \ncapsules on Day 1 was 30% and 50% lower respectively, when compared with that for the immediate \nrelease capsules at equivalent doses. By Day 4, systemic exposure as measured by trough levels is \nsimilar for both kidney and liver transplant patients with both formulations. Careful and frequent \nmonitoring of tacrolimus trough levels is recommended in the first two weeks post-transplant with \nTacforius to ensure adequate drug exposure in the immediate post-transplant period. As tacrolimus is a \nsubstance with low clearance, adjustments to the Tacforius dose regimen may take several days before \nsteady state is achieved. \n \nTo suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, no limit to the \nduration of oral therapy can be given. \n \nProphylaxis of kidney transplant rejection \n \nTacforius therapy should commence at a dose of 0.20 - 0.30 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence within 24 hours after the completion of surgery. \n \nTacforius doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to \nwithdraw concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to Tacforius monotherapy. Post-transplant \nchanges in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may \nnecessitate further dose adjustments. \n \nProphylaxis of liver transplant rejection \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTacforius therapy should commence at a dose of 0.10 - 0.20 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence approximately 12 - 18 hours after the completion of \nsurgery. \n \nTacforius doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. It is possible in some cases to \nwithdraw concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, leading to Tacforius monotherapy. Post-transplant \nimprovement in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may \nnecessitate further dose adjustments. \n \nConversion of tacrolimus immediate release capsules-treated patients to Tacforius \n \nAllograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily immediate release capsules dosing requiring \nconversion to once daily Tacforius should be converted on a 1:1 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis. \nTacforius should be administered in the morning. \n \nIn stable patients converted from tacrolimus immediate release capsules (twice daily) to tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules (once daily) on a 1:1 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the systemic exposure \nto tacrolimus (AUC0-24) for tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules was approximately 10% lower than \nthat for tacrolimus immediate release capsules. The relationship between tacrolimus trough levels \n(C24) and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) for tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules is similar to that of \ntacrolimus immediate release capsules. When converting from tacrolimus immediate release capsules \nto Tacforius prolonged-release capsules, trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and \nwithin two weeks after conversion. Following conversion, tacrolimus trough levels should be \nmonitored and if necessary dose adjustments made to maintain similar systemic exposure. Dose \nadjustments should be made to ensure that similar systemic exposure is maintained. \n \nConversion from ciclosporin to tacrolimus \n \nCare should be taken when converting patients from ciclosporin-based to tacrolimus-based therapy \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus is not \nrecommended. Tacforius therapy should be initiated after considering ciclosporin blood concentrations \nand the clinical condition of the patient. Dosing should be delayed in the presence of elevated \nciclosporin blood levels. In practice, tacrolimus-based therapy has been initiated 12 - 24 hours after \ndiscontinuation of ciclosporin. Monitoring of ciclosporin blood levels should be continued following \nconversion as the clearance of ciclosporin might be affected. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection \n \nIncreased doses of tacrolimus, supplemental corticosteroid therapy, and introduction of short courses \nof mono-/polyclonal antibodies have all been used to manage rejection episodes. If signs of toxicity \nsuch as severe adverse reactions are noted (see section 4.8), the dose of Tacforius may need to be \nreduced. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after kidney or liver transplantation \nFor conversion from other immunosuppressants to once daily Tacforius, treatment should begin with \nthe initial oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation respectively for prophylaxis of \ntransplant rejection. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after heart transplantation \nIn adult patients converted to Tacforius, an initial oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day should be administered \nonce daily in the morning. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after transplantation of other allografts \nAlthough there is no clinical experience with tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules in lung-, \npancreas- or intestine-transplanted patients, tacrolimus immediate release capsules have been used in \nlung-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg/kg/day, in pancreas-transplanted \n\n\n\n5 \n\npatients at an initial oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day and in intestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose \nof 0.3 mg/kg/day. \n \nTherapeutic drug monitoring \n \nDosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \nindividual patient aided by whole blood tacrolimus trough level monitoring. \n \nAs an aid to optimise dosing, several immunoassays are available for determining tacrolimus \nconcentrations in whole blood. Comparisons of concentrations from the published literature to \nindividual values in clinical practice should be assessed with care and knowledge of the assay methods \nemployed. In current clinical practice, whole blood levels are monitored using immunoassay methods. \nThe relationship between tacrolimus trough levels (C24) and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) is similar \nbetween the two formulations of tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules and tacrolimus immediate \nrelease capsules. \n \nBlood trough levels of tacrolimus should be monitored during the post-transplantation period. \nTacrolimus blood trough levels should be determined approximately 24 hours post-dosing of \nTacforius, just prior to the next dose. Frequent trough level monitoring in the initial two weeks post \ntransplantation is recommended, followed by periodic monitoring during maintenance therapy. Blood \ntrough levels of tacrolimus should also be closely monitored following conversion from tacrolimus \nimmediate release capsules to Tacforius, dose adjustments, changes in the immunosuppressive \nregimen, or co-administration of substances which may alter tacrolimus whole blood concentrations \n(see section 4.5). The frequency of blood level monitoring should be based on clinical needs. As \ntacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, following adjustments to the Tacforius dose regimen it \nmay take several days before the targeted steady state is achieved. \n \nData from clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients can be successfully managed if \ntacrolimus blood trough levels are maintained below 20 ng/ml. It is necessary to consider the clinical \ncondition of the patient when interpreting whole blood levels. In clinical practice, whole blood trough \nlevels have generally been in the range 5 - 20 ng/ml in liver transplant recipients and 10 - 20 ng/ml in \nkidney and heart transplant patients in the early post-transplant period. During subsequent \nmaintenance therapy, blood concentrations have generally been in the range of 5 - 15 ng/ml in liver, \nkidney and heart transplant recipients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the \ntacrolimus blood trough levels within the recommended target range. \n \nRenal impairment \nAs the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are unaffected by renal function (see section 5.2), no dose \nadjustment is required. However, owing to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus careful monitoring \nof renal function is recommended (including serial serum creatinine concentrations, calculation of \ncreatinine clearance and monitoring of urine output). \n \nRace \nIn comparison to Caucasians, black patients may require higher tacrolimus doses to achieve similar \ntrough levels. \n \nGender \nThere is no evidence that male and female patients require different doses to achieve similar trough \nlevels. \n \nElderly \nThere is no evidence currently available to indicate that dosing should be adjusted in the elderly. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Tacforius in children under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nLimited data are available but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTacforius is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. It is recommended that the oral daily dose of \nTacforius be administered once daily in the morning. Tacforius prolonged-release hard capsules \nshould be taken immediately following removal from the blister. Patients should be advised not to \nswallow the desiccant. The capsules should be swallowed whole with fluid (preferably water). \nTacforius should generally be administered on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to \n3 hours after a meal, to achieve maximal absorption (see section 5.2). A forgotten morning dose \nshould be taken as soon as possible on the same day. A double dose should not be taken on the next \nmorning. \n \nIn patients unable to take oral medicinal products during the immediate post-transplant period, \ntacrolimus therapy can be initiated intravenously (see Summary of Product Characteristics for \ntacrolimus 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion) at a dose approximately 1/5th of the \nrecommended oral dose for the corresponding indication. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to other macrolides. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed. This has led to serious adverse \nreactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions which could be a consequence of either \nunder- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of \ntacrolimus with the corresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should \nonly take place under the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nTacforius is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to limited data on safety and/or \nefficacy. \n \nFor treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult patients clinical data are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation of \ntacrolimus. \n \nFor prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart allograft recipients clinical data are not yet \navailable for the prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus. \n \nDuring the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken \non a routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, \nelectrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, \ncoagulation values, and plasma protein determinations. If clinically relevant changes are seen, \nadjustments of the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered. \n \nWhen substances with a potential for interaction (see section 4.5) - particularly strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (such as telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, \ntelithromycin or clarithromycin) or inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin) - are being \ncombined with tacrolimus, tacrolimus blood levels should be monitored to adjust the tacrolimus dose \nas appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nHerbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal preparations \nshould be avoided when taking tacrolimus due to the risk of interactions that lead to either a decrease \nin blood concentrations of tacrolimus and reduced clinical effect of tacrolimus, or an increase in blood \nconcentrations of tacrolimus and risk of tacrolimus toxicity (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be avoided and care should be \ntaken when administering tacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nHigh potassium intake or potassium-sparing diuretics should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nCertain combinations of tacrolimus with substances known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects \nmay increase the risk of these effects (see section 4.5). \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. As gastrointestinal \nperforation is a medically important event that may lead to a life-threatening or serious condition, \nadequate treatments should be considered immediately after suspected symptoms or signs occur. \n \nSince levels of tacrolimus in blood may significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, extra \nmonitoring of tacrolimus concentrations is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea. \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nVentricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the septum, reported as cardiomyopathies, have been \nobserved in patients treated with immediate release tacrolimus on rare occasions and may also occur \nwith prolonged-release tacrolimus. Most cases have been reversible, occurring with tacrolimus blood \ntrough concentrations much higher than the recommended maximum levels. Other factors observed to \nincrease the risk of these clinical conditions included pre-existing heart disease, corticosteroid usage, \nhypertension, renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid overload, and oedema. Accordingly, high-\nrisk patients receiving substantial immunosuppression should be monitored, using such procedures as \nechocardiography or ECG pre- and post-transplant (e.g. initially at 3 months and then at \n9 - 12 months). If abnormalities develop, dose reduction of Tacforius, or change of treatment to \nanother immunosuppressive agent should be considered. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT interval and \nmay cause Torsades de Pointes. Caution should be exercised in patients with risk factors for QT \nprolongation, including patients with a personal or family history of QT prolongation, congestive heart \nfailure, bradyarrhythmias and electrolyte abnormalities. Caution should also be exercised in patients \ndiagnosed or suspected to have Congenital Long QT Syndrome or acquired QT prolongation or \npatients on concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, induce electrolyte \nabnormalities or known to increase tacrolimus exposure (see section 4.5). \n \nLymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies \n \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-associated \nlymphoproliferative disorders (see section 4.8). A combination of immunosuppressives such as \nantilymphocytic antibodies (e.g. basiliximab, daclizumab) given concomitantly increases the risk of \nEBV associated lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-negative patients \nhave been reported to have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, \nin this patient group, EBV-VCA serology should be ascertained before starting treatment with \nTacforius. During treatment, careful monitoring with EBV-PCR is recommended. Positive EBV-PCR \nmay persist for months and is per se not indicative of lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAs with other potent immunosuppressive compounds, the risk of secondary cancer is unknown (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nAs with other immunosuppressive agents, owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes, \nexposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a \nsunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections including opportunistic infections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus are at increased risk for infections \nincluding opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal) such as BK virus associated \nnephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients are \nalso at an increased risk of infections with viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and C reactivation \nand de novo infection, as well as hepatitis E, which may become chronic). These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating hepatic or renal function or neurological symptoms. Prevention and management should \nbe in accordance with appropriate clinical guidance. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome (PRES). If patients taking tacrolimus present with symptoms indicating PRES such as \nheadache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances, a radiological procedure (e.g. MRI) \nshould be performed. If PRES is diagnosed, adequate blood pressure and seizure control and \nimmediate discontinuation of systemic tacrolimus is advised. Most patients completely recover after \nappropriate measures are taken. \n \nEye disorders \n \nEye disorders, sometimes progressing to loss of vision, have been reported in patients treated with \ntacrolimus. Some cases have reported resolution on switching to alternative immunosuppression. \nPatients should be advised to report changes in visual acuity, changes in colour vision, blurred vision, \nor visual field defect, and in such cases, prompt evaluation is recommended with referral to an \nophthalmologist as appropriate. \n \nPure Red Cell Aplasia \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All \npatients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease or \nconcomitant medications associated with PRCA. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThere is limited experience in non-Caucasian patients and patients at elevated immunological risk (e.g. \nretransplantation, evidence of panel reactive antibodies, PRA). \n \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nTacforius capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \nTacforius 5 mg capsules contain ponceau 4R. This may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised by hepatic CYP3A4. There is also evidence of \ngastrointestinal metabolism by CYP3A4 in the intestinal wall. Concomitant use of substances known \nto inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby increase or \ndecrease tacrolimus blood levels. \nIt is strongly recommended to closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, as well as, QT prolongation \n(with ECG), renal function and other side effects, whenever substances which have the potential to \nalter CYP3A4 metabolism or otherwise influence tacrolimus blood levels are used concomitantly, and \nto interrupt or adjust the tacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus \nexposure (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \n \nClinically the following substances have been shown to increase tacrolimus blood levels: \nStrong interactions have been observed with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and isavuconazole, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, \nand the combination of ombitasvir and paritaprevir with ritonavir, when used with and without \ndasabuvir), or the CMV antiviral letermovir, the pharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat, and the tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors nilotinib and imatinib. Concomitant use of these substances may require decreased \ntacrolimus doses in nearly all patients. Pharmacokinetics studies have indicated that the increase in \nblood levels is mainly a result of increase in oral bioavailability of tacrolimus owing to the inhibition \nof gastrointestinal metabolism. Effect on hepatic clearance is less pronounced. \nWeaker interactions have been observed with clotrimazole, clarithromycin, josamycin, nifedipine, \nnicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, danazol, ethinylestradiol, omeprazole, nefazodone and \n(Chinese) herbal remedies containing extracts of Schisandra sphenanthera. \nIn vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: \nbromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, \nmidazolam, nilvadipine, norethindrone, quinidine, tamoxifen, (triacetyl)oleandomycin. Grapefruit \njuice has been reported to increase the blood level of tacrolimus and should therefore be avoided. \nLansoprazole and ciclosporin may potentially inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tacrolimus and \nthereby increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. \n \nOther interactions potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \n \nTacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Possible interactions with other active substances \nknown to have high affinity for plasma proteins should be considered (e.g., NSAIDs, oral \nanticoagulants, or oral antidiabetics). \n \nOther potential interactions that may increase systemic exposure of tacrolimus include prokinetic \nagents (such as metoclopramide and cisapride), cimetidine and magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers potentially leading to decreased tacrolimus blood levels \n \nClinically the following substances have been shown to decrease tacrolimus blood levels: \nStrong interactions have been observed with rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) which may require increased tacrolimus doses in almost all patients. Clinically significant \ninteractions have also been observed with phenobarbital. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids have \nbeen shown to reduce tacrolimus blood levels. \n \nHigh dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone administered for the treatment of acute rejection have \nthe potential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels. \nCarbamazepine, metamizole and isoniazid have the potential to decrease tacrolimus concentrations. \n \nEffect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal products \n \nTacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor; thus concomitant use of tacrolimus with medicinal products \nknown to be metabolised by CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of such medicinal products. The \n\n\n\n10 \n\nhalf-life of ciclosporin is prolonged when tacrolimus is given concomitantly. In addition, \nsynergistic/additive nephrotoxic effects can occur. For these reasons, the combined administration of \nciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended and care should be taken when administering \ntacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nTacrolimus has been shown to increase the blood level of phenytoin. \nAs tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid-based contraceptives leading to increased hormone \nexposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures. \nLimited knowledge of interactions between tacrolimus and statins is available. Clinical data suggest \nthat the pharmacokinetics of statins are largely unaltered by the co-administration of tacrolimus. \nAnimal data have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearance and increase the half-\nlife of pentobarbital and antipyrine. \n \nMycophenolic acid. Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from \nciclosporin, which interferes with enterohepatic recirculation of mycophenolic acid, to tacrolimus, \nwhich is devoid of this effect, as this might result in changes of mycophenolic acid exposure. Active \nsubstances which interfere with mycophenolic acid's enterohepatic cycle have potential to reduce the \nplasma level and efficacy of mycophenolic acid. Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid \nmay be appropriate when switching from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa. \n \nOther interactions leading to clinically detrimental effects \n \nConcurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic \neffects may increase these effects (e.g., aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, \ncotrimoxazole, NSAIDs, ganciclovir or aciclovir). \nEnhanced nephrotoxicity has been observed following the administration of amphotericin B and \nibuprofen in conjunction with tacrolimus. \n \nAs tacrolimus treatment may be associated with hyperkalaemia, or may increase pre-existing \nhyperkalaemia, high potassium intake, or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or \nspironolactone) should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section \n4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nHuman data show that tacrolimus crosses the placenta. Limited data from organ transplant recipients \nshow no evidence of an increased risk of adverse reactions on the course and outcome of pregnancy \nunder tacrolimus treatment compared with other immunosuppressive medicinal products. However, \ncases of spontaneous abortion have been reported. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are \navailable. \nTacrolimus treatment can be considered in pregnant women, when there is no safer alternative and \nwhen the perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. In case of in utero exposure, \nmonitoring of the newborn for the potential adverse reactions of tacrolimus is recommended (in \nparticular effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (<37 week) (incidence of 66 \nof 123 births, i.e. 53.7%; however, data showed that the majority of the newborns had normal birth \nweight for their gestational age) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 of \n111 neonates, i.e. 7.2%) which, however normalises spontaneously. \nIn rats and rabbits, tacrolimus caused embryofoetal toxicity at doses which demonstrated maternal \ntoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nHuman data demonstrate that tacrolimus is excreted in breast milk. As detrimental effects on the \nnewborn cannot be excluded, women should not breast-feed whilst receiving Tacforius. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nFertility \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTacrolimus may cause visual and neurological disturbances. This effect may be enhanced if tacrolimus \nis administered in association with alcohol. \n \nNo studies on the effects of tacrolimus on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe adverse reaction profile associated with immunosuppressive agents is often difficult to establish \nowing to the underlying disease and the concurrent use of multiple medicinal products. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in >10% of patients) are tremor, renal \nimpairment, hyperglycaemic conditions, diabetes mellitus, hyperkalaemia, infections, hypertension \nand insomnia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nAs is well known for other potent immunosuppressive agents, patients receiving tacrolimus are \nfrequently at increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal). The course of pre-\nexisting infections may be aggravated. Both generalised and localised infections can occur. \nCases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules. \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of developing malignancies. \nBenign as well as malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and \nskin malignancies have been reported in association with tacrolimus treatment. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \ncommon: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, red blood cell analyses abnormal, \n\nleukocytosis \nuncommon:

electrocardiogram QT prolonged \n \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \ncommon: primary graft dysfunction \n \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed. A number of associated cases of \ntransplant rejection have been reported (frequency cannot be estimated from available data). \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nPain in extremity has been described in a number of published case reports as part of Calcineurin-\nInhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS). This typically presents as a bilateral and symmetrical, \nsevere, ascending pain in the lower extremities and may be associated with supra-therapeutic levels of \ntacrolimus. The syndrome may respond to tacrolimus dose reduction. In some cases, it was necessary \nto switch to alternative immunosuppression. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with overdose is limited. Several cases of accidental overdose have been reported with \ntacrolimus; symptoms have included tremor, headache, nausea and vomiting, infections, urticaria, \nlethargy and increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels. \nNo specific antidote to tacrolimus therapy is available. If overdose occurs, general supportive \nmeasures and symptomatic treatment should be conducted. \nBased on its high molecular weight, poor aqueous solubility, and extensive erythrocyte and plasma \nprotein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus will not be dialysable. In isolated patients with very \nhigh plasma levels, haemofiltration or -diafiltration have been effective in reducing toxic \nconcentrations. In cases of oral intoxication, gastric lavage and/or the use of adsorbents (such as \nactivated charcoal) may be helpful, if used shortly after intake. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAt the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus appear to be mediated by binding to a cytosolic \nprotein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of the compound. The \nFKBP12-tacrolimus complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, leading \nto a calcium-dependent inhibition of T-cell signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing \ntranscription of a discrete set of cytokine genes. \n \nTacrolimus is a highly potent immunosuppressive agent and has proven activity in both in vitro and in \nvivo experiments. \n \nIn particular, tacrolimus inhibits the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which are mainly responsible \nfor graft rejection. Tacrolimus suppresses T-cell activation and T-helper-cell dependent B-cell \nproliferation, as well as the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukins-2, -3, and γ-interferon) and \nthe expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. \n \nResults from clinical trials performed with once-daily tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules \n \nLiver transplantation \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules and tacrolimus immediate release \ncapsules, both in combination with corticosteroids, was compared in 471 de novo liver transplant \nrecipients. The event rate of biopsy confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\ntransplantation was 32.6% in the tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules group (N=237) and 29.3% in \nthe tacrolimus immediate release capsules group (N=234). The treatment difference (tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules – tacrolimus immediate release capsules) was 3.3% (95% confidence \ninterval [-5.7%, 12.3%]).The 12-month patient survival rates were 89.2% for tacrolimus prolonged-\nrelease capsules and 90.8% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules; in the tacrolimus prolonged-\nrelease capsules arm 25 patients died (14 female, 11 male) and in the tacrolimus immediate release \ncapsules arm 24 patients died (5 female, 19 male). 12-month graft survival was 85.3% for tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules and 85.6% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules. \n \nKidney transplantation \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules and tacrolimus immediate release \ncapsules, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, was compared \nin 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients. The event rate for biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within \nthe first 24 weeks after transplantation was 18.6% in the tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules group \n(N=331) and 14.9% in the tacrolimus immediate release capsules group (N=336). The treatment \ndifference (tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules - tacrolimus immediate release capsules) was 3.8% \n(95% confidence interval [-2.1%, 9.6%]). The 12-month patient survival rates were 96.9% for \ntacrolimus prolonged-release capsules and 97.5% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules; in the \ntacrolimus prolonged-release capsules arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the tacrolimus \nimmediate release capsules arm 8 patients died (3 female, 5 male). 12-month graft survival was 91.5% \nfor tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules and 92.8% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tacrolimus immediate release capsules, ciclosporin and tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules, all in combination with basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and \ncorticosteroids, was compared in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients. The incidence of efficacy \nfailure at 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, or lost to follow-\nup) was 14.0% in the tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules group (N=214), 15.1% in the tacrolimus \nimmediate release capsules group (N=212) and 17.0% in the ciclosporin group (N=212). The \ntreatment difference was -3.0% (tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules - ciclosporin) (95.2% \nconfidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules vs. ciclosporin and -\n1.9% (tacrolimus immediate release capsules - ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) \nfor tacrolimus immediate release capsules vs. ciclosporin. The 12 - month patient survival rates were \n98.6% for tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules, 95.7% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules \nand 97.6% for ciclosporin; in the tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules arm 3 patients died (all male), \nin the tacrolimus immediate release capsules arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the \nciclosporin arm 6 patients died (3 female, 3 male). 12 - month graft survival was 96.7% for tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules, 92.9% for tacrolimus immediate release capsules and 95.7% for \nciclosporin. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety of tacrolimus immediate release capsules bid in primary organ \ntransplantation \n \nIn prospective studies oral tacrolimus immediate release capsules was investigated as primary \nimmunosuppressant in approximately 175 patients following lung, 475 patients following pancreas \nand 630 patients following intestinal transplantation. Overall, the safety profile of oral tacrolimus \nimmediate release capsules in these published studies appeared to be similar to what was reported in \nthe large studies, where tacrolimus immediate release capsules was used as primary treatment in liver, \nkidney and heart transplantation. Efficacy results of the largest studies in each indication are \nsummarised below. \n \nLung transplantation \n \nThe interim analysis of a recent multicentre study using oral tacrolimus immediate release capsules \ndiscussed 110 patients who underwent 1:1 randomisation to either tacrolimus or ciclosporin. \nTacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg/day and \noral tacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/day. A lower incidence of acute \n\n\n\n16 \n\nrejection episodes for tacrolimus- versus ciclosporin-treated patients (11.5% versus 22.6%) and a \nlower incidence of chronic rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (2.86% versus 8.57%), was \nreported within the first year after transplantation. The 1 - year patient survival rate was 80.8% in the \ntacrolimus and 83% in the ciclosporin group. \n \nAnother randomised study included 66 patients on tacrolimus versus 67 patients on ciclosporin. \nTacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day and oral \ntacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day with subsequent dose adjustments to target \ntrough levels of 10 to 20 ng/ml. The 1 - year patient survival was 83% in the tacrolimus and 71% in \nthe ciclosporin group, the 2 - year survival rates were 76% and 66%, respectively. Acute rejection \nepisodes per 100 patient-days were numerically fewer in the tacrolimus (0.85 episodes) than in the \nciclosporin group (1.09 episodes). Obliterative bronchiolitis developed in 21.7% of patients in the \ntacrolimus group compared with 38.0% of patients in the ciclosporin group (p = 0.025). Significantly \nmore ciclosporin-treated patients (n = 13) required a switch to tacrolimus than tacrolimus-treated \npatients to ciclosporin (n = 2) (p = 0.02) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995;60:580). \n \nIn an additional two-centre study, 26 patients were randomised to the tacrolimus versus 24 patients to \nthe ciclosporin group. Tacrolimus was started as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of \n0.05 mg/kg/day and oral tacrolimus was administered at a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/day with \nsubsequent dose adjustments to target trough levels of 12 to 15 ng/ml. The 1 - year survival rates were \n73.1% in the tacrolimus versus 79.2% in the ciclosporin group. Freedom from acute rejection was \nhigher in the tacrolimus group at 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and at 1 year after lung \ntransplantation (50% versus 33.3%). \nThe three studies demonstrated similar survival rates. The incidences of acute rejection were \nnumerically lower with tacrolimus in all three studies and one of the studies reported a significantly \nlower incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with tacrolimus. \n \nPancreas transplantation \n \nA multicentre study using oral tacrolimus immediate release capsules included 205 patients \nundergoing simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation who were randomised to tacrolimus (n = \n103) or to ciclosporin (n = 102). The initial oral per protocol dose of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg/kg/day \nwith subsequent dose adjustments to target trough levels of 8 to 15 ng/ml by Day 5 and 5 to 10 ng/ml \nafter Month 6. Pancreas survival at 1 year was significantly superior with tacrolimus: 91.3% versus \n74.5% with ciclosporin (p < 0.0005), whereas renal graft survival was similar in both groups. In total \n34 patients switched treatment from ciclosporin to tacrolimus, whereas only 6 tacrolimus patients \nrequired alternative therapy. \n \nIntestinal transplantation \n \nPublished clinical experience from a single centre on the use of oral tacrolimus immediate release \ncapsules for primary treatment following intestinal transplantation showed that the actuarial survival \nrate of 155 patients (65 intestine alone, 75 liver and intestine, and 25 multivisceral) receiving \ntacrolimus and prednisone was 75% at 1 year, 54% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years. In the early years \nthe initial oral dose of tacrolimus was 0.3 mg/kg/day. Results continuously improved with increasing \nexperience over the course of 11 years. A variety of innovations, such as techniques for early detection \nof Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, the adjunct use of the \ninterleukin - 2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial tacrolimus doses with target trough levels of 10 to \n15 ng/ml, and most recently allograft irradiation were considered to have contributed to improved \nresults in this indication over time. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn man tacrolimus has been shown to be able to be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. \n\n\n\n17 \n\nAvailable tacrolimus is generally rapidly absorbed. Tacforius is a prolonged-release formulation of \ntacrolimus resulting in an extended oral absorption profile with an average time to maximum blood \nconcentration (Cmax) of approximately 2 hours (tmax). \n \nAbsorption is variable and the mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus (immediate release capsules \nformulation) is in the range of 20% - 25% (individual range in adult patients 6% - 43%). The oral \nbioavailability of tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules was reduced when it was administered after a \nmeal. Both the rate and extent of absorption of tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules were reduced \nwhen administered with food. \nBile flow does not influence the absorption of tacrolimus and therefore treatment with Tacforius may \ncommence orally. \n \nA strong correlation exists between AUC and whole blood trough levels at steady-state for tacrolimus \nprolonged-release capsules. Monitoring of whole blood trough levels therefore provides a good \nestimate of systemic exposure. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn man, the disposition of tacrolimus after intravenous infusion may be described as biphasic. \nIn the systemic circulation, tacrolimus binds strongly to erythrocytes resulting in an approximate 20:1 \ndistribution ratio of whole blood/plasma concentrations. In plasma, tacrolimus is highly bound (> \n98.8%) to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and α - 1-acid glycoprotein. \nTacrolimus is extensively distributed in the body. The steady-state volume of distribution based on \nplasma concentrations is approximately 1300 l (healthy subjects). Corresponding data based on whole \nblood averaged 47.6 l. \n \nMetabolism \n \nTacrolimus is widely metabolised in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 - 3A4. Tacrolimus is \nalso considerably metabolised in the intestinal wall. There are several metabolites identified. Only one \nof these has been shown in vitro to have immunosuppressive activity similar to that of tacrolimus. The \nother metabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive activity. In systemic circulation only one \nof the inactive metabolites is present at low concentrations. Therefore, metabolites do not contribute to \nthe pharmacological activity of tacrolimus. \n \nExcretion \n \nTacrolimus is a low-clearance substance. In healthy subjects, the average total body clearance \nestimated from whole blood concentrations was 2.25 l/h. In adult liver, kidney and heart transplant \npatients, values of 4.1 l/h, 6.7 l/h and 3.9 l/h, respectively, have been observed. Factors such as low \nhaematocrit and protein levels, which result in an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or \ncorticosteroid-induced increased metabolism, are considered to be responsible for the higher clearance \nrates observed following transplantation. \n \nThe half-life of tacrolimus is long and variable. In healthy subjects, the mean half-life in whole blood \nis approximately 43 hours. \n \nFollowing intravenous and oral administration of 14C-labelled tacrolimus, most of the radioactivity \nwas eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 2% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine. Less \nthan 1% of unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine and faeces, indicating that tacrolimus is \nalmost completely metabolised prior to elimination: bile being the principal route of elimination. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe kidneys and the pancreas were the primary organs affected in toxicity studies performed in rats \nand baboons. In rats, tacrolimus caused toxic effects to the nervous system and the eyes. Reversible \ncardiotoxic effects were observed in rabbits following intravenous administration of tacrolimus. \n\n\n\n18 \n\nWhen tacrolimus is administered intravenously as rapid infusion/bolus injection at a dose of 0.1 to \n1.0 mg/kg, QTc prolongation has been observed in some animal species. Peak blood concentrations \nachieved with these doses were above 150 ng/ml which is more than 6 - fold higher than mean peak \nconcentrations observed with tacrolimus prolonged-release capsules in clinical transplantation. \nEmbryofoetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits and was limited to doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. In rats, female reproductive function including birth was impaired at \ntoxic doses and the offspring showed reduced birth weights, viability and growth. \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm counts and motility was \nobserved in rats. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs and illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tacforius is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Tacforius \n3. How to take Tacforius \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tacforius \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tacforius is and what it is used for \n \nTacforius contains the active substance tacrolimus. It is an immunosuppressant. Following your organ \ntransplant (liver, kidney), your body’s immune system will try to reject the new organ. Tacforius is \nused to control your body’s immune response, enabling your body to accept the transplanted organ. \n \nYou may also be given Tacforius for an ongoing rejection of your transplanted liver, kidney, heart or \nother organ when any previous treatment you were taking was unable to control this immune response \nafter your transplantation. \n \nTacforius is used in adults. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tacforius \n \nDo not take Tacforius \n- if you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to sirolimus or to any macrolide-antibiotic (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\njosamycin). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTacrolimus immediate release capsules (e.g, Tacni) and Tacforius prolonged-release capsules both \ncontain the active substance, tacrolimus. However, Tacforius prolonged-release capsules are taken \nonce daily, whereas the immediate release capsules are taken twice daily. This is because Tacforius \ncapsules allow for a prolonged-release (more slow release over a longer period) of tacrolimus. \nTacforius prolonged-release capsules and tacrolimus immediate release capsules are not \ninterchangeable. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n- if you are taking any medicines mentioned below under “Other medicines and Tacforius”. \n- if you have or have had liver problems \n- if you have diarrhoea for more than one day \n- if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, \n\nfever, nausea or vomiting \n- if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called “QT prolongation”. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if during treatment you suffer from: \n- problems with your vision such as blurred vision, changes in colour vision, difficulty in seeing \n\ndetail or if your field of vision becomes restricted. \n \nYour doctor may need to adjust your dose of Tacforius. \n \nYou should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do \nblood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of Tacforius. \n \nYou should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Tacforius. This is \nbecause immunosuppressants could increase the risk of skin cancer. Wear appropriate protective \nclothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Tacforius is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Tacforius \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt is not recommended that Tacforius is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the \nprevention of transplant organ rejection). \n \nTacforius blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other \nmedicines can be affected by taking Tacforius, which may require interruption, an increase or a \ndecrease in Tacforius dose. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently \ntaken medicines like: \n- antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat \n\ninfections e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and \nisavuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, and rifampicin \n\n- letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus) \n- HIV protease inhibitors (e.g ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, \n\nand combination tablets, used to treat HIV infection \n- HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir and the combination \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir), used to treat hepatitis C infection \n- nilotinib and imatinib (used to treat certain cancers) \n- mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection \n- medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine) \n- antiemetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g. metoclopramide) \n- cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn \n- the contraceptive pill or other hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, hormone treatments \n\nwith danazol \n- medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g. nifedipine, nicardipine, \n\ndiltiazem and verapamil) \n- anti-arrhythmic medicines (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the \n\nheart) \n- medicines known as “statins” used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides \n- phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy \n\n\n\n34 \n\n- the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of \ncorticosteroids used to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g. in transplant \nrejection) \n\n- nefazodone, used to treat depression \n- Herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or extracts of \n\nSchisandra sphenanthera. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and \npain), amphotericin B (used to treat bacterial infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. \naciclovir). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems when taken together with Tacforius. \n \nYour doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for \nheart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and \npain, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take Tacforius. \n \nIf you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. \n \nTacforius with food and drink \nAvoid grapefruit (also as juice) while on treatment with Tacforius, since it can affect its levels in the \nblood. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \nTacrolimus passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using Tacforius. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly \nafter taking Tacforius. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. \n \nTacforius contains lactose \nTacforius contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nTacforius 5 mg capsules contains ponceau 4R \nTacforius 5 mg capsules contain ponceau 4R. This may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to take Tacforius \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \nThis medicine should only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in the treatment of \ntransplant patients. \n \nMake sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, \nunless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine. This \nmedicine should be taken once a day. If the appearance of this medicine is not the same as usual, or if \ndosage instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to make sure \nthat you have the right medicine. \n \nThe starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor \ncalculated according to your body weight. Initial daily doses just after transplantation will generally be \nin the range of \n \n\n0.10 - 0.30 mg per kg body weight per day \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \ndepending on the transplanted organ. When treating rejection, these same doses may be used. \n \nYour dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medication you \nare taking. \n \nFollowing the initiation of your treatment with Tacforius, frequent blood tests will be taken by your \ndoctor to define the correct dose. Afterwards regular blood tests by your doctor will be required to \ndefine the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually reduce your \nTacforius dose once your condition has stabilised. Your doctor will tell you exactly how many \ncapsules to take. \n \nYou will need to take Tacforius every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent \nrejection of your transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. \n \nTacforius is taken orally once daily in the morning. Take Tacforius on an empty stomach or 2 to \n3 hours after a meal. Wait at least 1 hour until the next meal. Take the capsules immediately following \nremoval from the blister. The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. \nDo not swallow the desiccant contained in the foil pouch. \n \nIf you take more Tacforius than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Tacforius \nIf you have forgotten to take your capsules in the morning, take them as soon as possible on the same \nday. Do not take a double dose the next morning. \n \nIf you stop taking Tacforius \nStopping your treatment with Tacforius may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ. \nDo not stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTacforius reduces your body’s defence mechanism (immune system), which will not be as good at \nfighting infections. Therefore, you may be more prone to infections while you are taking Tacforius. \n \nSevere effects may occur, including allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Benign and malignant \ntumours have been reported following Tacforius treatment. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (a very severe reduction in red blood cell counts), agranulocytosis (a \nseverely lowered number of white blood cells), haemolytic anaemia (decreased number of red blood \ncells due to abnormal breakdown) and febrile neutropenia (a decrease in the type of white blood cells \nwhich fight infection, accompanied by fever) have been reported. It is not known exactly how often \nthese side effects occur. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- Increased blood sugar, diabetes mellitus, increased potassium in the blood \n- Difficulty in sleeping \n- Trembling, headache \n- Increased blood pressure \n- Liver function tests abnormal \n\n\n\n36 \n\n- Diarrhoea, nausea \n- Kidney problems \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- Reduction in blood cell counts (platelets, red or white blood cells), increase in white blood cell \n\ncounts, changes in red blood cell counts (seen in blood tests) \n- Reduced magnesium, phosphate, potassium, calcium or sodium in the blood, fluid overload, \n\nincreased uric acid or lipids in the blood, decreased appetite, increased acidity of the blood, \nother changes in the blood salts (seen in blood tests) \n\n- Anxiety symptoms, confusion and disorientation, depression, mood changes, nightmare, \nhallucination, mental disorders \n\n- Fits, disturbances in consciousness, tingling and numbness (sometimes painful) in the hands and \nfeet, dizziness, impaired writing ability, nervous system disorders \n\n- Blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light, eye disorders \n- Ringing sound in your ears \n- Reduced blood flow in the heart vessels, faster heartbeat \n- Bleeding, partial or complete blocking of blood vessels, reduced blood pressure \n- Shortness in breath, disorders of the respiratory tissues in the lung, collection of liquid around \n\nthe lung, inflammation of the pharynx, cough, flu-like symptoms \n- Stomach problems such as inflammation or ulcer causing abdominal pain or diarrhoea, bleeding \n\nin the stomach, inflammation or ulcer in the mouth, collection of fluid in the belly, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, indigestion, constipation, passing wind, bloating, loose stools \n\n- Bile duct disorders, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems, liver tissue damage and \ninflammation of the liver \n\n- Itching, rash, hair loss, acne, increased sweating \n- Pain in joints, limbs, back and feet, muscle spasms \n- Insufficient function of the kidneys, reduced production of urine, impaired or painful urination \n- General weakness, fever, collection of fluid in your body, pain and discomfort, increase of the \n\nenzyme alkaline phosphatase in your blood, weight gain, feeling of temperature disturbed \n- Insufficient function of your transplanted organ \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- Changes in blood clotting, reduction in the number of all types of blood cells (seen in blood \n\ntests) \n- Dehydration, inability to urinate \n- Abnormal blood test results: reduced protein or sugar, increased phosphate, increase of the \n\nenzyme lactate dehydrogenase \n- Coma, bleeding in the brain, stroke, paralysis, brain disorder, speech and language \n\nabnormalities, memory problems \n- Clouding of the eye lens, impaired hearing \n- Irregular heartbeat, stop of heartbeat, reduced performance of your heart, disorder of the heart \n\nmuscle, enlargement of the heart muscle, stronger heartbeat, abnormal ECG, heart rate and \npulse abnormal \n\n- Blood clot in a vein of a limb, shock \n- Difficulties in breathing, respiratory tract disorders, asthma \n- Obstruction of the gut, increased blood level of the enzyme amylase, reflux of stomach content \n\nin your throat, delayed emptying of the stomach \n- Inflammation of the skin, burning sensation in the sunlight \n- Joint disorders \n- Painful menstruation and abnormal menstrual bleeding \n- Multiple organ failure, flu-like illness, increased sensitivity to heat and cold, feeling of pressure \n\non your chest, jittery or abnormal feeling, weight loss \n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n- Small bleedings in your skin due to blood clots \n- Increased muscle stiffness \n- Blindness, deafness \n\n\n\n37 \n\n- Collection of fluid around the heart \n- Acute breathlessness \n- Cyst formation in your pancreas \n- Problems with blood flow in the liver \n- Serious illness with blistering of skin, mouth, eyes and genitals; increased hairiness \n- Thirst, fall, feeling of tightness in your chest, decreased mobility, ulcer \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n- Muscular weakness \n- Abnormal heart scan \n- Liver failure \n- Painful urination with blood in the urine \n- Increase of fat tissue \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n- Abnormality of the optic nerve (optic neuropathy) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
