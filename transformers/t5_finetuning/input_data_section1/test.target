What Deferasirox Accord is Deferasirox Accord contains an active substance called deferasirox . It is an iron chelator which is a medicine used to remove the excess iron from the body ( also called iron overload ). It traps and removes excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools . What Deferasirox Accord is used for Repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia ( for example thalassaemia , sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS )). However , repeated blood transfusions can cause a build - up of excess iron . This is because blood contains iron and your body does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions . In patients with non - transfusion - dependent thalassaemia syndromes , iron overload may also develop over time , mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts . Over time , the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart . Medicines called iron chelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage . Deferasirox Accord is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older .
