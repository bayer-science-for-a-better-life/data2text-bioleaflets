See sections 4.4 and 5.1.\n\nd For treatment of S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is \u2264 1 mg/L, the standard dose is recommended.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nIntravenous use. Zinforo is administered by intravenous infusion over 5 to 60 minutes for standard \ndose or 120 minutes for high dose (for cSSTI caused by S. aureus with MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L to \nceftaroline) in infusion volumes of 50 mL, 100 mL or 250 mL (see section 6.6). Infusion related \nreactions (such as phlebitis) can be managed by prolonging the infusion duration.\n\nInfusion volumes for paediatric patients will vary according to the weight of the child. The infusion \nsolution concentration during preparation and administration should not exceed 12 mg/mL ceftaroline \nfosamil.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nHypersensitivity to the cephalosporin class of antibacterials.\nImmediate and severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam \nantibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and \nacute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with\nbeta-lactam antibiotics (including cephalosporins) treatment.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPatients who have a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins or other beta-lactam \nantibacterials may also be hypersensitive to ceftaroline fosamil. Ceftaroline should be used with \ncaution in patients with a history of non-severe hypersensitivity reactions to any other beta-lactam \nantibiotics (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems). If a severe allergic reaction or SCAR occurs during \ntreatment with Zinforo, the medicinal product should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.\n\nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea \nAntibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with ceftaroline \nfosamil and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider \nthis diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of \nceftaroline fosamil (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the discontinuation of therapy with \nceftaroline fosamil and the use of supportive measures together with the administration of specific \ntreatment for Clostridium difficile should be considered.\n\nNon-susceptible organisms\nSuperinfections may occur during or following treatment with Zinforo.\n\nPatients with pre-existing seizure disorder \nSeizures have occurred in toxicology studies at 7-25 times human ceftaroline Cmax levels (see\nsection 5.3). Clinical study experience with ceftaroline fosamil in patients with pre-existing seizure \ndisorders is very limited. Therefore, Zinforo should be used with caution in this patient population. \n\nDirect antiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic anaemia\nThe development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may occur during treatment with \ncephalosporins. The incidence of DAGT seroconversion in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil was \n11.2% in the five pooled pivotal studies with administration every 12 hours (600 mg administered over \n60 minutes every 12 hours) and 32.3% in a study in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil every \n8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours), (see section 4.8). In clinical studies \nthere was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT on treatment. \nHowever, the possibility that haemolytic anaemia may occur in association with cephalosporins \nincluding Zinforo treatment cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anaemia during or after \ntreatment with Zinforo should be investigated for this possibility.\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\nThere is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of CAP in the following patient groups: the \nimmunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, severe underlying lung disease, those \nwith PORT Risk Class V, and/or CAP requiring ventilation at presentation, CAP due to methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus or patients requiring intensive care. Caution is advised when treating such patients. \n\nThere is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of cSSTI in the following patient groups: the \nimmunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, perirectal abscess \nand patients with third degree and extensive burns. There is limited experience in treating patients with \ndiabetic foot infections. Caution is advised when treating such patients.\n\nThere are limited clinical trial data on the use of ceftaroline to treat cSSTI caused by S. aureus with an \nMIC of > 1 mg/L. The recommended dosages of Zinforo shown in Tables 1 to 4 for the treatment of \ncSSTI caused by S. aureus with ceftaroline MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L are based on pharmacokinetic-\npharmacodynamic modelling and simulation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Zinforo should not be used to \ntreat cSSTI due to S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is > 4 mg/L.\n\nThe recommended dosage of Zinforo shown in Table 2 for paediatric patients < 2 months of age are \nbased on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation.\n\nInfusion times of less than 60 minutes are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses \nonly.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil.\n\nThe interaction potential of ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil on medicinal products metabolised by \nCYP450 enzymes is expected to be low since they are not inhibitors nor inducers of CYP450 enzymes \nin vitro. Ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil are not metabolised by CYP450 enzymes in vitro, therefore \nco-administered CYP450 inducers or inhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of \nceftaroline.\n\nCeftaroline is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of renal uptake transporters (OCT2, OAT1, and \nOAT3) in vitro. Therefore, interactions of ceftaroline with medicinal products that are substrates or \ninhibitors (e.g. probenecid) of these transporters would not be expected.\n\nPaediatric population\nAs with adults, the interaction potential is expected to be low in paediatrics.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceftaroline fosamil in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies conducted in rat and rabbit do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \nat exposures similar to therapeutic concentrations. Following administration throughout pregnancy and \nlactation in the rat, there was no effect on pup birth weight or growth, although minor changes in \nfoetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed when ceftaroline \nfosamil was administered during organogenesis (see section 5.3). \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Zinforo during pregnancy unless the \nclinical condition of the woman requires treatment with an antibiotic with Zinforo\u2019s antibacterial \nprofile.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether ceftaroline fosamil or ceftaroline is excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Zinforo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThe effects of ceftaroline fosamil on fertility on humans have not been studied. Animal studies with \nceftaroline fosamil do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nUndesirable effects e.g. dizziness may occur and this may have an effect on the ability to drive and use \nof machines (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 3% of approximately 3242 patients treated with \nZinforo in clinical studies were diarrhoea, headache, nausea, and pruritus, and were generally mild or \nmoderate in severity.  Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) and severe hypersensitivity\nreactions may also occur.\n\nA greater incidence of rash in Asian patients (see below) and a greater incidence of DAGT \nseroconversion (see section 4.4) were observed in a study of adult patients with cSSTI conducted with \nZinforo 600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours.  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials and post-marketing \nexperience with Zinforo. Adverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and \nfrequency. Frequency categories are derived according to the following conventions: very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 5 Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class from clinical trials and post-\nmarketing experience\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nClostridium \ndifficile colitis (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nAnaemia, \nleucopenia, \nneutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, \nprothrombin time \n(PT) prolonged, \nactivated partial \nthromboplastin \ntime (aPTT) \nprolonged, \ninternational \nnormalized ratio \n(INR) increased\n\nAgranulocytosis, \neosinophilia\n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nRash, pruritus Anaphylaxis, \nhypersensitivity \n(e.g. urticaria, lip \nand face swelling) \n(see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4)\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nHeadache, \ndizziness\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nPhlebitis\n\n\n\n9\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare\n\nGastrointestin\nal disorders\n\nDiarrhoea, \nnausea, \nvomiting, \nabdominal \npain\n\nHepatobiliary\ndisorders\n\nIncreased \ntransaminases\n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders\n\nBlood creatinine\nincreased\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nPyrexia, \ninfusion site \nreactions \n(erythema, \nphlebitis, \npain)\n\nInvestigations Coombs \nDirect Test \nPositive \n(see \nsection 4.4)\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions\nSCARs (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and\nsystemic symptoms, acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) have been reported with beta-lactam \nantibiotics, including cephalosporins (see section 4.4).\n\nRash\nRash was observed at a common frequency in both the pooled Phase III studies in cSSTI with \nadministration of Zinforo every 12 hours (600 mg administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours) and \nthe study in cSSTI with administration every 8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every \n8 hours). However, the frequency of rash in the subgroup of Asian patients receiving Zinforo every \n8 hours was very common (18.5%).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which 227\npatients aged from 2 months to 17 years with cSSTI or CAP received Zinforo. Overall, the safety \nprofile in these 227 patients was similar to that observed in the adult population.\n\nIn addition, the safety assessment in neonates is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which \n34 patients (age range from birth to less than 60 days) received Zinforo; 23 of these patients received \nonly a single dose of Zinforo. Overall, the adverse events reported in these studies were consistent \nwith the known safety profile for Zinforo.\n\n\n\n10\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nLimited data in patients receiving higher than recommended Zinforo dosages show similar adverse \nreactions as observed in the patients receiving recommended dosages. Relative overdosing could occur \nin patients with moderate renal impairment. Treatment of overdose should follow standard medical \npractice;\n\nCeftaroline can be removed by haemodialysis; over a 4 hour dialysis period, approximately 74% of a \ngiven dose was recovered in the dialysate.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other cephalosporins and penems, ATC \ncode: J01DI02\n\nThe active moiety after Zinforo administration is ceftaroline.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCeftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial with in vitro activity against Gram-positive and -negative \nbacteria. The bactericidal action of ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-\nbinding proteins (PBPs). Biochemical studies have shown that ceftaroline has high affinity for PBP2a \nof methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and PBP2x of penicillin non-susceptible \nStreptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP).  As a result, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of \nceftaroline against a proportion of these organisms tested fall into the susceptible range (see \nResistance section below).\n\nResistance\n\nCeftaroline is not active against strains of Enterobacterales producing extended-spectrum beta-\nlactamases (ESBLs) from the TEM, SHV or CTX-M families, serine carbapenemases (such as KPC), \nclass B metallo-beta-lactamases or class C (AmpC) cephalosporinases. Organisms that express these \nenzymes and which are therefore resistant to ceftaroline occur at very variable rates between countries \nand between healthcare facilities within countries. If ceftaroline is commenced before susceptibility \ntest results are available then local information on the risk of encountering organisms that express \nthese enzymes should be taken into consideration. Resistance may also be mediated by bacterial \nimpermeability or drug efflux pump mechanisms. One or more of these mechanisms may co-exist in a \nsingle bacterial isolate.\n\nInteraction with other antibacterial agents\n\nIn vitro studies have not demonstrated any antagonism between ceftaroline in combination with other \ncommonly used antibacterial agents (e.g. amikacin, azithromycin, aztreonam, daptomycin, \nlevofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, tigecycline, and vancomycin).\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nThe European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints for \nsusceptibility testing are presented below.\n\nOrganisms MIC breakpoints (mg/L) \nSusceptible (\u2264 S) Resistant (R>)\n\nStaphylococcus aureus 11 22\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae 0.25 0.25\nStreptococcus Groups A, B, C, G Note3 Note3\n\nHaemophilus influenzae 0.03 0.03\nEnterobacterales 0.5 0.5\n\n1. Refers to dosing of adults or adolescents (from 12 years and 33 kg) with ceftaroline every 12 hours using 1-\nhour infusions (see section 4.2). Note that: There are no clinical trial data regarding the use of ceftaroline to \ntreat CAP due to S. aureus with ceftaroline MICs > 1 mg/L\n\n2. Refers to dosing of adults or adolescents (from 12 years and 33 kg) with ceftaroline every 8 hours using 2-\n\nhour infusions to treat cSSTI (see section 4.2). S. aureus with ceftaroline MICs \u2265 4 mg/L are rare. PK-PD \n\nanalyses suggest that dosing of adults or adolescents (from 12 years and 33 kg) with ceftaroline every 8 \n\nhours using 2-hour infusions may treat cSSTI due to S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is 4 mg/L.\n3. Infer susceptibility from susceptibility to benzylpenicillin.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\nAs with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the percent time above the minimum inhibitory \nconcentration (MIC) of the infecting organism over the dosing interval (%T > MIC) has been shown to \nbe the parameter that best correlates with the efficacy of ceftaroline.\n\nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens\nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed under each indication \nthat were susceptible to ceftaroline in vitro.\n\nComplicated skin and soft tissue infections\nGram-positive micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains)\n\uf0b7 Streptococcus pyogenes \n\uf0b7 Streptococcus agalactiae \n\uf0b7 Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus)\n\uf0b7 Streptococcus dysgalactiae \n\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Escherichia coli\n\uf0b7 Klebsiella pneumoniae \n\uf0b7 Klebsiella oxytoca \n\uf0b7 Morganella morganii \n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia\nNo cases of CAP due to MRSA were enrolled into the studies. The available clinical data cannot \nsubstantiate efficacy against penicillin non-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae.\n\nGram-positive micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Streptococcus pneumoniae\n\uf0b7 Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only)\n\n\n\n12\n\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Escherichia coli\n\uf0b7 Haemophilus influenzae \n\uf0b7 Haemophilus parainfluenzae \n\uf0b7 Klebsiella pneumoniae\n\nAntibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens\n\nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies \nsuggest that they would be susceptible to ceftaroline in the absence of acquired mechanisms of \nresistance:\n\nAnaerobic micro-organisms\nGram-positive micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Peptostreptococcus spp. \n\nGram-negative micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Fusobacterium spp.\n\nIn vitro data indicate that the following species are not susceptible to ceftaroline: \n\uf0b7 Chlamydophila spp.\n\uf0b7 Legionella spp.\n\uf0b7 Mycoplasma spp.\n\uf0b7 Proteus spp.\n\uf0b7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe Cmax and AUC of ceftaroline increase approximately in proportion to dose within the single dose \nrange of 50 to 1000 mg. No appreciable accumulation of ceftaroline is observed following multiple \nintravenous infusions of 600 mg every 8 or 12 hours in healthy adults with CrCL > 50 mL/min.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe plasma protein binding of ceftaroline is low (approximately 20%) and ceftaroline is not \ndistributed into erythrocytes. The median steady-state volume of distribution of ceftaroline in healthy \nadult males following a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil was \n20.3 l, similar to the volume of extracellular fluid.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nCeftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is converted into the active ceftaroline in plasma by phosphatase \nenzymes and concentrations of the prodrug are measurable in plasma primarily during intravenous \ninfusion. Hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of ceftaroline occurs to form the microbiologically \ninactive, open-ring metabolite, ceftaroline M-1. The mean plasma ceftaroline M-1 to ceftaroline AUC \nratio following a single 600 mg intravenous infusion of ceftaroline fosamil in healthy subjects is \napproximately 20-30%.\n\nIn pooled human liver microsomes, metabolic turnover was low for ceftaroline, indicating that \nceftaroline is not metabolised by hepatic CYP450 enzymes.\n\n\n\n13\n\nElimination\n\nCeftaroline is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Renal clearance of ceftaroline is approximately \nequal, or slightly lower than the glomerular filtration rate in the kidney, and in vitro transporter studies \nindicate that active secretion does not contribute to the renal elimination of ceftaroline.\n\nThe mean terminal elimination half-life of ceftaroline in healthy adults is approximately 2.5 hours.\n\nFollowing the administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil \nto healthy male adults, approximately 88% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 6% in faeces.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nDosage adjustments are required in adults, adolescents and children with CrCL \u2264 50 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nThere is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in adolescents with ESRD aged \nfrom 12 to < 18 years and with bodyweight < 33 kg and in children with ESRD aged from 2 to \n< 12 years. There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in paediatric patients\naged < 2 years with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in patients with hepatic impairment has not been established. As \nceftaroline does not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of \nceftaroline is not expected to be significantly affected by hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dosage \nadjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.\n\nElderly\nFollowing administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of ceftaroline fosamil, the \npharmacokinetics of ceftaroline were similar between healthy elderly subjects (\u2265 65 years of age), and \nhealthy young adult subjects (18-45 years of age). There was a 33% increase in AUC0-\u221e in the elderly \nthat was mainly attributable to age-related changes in renal function. Zinforo dose adjustment is not \nrequired in elderly patients with creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min.\n\nPaediatric population\nDose adjustments are required for neonates, infants, children and adolescents with bodyweight < 33 kg \n(see section 4.2). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe kidney was the primary target organ of toxicity in both the monkey and rat. Histopathologic \nfindings included pigment deposition and inflammation of the tubular epithelium. Renal changes were \nnot reversible but were reduced in severity following a 4 week recovery period.\n\nConvulsions have been observed at relatively high exposures during single and multi-dose studies in \nboth the rat and monkey (\u2265 7 times to the estimated ceftaroline Cmax level of a 600 mg twice a day).\n\nOther important toxicologic findings noted in the rat and monkey included histopathologic changes in \nthe bladder and spleen.\n\n\n\n14\n\nGenetic toxicology\nCeftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline were clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, \nhowever there was no evidence of mutagenic activity in an Ames test, mouse lymphoma and \nunscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Furthermore, in vivo micronucleus assays in rat and mouse were \nnegative. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nOverall, no adverse effects on fertility or post-natal development were observed in the rat at up to \n5 times the observed clinical exposure. When ceftaroline was administered during organogenesis, \nminor changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed in the \nrat at exposures below that observed clinically. However, when ceftaroline was administered \nthroughout pregnancy and lactation, there was no effect on pup weight or growth. Ceftaroline \nadministration to pregnant rabbits resulted in an increased foetal incidence of angulated hyoid alae, a \ncommon skeletal variation in rabbit fetuses, at exposures similar to those observed clinically.\n\nJuvenile toxicity\nIntravenous bolus dosing of ceftaroline fosamil to suckling rats from post-natal day 7 to 20 was well \ntolerated at plasma exposures approximately 2-fold higher than those for paediatric patients. Renal \ncortical cysts were oberved in all groups, including controls, on PND50. The cysts involved a small \nportion of the kidney and ocurred in the absence of significant changes in either renal function or \nurinary parameters. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse.\n\n6.

What Zinforo is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Zinforo is\nZinforo is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance ceftaroline fosamil. It belongs to a \ngroup of medicines called \u2018cephalosporin antibiotics.\u2019\n\nWhat Zinforo is used for\nZinforo is used to treat children (from birth) and adults with:\n\uf0b7 infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin\n\uf0b7 an infection of the lungs called \u2018pneumonia\u2019\n\nHow Zinforo works\nZinforo works by killing certain bacteria, which can cause serious infections.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Zinforo\n\nDo not use Zinforo:\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to ceftaroline fosamil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics\n\uf0b7 If you have had previous severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or \n\ncarbapenem. \n\nDo not use Zinforo if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse \nbefore using Zinforo.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo:\n\uf0b7 If you have kidney problems (your doctor may have to prescribe a lower dose)\n\uf0b7 If you have ever had fits (seizures or convulsions)\n\uf0b7 If you have ever had any non-severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or \n\ncarbapenem\n\n\n\n26\n\n\uf0b7 If you have had severe diarrhoea whilst taking antibiotics in the past\n\nYou may get another infection caused by another bacteria during or following treatment with Zinforo.\n\nYou may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions such as fever, joint pain, skin rash, red \nscaly rash, skin bumps that contain pus, blisters or peeling of skin, red circular patches often with \ncentral blisters on the trunk, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. If this happens talk to \nyour doctor or nurse immediately.\n\nLab Test\nYou may develop an abnormal lab test (called Coombs test) that looks for certain antibodies which \nmay act against your red blood cells. If the level of your red blood cells fall your doctor may check to \nsee if these antibodies have caused this.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using \nZinforo.\n\nOther medicines and Zinforo\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor before using Zinforo if you are pregnant. Do not use this medicine during pregnancy \nunless your doctor has told you to.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZinforo may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\n3. How to use Zinforo\n\nZinforo will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \n\nHow much to use\nThe usual recommended dose for adults is 600 mg every 12 hours. Your doctor may increase your \ndose to 600 mg every 8 hours for some infections. The usual recommended dose for children depends \non the age and weight of the child and is given every 8 or 12 hours. It is given as a drip into a vein \nlasting 5 to 60 minutes if you receive the usual dose or 120 minutes if you receive an increased dose. \n\nA course of treatment usually lasts for 5 to 14 days for skin infections and 5 to 7 days for pneumonia.\n\nPatients with kidney problems\nIf you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose because Zinforo is removed from your \nbody by the kidneys.\n\nIf you use more Zinforo than you should\nIf you think you have been given too much Zinforo, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.\n\nIf you miss a dose of Zinforo\nIf you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.\n\n\n\n27\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine:\n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get these symptoms as you may need urgent medical \ntreatment:\n\uf0b7 Sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue; a severe rash; and, swallowing or breathing \n\nproblems. These may be signs of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and may be life-\nthreatening;\n\n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea that becomes severe or does not go away or stool that contains blood or mucus during \nor after treatment with Zinforo. In this situation, you should not take medicines that stop or slow \nbowel movement.\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 Changes in a blood test called a \u2018Coombs test\u2019 commonly seen in patients receiving this type of \n\nantibiotic.

The contents of Zinforo vial \nshould be reconstituted with 20 mL of sterile water for injections. Instructions for the reconstitution of \nZinforo vial are summarized below:\n\nDosage strength\n(mg)\n\nVolume of diluent\nto be added\n\n(mL)\n\nApproximate ceftaroline \nconcentration\n\n(mg/mL)\n\nAmount to be \nwithdrawn\n\n600 20 30 Total volume\n\nThe reconstituted solution must be further diluted to produce Zinforo solution for infusion. A 250 mL, \n100 mL or 50 mL infusion bag can be used to prepare the infusion, based on the patient\u2019s volume \nrequirements. Appropriate infusion diluents include: sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection, dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL and dextrose \n25 mg/mL solution for injection (0.45% sodium chloride and 2.5% dextrose) or Lactated Ringer\u2019s \nsolution. The resulting solution should be administered according to the dose selected over 5 to\n60 minutes for standard dose or 120 minutes for high dose in infusion volumes of 50 mL, 100 mL or \n250 mL.\n\nInfusion volumes for paediatric patients will vary according to the weight of the child. The infusion \nsolution concentration during preparation and administration should not exceed 12 mg/mL ceftaroline \nfosamil.\n\nReconstitution time is less than 2 minutes. Mix gently to reconstitute and check to see that the contents \nhave dissolved completely. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter \nprior to administration.\n\nThe colour of Zinforo infusion solutions ranges from clear, light to dark yellow depending on the \nconcentration and storage conditions. It is free of any particles. When stored as recommended, the \nproduct potency is not affected.\n\nStudies have shown that Zinforo solutions for infusion are stable for up to 6 hours at room \ntemperature. Alternatively they are stable for up to 24 hours under refrigerated storage. Once removed\nfrom refrigeration to room temperature, the diluted product must be used within 6 hours.\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately unless \nreconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.\n\nThe compatibility of Zinforo with other medicines has not been established. Zinforo should not be \nmixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs.\n\nEach vial is for single use only. \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
