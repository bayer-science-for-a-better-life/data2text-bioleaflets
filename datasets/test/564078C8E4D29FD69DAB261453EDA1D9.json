NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nTovanor Breezhaler 44 micrograms inhalation powder, hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach capsule contains 63 micrograms of glycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 50 micrograms of \n\nglycopyrronium. \n\n \n\nEach delivered dose (the dose that leaves the mouthpiece of the inhaler) contains 55 micrograms of \n\nglycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 44 micrograms of glycopyrronium. \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\nEach capsule contains 23.6 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nInhalation powder, hard capsule (inhalation powder). \n\n \n\nTransparent orange capsules containing a white powder, with the product code \u201cGPL50\u201d printed in \n\nblack above and the company logo ( ) printed in black below a black bar. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTovanor Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in \n\nadult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is the inhalation of the content of one capsule once daily using the Tovanor \n\nBreezhaler inhaler. \n\n \n\nTovanor Breezhaler is recommended to be administered, at the same time of the day each day. If a \n\ndose is missed, the next dose should be taken as soon as possible. Patients should be instructed not to \n\ntake more than one dose in a day. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population \n\nTovanor Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (75 years of age and \n\nolder) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nTovanor Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis \n\nTovanor Breezhaler should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk since the \n\nsystemic exposure to glycopyrronium may be increased in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is \n\npredominantly cleared by renal excretion and therefore no major increase in exposure is expected in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Tovanor Breezhaler in the paediatric population (under 18 years) in the \n\nindication COPD. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor inhalation use only. \n\n \n\nThe capsules must be administered only using the Tovanor Breezhaler inhaler (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nThe capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. \n\n \n\nThe capsules must not be swallowed. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed on how to administer the medicinal product correctly. Patients who do \n\nnot experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicinal \n\nproduct rather than inhaling it. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nNot for acute use \n\nTovanor Breezhaler is a once-daily, long-term maintenance treatment and is not indicated for the \n\ninitial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, i.e. as a rescue therapy. \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Tovanor Breezhaler. If \n\nsigns suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing \n\nor swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips, and face), urticaria or skin rash, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. \n\n \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm \n\nIn clinical studies with Tovanor Breezhaler, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed. However, \n\nparadoxical bronchospasm has been observed with other inhalation therapy and can be \n\nlife-threatening. If this occurs, treatment should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy \n\ninstituted. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic effect \n\nTovanor Breezhaler should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary \n\nretention. \n\n \n\nPatients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma and \n\nshould be informed to stop using Tovanor Breezhaler and to contact their doctor immediately should \n\nany of these signs or symptoms develop. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment \n\nA moderate mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold was seen in subjects \n\nwith mild and moderate renal impairment and up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment \n\nand end-stage renal disease. In patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration \n\nrate below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \n\nTovanor Breezhaler should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). These patients should be monitored closely for potential adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of cardiovascular disease \n\nPatients with unstable ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, history of myocardial infarction, \n\narrhythmia (excluding chronic stable atrial fibrillation), a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc \n\n(Fridericia method) was prolonged (>450 ms for males or >470 ms for females) were excluded from \n\nthe clinical trials, and therefore the experience in these patient groups is limited. Tovanor Breezhaler \n\nshould be used with caution in these patient groups. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\n\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThe co-administration of Tovanor Breezhaler with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products \n\nhas not been studied and is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nAlthough no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, Tovanor Breezhaler has been used \n\nconcomitantly with other medicinal products commonly used in the treatment of COPD without \n\nclinical evidence of drug interactions. These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, \n\nmethylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, cimetidine, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is \n\nthought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to \n\nglycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these \n\nchanges, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when glycopyrronium is co-administered \n\nwith cimetidine or other inhibitors of organic cation transport. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of glycopyrronium and orally inhaled indacaterol, a beta2-adrenergic \n\nagonist, under steady-state conditions of both active substances did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\neither medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of Tovanor Breezhaler in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \n\nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nGlycopyrronium should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether glycopyrronium bromide is excreted in human milk. However, glycopyrronium \n\nbromide (including its metabolites) was excreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The use \n\nof glycopyrronium by breast-feeding women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the \n\nwoman is greater than any possible risk to the infant (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nReproduction studies and other data in animals do not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either \n\nmales or females (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most common anticholinergic adverse reaction was dry mouth (2.4%). The majority of the reports \n\nof dry mouth were suspected to be related to the medicinal product and were mild, with none being \n\nsevere. \n\n \n\nThe safety profile is further characterised by other symptoms related to the anticholinergic effects, \n\nincluding signs of urinary retention, which were uncommon. Gastrointestinal effects including \n\ngastroenteritis and dyspepsia were also observed. Adverse reactions related to local tolerability \n\nincluded throat irritation, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions reported during the first six months of two pooled pivotal Phase III trials of 6 and \n\n12 months duration are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 1). Within each system organ \n\nclass, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within \n\neach frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In \n\naddition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following \n\nconvention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n\n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions \n \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency category \n\nInfections and infestations  \n\nNasopharyngitis1) Common \n\nRhinitis Uncommon \n\nCystitis Uncommon \n\n  \n\nImmune system disorders  \n\nHypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nAngioedema2) Uncommon \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\nHyperglycaemia Uncommon \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  \n\nInsomnia Common \n\n  \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\nHeadache3) Common \n\nHypoaesthesia Uncommon \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nAtrial fibrillation Uncommon \n\nPalpitations Uncommon \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nAdverse reactions Frequency category \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  \n\nSinus congestion Uncommon \n\nProductive cough Uncommon \n\nThroat irritation Uncommon \n\nEpistaxis Uncommon \n\nDysphonia2) Uncommon \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm2) Not known \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nDry mouth Common \n\nGastroenteritis Common \n\nNausea2) Uncommon \n\nVomiting1) 2) Uncommon \n\nDyspepsia Uncommon \n\nDental caries Uncommon \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n\nRash Uncommon \n\nPruritus2) Uncommon \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \n\nMusculoskeletal pain1) 2) Common \n\nPain in extremity Uncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal chest pain Uncommon \n\n  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  \n\nUrinary tract infection3) Common \n\nDysuria Uncommon \n\nUrinary retention Uncommon \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions  \n\nFatigue Uncommon \n\nAsthenia Uncommon \n\n1) More frequent for glycopyrronium than placebo in the 12 months database only. \n\n2) Reports have been received from post-approval marketing experience in association with the use of \n\nTovanor Breezhaler. These were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and it is \n\ntherefore not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to \n\ndrug exposure. Therefore the frequency was calculated from clinical trial experience. \n\n3) Seen more frequently for glycopyrronium than placebo in elderly >75 years only. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn the pooled 6-month database the frequency of dry mouth was 2.2% versus 1.1%, of insomnia 1.0% \n\nversus 0.8%, and of gastroenteritis 1.4% versus 0.9%, for Tovanor Breezhaler and placebo \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nDry mouth was reported mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with a median duration of four \n\nweeks in the majority of patients. However in 40% of cases symptoms continued for the entire 6-\n\nmonth period. No new cases of dry mouth were reported in months 7-12. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nHigh doses of glycopyrronium may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms for which \n\nsymptomatic treatment may be indicated. \n\n \n\nAcute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of Tovanor Breezhaler capsules is unlikely due to the \n\nlow oral bioavailability (about 5%). \n\n \n\nPeak plasma levels and total systemic exposure following intravenous administration of \n\n150 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide (equivalent to 120 micrograms glycopyrronium) in healthy \n\nvolunteers were respectively about 50-fold and 6-fold higher than the peak and total exposure at \n\nsteady-state achieved with the recommended dose (44 micrograms once daily) of Tovanor Breezhaler \n\nand were well tolerated. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, anticholinergics, ATC code: \n\nR03BB06 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nGlycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for \n\nonce-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of COPD. Parasympathetic nerves are the major \n\nbronchoconstrictive neural pathway in airways, and cholinergic tone is the key reversible component \n\nof airflow obstruction in COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of \n\nacetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium bromide is a high affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist. A greater than 4-fold \n\nselectivity for the human M3 receptors over the human M2 receptor has been demonstrated using \n\nradioligand binding studies. It has a rapid onset of action as evidenced by observed receptor \n\nassociation/dissociation kinetic parameters and the onset of action after inhalation in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nThe long duration of action can be partly attributed to sustained concentrations of active substance in \n\nthe lung as reflected by the prolonged terminal elimination half-life of glycopyrronium after inhalation \n\nvia the Tovanor Breezhaler inhaler in contrast to the half life after intravenous administration (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nThe clinical Phase III development programme included two phase III studies: a 6-month \n\nplacebo-controlled study and a 12-month placebo and active-controlled (open label tiotropium \n\n18 micrograms once daily) study, both in patients with clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. \n\n \n\nEffects on lung function \n\nTovanor Breezhaler 44 micrograms once daily provided consistently statistically significant \n\nimprovement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV1, forced vital capacity, \n\nFVC, and inspiratory capacity, IC) in a number of clinical studies. In phase III studies, bronchodilator \n\neffects were seen within 5 minutes after the first dose and were maintained over the 24-hour dosing \n\ninterval from the first dose. There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over time in the 6- \n\nand 12-month studies. The magnitude of the effect was dependent on the degree of reversibility of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nairflow limitation at baseline (tested by administration of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist \n\nbronchodilator): Patients with the lowest degree of reversibility at baseline (<5%) generally exhibited \n\na lower bronchodilator response than patients with a higher degree of reversibility at baseline (\u22655%). \n\nAt 12 weeks (primary endpoint), Tovanor Breezhaler increased trough FEV1 by 72 ml in patients with \n\nthe lowest degree of reversibility (<5%) and by 113 ml in those patients with a higher degree of \n\nreversibility at baseline (\u22655%) compared to placebo (both p<0.05). \n\n \n\nIn the 6-month study, Tovanor Breezhaler increased FEV1 after the first dose with an improvement of \n\n93 ml within 5 minutes and 144 ml within 15 minutes of dosing, compared to placebo (both p<0.001). \n\nIn the 12-month study, the improvements were 87 ml at 5 minutes and 143 ml at 15 minutes (both \n\np<0.001). In the 12-month study, Tovanor Breezhaler produced statistically significant improvements \n\nin FEV1 compared to tiotropium in the first 4 hours after dosing on day 1 and at week 26, and \n\nnumerically greater values for FEV1 in the first 4 hours after dosing than tiotropium at week 12 and \n\nweek 52. \n\n \n\nThe values for FEV1 at the end of the dosing interval (24 h post dose) were similar between the first \n\ndose and those seen after 1 year of dosing. At 12 weeks (primary endpoint), Tovanor Breezhaler \n\nincreased trough FEV1 by 108 ml in the 6-month study and by 97 ml in the 12-month study compared \n\nto placebo (both p<0.001). In the 12-month study, the improvement versus placebo for tiotropium was \n\n83 ml (p<0.001). \n\n \n\nSymptomatic outcomes \n\nTovanor Breezhaler administered at 44 micrograms once daily statistically significantly reduced \n\nbreathlessness as evaluated by the Transitional Dyspnoea Index (TDI). In a pooled analysis of the 6- \n\nand 12-month pivotal studies a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients receiving \n\nTovanor Breezhaler responded with a 1 point or greater improvement in the TDI focal score at \n\nweek 26 compared to placebo (58.4% and 46.4% respectively, p<0.001). These findings were similar \n\nto those seen in patients receiving tiotropium, 53.4% of whom responded with 1 point or greater \n\nimprovement (p=0.009 compared to placebo). \n\n \n\nTovanor Breezhaler once daily has also shown a statistically significant effect on health-related quality \n\nof life measured using the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). A pooled analysis of the \n\n6- and 12-month pivotal studies found a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients \n\nreceiving Tovanor Breezhaler responded with a 4 point or greater improvement in SGRQ compared to \n\nplacebo at week 26 (57.8% and 47.6% respectively, p<0.001). For patients receiving tiotropium, \n\n61.0% responded with a 4 point or greater improvement in SGRQ (p=0.004 compared to placebo). \n\n \n\nCOPD exacerbations reduction \n\nCOPD exacerbation data was collected in the 6- and 12\u2013month pivotal studies. In both studies, the \n\npercentage of patients experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation (defined as requiring treatment \n\nwith systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalisation) was reduced. In the 6-month study, \n\nthe percentage of patients experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation was 17.5% for Tovanor \n\nBreezhaler and 24.2% for placebo (Hazard ratio: 0.69, p=0.023), and in the 12-month study it was \n\n32.8% for Tovanor Breezhaler and 40.2% for placebo (Hazard ratio: 0.66, p=0.001). In a pooled \n\nanalysis of the first 6 months of treatment in the 6- and 12-month studies, compared to placebo \n\nTovanor Breezhaler statistically significantly prolonged time to first moderate or severe exacerbation \n\nand reduced the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations (0.53 exacerbations/year versus \n\n0.77exacerbations /year, p<0.001). The pooled analysis also showed fewer patients treated with \n\nTovanor Breezhaler than with placebo experienced an exacerbation requiring hospitalisation (1.7% \n\nversus 4.2%, p=0.003). \n\n \n\nOther effects \n\nTovanor Breezhaler once daily statistically significantly reduced the use of rescue medication \n\n(salbutamol) by 0.46 puffs per day (p=0.005) over 26 weeks and by 0.37 puffs per day (p=0.039) over \n\n52 weeks, compared to placebo for the 6- and 12-month studies, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nIn a 3-week study where exercise tolerance was tested via cycle ergometer at submaximal (80%) \n\nworkload (submaximal exercise tolerance test), Tovanor Breezhaler, dosed in the morning, reduced \n\ndynamic hyperinflation and improved the length of time exercise could be maintained from the first \n\ndose onwards. On the first day of treatment inspiratory capacity under exercise was improved by \n\n230 ml and exercise endurance time was improved by 43 seconds (an increase of 10%) compared to \n\nplacebo. After three weeks of treatment the improvement in inspiratory capacity with Tovanor \n\nBreezhaler was similar to the first day (200 ml), exercise endurance time however had increased by \n\n89 seconds (an increase of 21%) compared to placebo. Tovanor Breezhaler was found to decrease \n\ndyspnoea and leg discomfort when exercising as measured using Borg scales. Tovanor Breezhaler also \n\nreduced dyspnoea at rest measured using the Transitional Dyspnoea Index. \n\n \n\nSecondary pharmacodynamic effects \n\nNo change in mean heart rate or QTc interval was observed with Tovanor Breezhaler in doses up to \n\n176 micrograms in COPD patients. In a thorough QT study in 73 healthy volunteers, a single inhaled \n\ndose of glycopyrronium 352 micrograms (8 times the therapeutic dose) did not prolong the QTc \n\ninterval and slightly reduced heart rate (maximal effect -5.9 bpm; average effect over \n\n24 hours -2.8 bpm) when compared to placebo. The effect on heart rate and QTc interval of \n\n150 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide (equivalent to 120 micrograms glycopyrronium) \n\nadministered intravenously was investigated in young healthy subjects. Peak exposures (Cmax) about \n\n50-fold higher than after inhalation of glycopyrronium 44 micrograms at steady state were achieved \n\nand did not result in tachycardia or QTc prolongation. A slight reduction in heart rate (mean difference \n\nover 24 h -2 bpm when compared to placebo), which is a known effect of low exposures to \n\nanticholinergic compounds in young healthy subjects, was observed. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nTovanor Breezhaler in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral inhalation using the Tovanor Breezhaler inhaler, glycopyrronium was rapidly absorbed \n\nand reached peak plasma levels at 5 minutes post dose. \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of glycopyrromium inhaled via Tovanor Breezhaler was estimated to be \n\nabout 45% of the delivered dose. About 90% of systemic exposure following inhalation is due to lung \n\nabsorption and 10% is due to gastrointestinal absorption. \n\n \n\nIn patients with COPD, pharmacokinetic steady-state of glycopyrronium was reached within one week \n\nof the start of treatment. The steady-state mean peak and trough plasma concentrations of \n\nglycopyrronium for a 44 micrograms once-daily dosing regimen were 166 picograms/ml and \n\n8 picograms/ml, respectively. Steady-state exposure to glycopyrronium (AUC over the 24-hour dosing \n\ninterval) was about 1.4- to 1.7-fold higher than after the first dose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nAfter intravenous dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution of glycopyrronium was 83 litres and \n\nthe volume of distribution in the terminal phase was 376 litres. The apparent volume of distribution in \n\nthe terminal phase following inhalation was almost 20-fold larger, which reflects the much slower \n\nelimination after inhalation. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of glycopyrronium was 38% \n\nto 41% at concentrations of 1 to 10 nanograms/ml. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nIn vitro metabolism studies showed consistent metabolic pathways for glycopyrronium bromide \n\nbetween animals and humans. Hydroxylation resulting in a variety of mono-and bis-hydroxylated \n\nmetabolites and direct hydrolysis resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid derivative (M9) were \n\nseen. In vivo, M9 is formed from the swallowed dose fraction of inhaled glycopyrronium bromide. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nGlucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of glycopyrronium were found in urine of humans after \n\nrepeated inhalation, accounting for about 3% of the dose. \n\n \n\nMultiple CYP isoenzymes contribute to the oxidative biotransformation of glycopyrronium. Inhibition \n\nor induction of the metabolism of glycopyrronium is unlikely to result in a relevant change of systemic \n\nexposure to the active substance. \n\n \n\nIn vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that glycopyrronium bromide has no relevant capacity to \n\ninhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5, the \n\nefflux transporters MDR1, MRP2 or MXR, and the uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2. In vitro \n\nenzyme induction studies did not indicate a clinically relevant induction by glycopyrronium bromide \n\nfor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, or for UGT1A1 and the transporters MDR1 and MRP2. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAfter intravenous administration of [3H]-labelled glycopyrronium bromide to humans, the mean \n\nurinary excretion of radioactivity in 48 hours amounted to 85% of the dose. A further 5% of the dose \n\nwas found in the bile. \n\n \n\nRenal elimination of parent drug accounts for about 60 to 70% of total clearance of systemically \n\navailable glycopyrronium whereas non-renal clearance processes account for about 30 to 40%. Biliary \n\nclearance contributes to the non-renal clearance, but the majority of non-renal clearance is thought to \n\nbe due to metabolism. \n\n \n\nMean renal clearance of glycopyrronium following inhalation was in the range of 17.4 and \n\n24.4 litres/h. Active tubular secretion contributes to the renal elimination of glycopyrronium. Up to \n\n23% of the delivered dose was found in urine as parent drug. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium plasma concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner. The mean terminal \n\nelimination half-life was much longer after inhalation (33 to 57 hours) than after intravenous \n\n(6.2 hours) and oral (2.8 hours) administration. The elimination pattern suggests sustained lung \n\nabsorption and/or transfer of glycopyrronium into the systemic circulation at and beyond 24 hours \n\nafter inhalation. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nIn COPD patients both systemic exposure and total urinary excretion of glycopyrronium at \n\npharmacokinetic steady state increased about dose-proportionally over the dose range of 44 to \n\n176 micrograms. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in COPD patients identified body weight and age as \n\nfactors contributing to inter-patient variability in systemic exposure. Tovanor Breezhaler \n\n44 micrograms once daily can be safely used in all age and body weight groups. \n\n \n\nGender, smoking status and baseline FEV1 had no apparent effect on systemic exposure. \n\n \n\nThere were no major differences in total systemic exposure (AUC) between Japanese and Caucasian \n\nsubjects following inhalation of glycopyrronium bromide. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data is \n\navailable for other ethnicities or races. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nClinical studies have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Glycopyrronium is \n\ncleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion. Impairment of the hepatic \n\nmetabolism of glycopyrronium is not thought to result in a clinically relevant increase of systemic \n\nexposure. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nRenal impairment has an impact on the systemic exposure to glycopyrronium bromide. A moderate \n\nmean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold was seen in subjects with mild and \n\nmoderate renal impairment and up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment and end-stage \n\nrenal disease. In COPD patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular \n\nfiltration rate, eGFR \u226530 ml/min/1.73 m2) Tovanor Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage \n\nrenal disease requiring dialysis, Tovanor Breezhaler should only be used if the expected benefit \n\noutweighs the potential risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\nEffects attributable to the muscarinic receptor antagonist properties of glycopyrronium bromide \n\nincluded mild to moderate increases in heart rate in dogs, lens opacities in rats and, reversible changes \n\nassociated with reduced glandular secretions in rats and dogs. Mild irritancy or adaptive changes in the \n\nrespiratory tract were seen in rats. All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of \n\nthose anticipated in humans. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits following inhalation administration. Fertility \n\nand pre- and post-natal development were not affected in rats. Glycopyrronium bromide and its \n\nmetabolites did not significantly cross the placental barrier of pregnant mice, rabbits and dogs. \n\nGlycopyrronium bromide (including its metabolites) was excreted into the milk of lactating rats and \n\nreached up to 10-fold higher concentrations in the milk than in the blood of the dam. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential for glycopyrronium \n\nbromide. Carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice using oral administration and in rats using \n\ninhalation administration revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity at systemic exposures (AUC) of \n\napproximately 53-fold higher in mice and 75-fold higher in rats than the maximum recommended dose \n\nof 44 micrograms once daily for humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tovanor Breezhaler is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Tovanor Breezhaler is \n\nThis medicine contains an active substance called glycopyrronium bromide. This belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called bronchodilators. \n\n \n\nWhat Tovanor Breezhaler is used for \n\nThis medicine is used to make breathing easier for adult patients who have breathing difficulties due to \n\na lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\n \n\nIn COPD the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes breathing difficult. This medicine blocks \n\nthe tightening of these muscles in the lungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. \n\n \n\nIf you use this medicine once a day, it will help to reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Tovanor Breezhaler \n \n\nDo not use Tovanor Breezhaler \n- if you are allergic to glycopyrronium bromide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Tovanor Breezhaler, if any of the following applies to you: \n\n- you have kidney problems. \n- you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. \n- you have difficulty passing urine. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nDuring treatment with Tovanor Breezhaler, stop taking this medicine and tell your doctor \n\nimmediately: \n\n- if you experience tightness of the chest, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness immediately after \nusing Tovanor Breezhaler (signs of bronchospasm). \n\n- if you experience difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips or face, \nskin rash, itching and hives (signs of allergic reaction). \n\n- if you experience eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured \nimages in association with red eyes. These may be signs of an acute attack of narrow-angle \n\nglaucoma. \n\n \n\nTovanor Breezhaler is used as a maintenance treatment for your COPD. Do not use this medicine to \n\ntreat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children or adolescents below the age of 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tovanor Breezhaler \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.
