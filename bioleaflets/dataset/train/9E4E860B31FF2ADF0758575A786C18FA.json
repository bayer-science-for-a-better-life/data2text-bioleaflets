CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nOtezla, alone or in combination with Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), is \nindicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have had an \ninadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy (see section 5.1).  \n \nPsoriasis \n \nOtezla is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients \nwho failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy \nincluding cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA).  \n \nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease \n \nOtezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease \n(BD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Otezla should be initiated by specialists experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \npsoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of apremilast is 30 mg taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart \n(morning and evening), with no food restrictions. An initial titration schedule is required as shown \nbelow in Table 1. No re-titration is required after initial titration. \n \nTable 1. Dose titration schedule \nDay 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 & \n\nthereafter\nAM AM PM AM PM AM PM AM PM AM PM\n\n10 mg 10 mg 10 mg 10 mg 20 mg 20 mg 20 mg 20 mg 30 mg 30 mg 30 mg\n \nIf patients miss a dose, the next dose should be taken as soon as possible. If it is close to the time for \ntheir next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and the next dose should be taken at the regular \ntime. \n \nDuring pivotal trials the greatest improvement was observed within the first 24 weeks of treatment for \nPsA and PSOR and within the first 12 weeks of treatment for BD. If a patient shows no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit after this time period, treatment should be reconsidered. The patient's response to \ntreatment should be evaluated on a regular basis. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required for this patient population (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. The dose of \napremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance of less than 30 mL per minute estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation). For initial dose \n\n\n\n4 \n\ntitration in this group, it is recommended that apremilast be titrated using only the AM schedule listed \nin Table 1 and the PM doses be skipped (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of apremilast in children aged 0 to 17 years have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOtezla is for oral use. The film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole, and can be taken either with \nor without food.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDiarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of severe diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting associated with the \nuse of apremilast. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, \npatients were hospitalised. Patients 65 years of age or older may be at a higher risk of complications. If \npatients develop severe diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting, discontinuation of treatment with apremilast \nmay be necessary. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nApremilast is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia and \ndepression. Instances of suicidal ideation and behaviour, including suicide, have been observed in \npatients with or without history of depression (see section 4.8). The risks and benefits of starting or \ncontinuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if patients report previous or \nexisting psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant treatment with other medicinal products likely to \ncause psychiatric events is intended. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to notify the \nprescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation. If patients suffered from \nnew or worsening psychiatric symptoms, or suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt is identified, it is \nrecommended to discontinue treatment with apremilast.  \n \nSevere renal impairment \n \nOtezla should be dose reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nUnderweight patients \n \nPatients who are underweight at the start of treatment should have their body weight monitored \nregularly. In the event of unexplained and clinically significant weight loss, these patients should be \nevaluated by a medical practitioner and discontinuation of treatment should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nLactose content \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCo-administration of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme inducer, rifampicin, resulted in \na reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of apremilast. \nTherefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, \nphenytoin and St. John\u2019s Wort) with apremilast is not recommended. Co-administration of apremilast \nwith multiple doses of rifampicin resulted in a decrease in apremilast area-under-the-concentration \ntime curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) by approximately 72% and 43%, \nrespectively. Apremilast exposure is decreased when administered concomitantly with strong inducers \nof CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin) and may result in reduced clinical response.  \n \nIn clinical studies, apremilast has been administered concomitantly with topical therapy (including \ncorticosteroids, coal tar shampoo and salicylic acid scalp preparations) and UVB phototherapy. \n \nThere was no clinically meaningful interaction between ketoconazole and apremilast. Apremilast can \nbe co-administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole.  \n \nThere was no pharmacokinetic interaction between apremilast and methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis \npatients. Apremilast can be co-administered with methotrexate. \n \nThere was no pharmacokinetic interaction between apremilast and oral contraceptives containing \nethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Apremilast can be co-administered with oral contraceptives. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy should be excluded before treatment can be initiated. Women of childbearing potential \nshould use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data about the use of apremilast in pregnant women. \n \nApremilast is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Effects of apremilast on pregnancy \nincluded embryofoetal loss in mice and monkeys, and reduced foetal weights and delayed ossification \nin mice at doses higher than the currently recommended highest human dose. No such effects were \nobserved when exposure in animals was at 1.3-fold the clinical exposure (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nApremilast was detected in milk of lactating mice (see section 5.3). It is not known whether \napremilast, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed infant cannot be \nexcluded, therefore apremilast should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data is available in humans. In animal studies in mice, no adverse effects on fertility were \nobserved in males at exposure levels 3-fold clinical exposure and in females at exposure levels 1-fold \nclinical exposure. For pre-clinical fertility data, see section 5.3. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nApremilast has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with apremilast in PsA and PSOR are gastrointestinal \n(GI) disorders including diarrhoea (15.7%) and nausea (13.9%). The other most commonly reported \nadverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections (8.4%), headache (7.9%), and tension \nheadache (7.2%) and are mostly mild to moderate in severity.   \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions with apremilast in BD are  diarrhoea (41.3%), \nnausea (19.2%), headache (14.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.5%), upper abdominal pain \n(8.7%), vomiting (8.7%) and back pain (7.7%) and are mostly mild to moderate in severity. \n \nThe gastrointestinal adverse reactions generally occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment and \nusually resolved within 4 weeks.  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions are uncommonly observed (see section 4.3). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with apremilast are listed below by system organ \nclass (SOC) and frequency for all adverse reactions. Within each SOC and frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions were determined based on data from the apremilast clinical development \nprogramme and post-marketing experience. The frequencies of adverse drug reactions are those \nreported in the apremilast arms of the four Phase III studies in PsA (n = 1,945) or the two Phase III \nstudies in PSOR (n = 1184), and in the phase III study in BD (n = 207) the highest frequency from \neither data pool is represented in table 2).  \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nTable 2.

Patients and caregivers should \nbe instructed to notify the prescriber of any suicidal ideation (see section 4.4). \n \nBody weight loss \nPatient weight was measured routinely in clinical studies. The mean observed weight loss in PsA and \nPSOR patients treated for up to 52 weeks with apremilast was 1.99 kg. A total of 14.3% of patients \nreceiving apremilast had observed weight loss between 5-10% while 5.7% of the patients receiving \napremilast had observed weight loss greater than 10%. None of these patients had overt clinical \nconsequences resulting from weight loss. A total of 0.1% of patients treated with apremilast \ndiscontinued due to adverse reaction of weight decreased. The mean observed weight loss in BD \npatients treated with apremilast for 52 weeks was 0.52 kg. A total of 11.8% of patients receving \napremilast had observed weight loss between 5-10% while 3.8% of the patients receiving apremilast \nhad observed weight loss greater than 10%.  None of these patients had overt clinical consequences \nfrom weight loss. None of the patients discontinued the study due to adverse reaction of weight \ndecreased. \n \nPlease see additional warning in section 4.4 for patients who are underweight at beginning of \ntreatment.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nFrom post-marketing experience, elderly patients \u2265 65 years of age may be at a higher risk of \ncomplications of severe diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe safety of apremilast was not evaluated in PsA, PSOR or BD patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nIn the PsA, PSOR or BD clinical studies, the safety profile observed in patients with mild renal \nimpairment was comparable to patients with normal renal function. The safety of apremilast was not \nevaluated in PsA, PSOR or BD patients with moderate or severe renal impairment in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nApremilast was studied in healthy subjects at a maximum total daily dose of 100 mg (given as 50 mg \ntwice daily) for 4.5 days without evidence of dose limiting toxicities. In case of an overdose, it is \nrecommended that the patient is monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and \nappropriate symptomatic treatment is instituted. In the event of overdose, symptomatic and supportive \ncare is advised. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosupressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA32 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nApremilast, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), works intracellularly to \nmodulate a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. PDE4 is a cyclic adenosine \nmonophosphate (cAMP)-specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition \nelevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory response by \nmodulating the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-23, IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines. Cyclic AMP \nalso modulates levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. These pro- and anti-inflammatory \nmediators have been implicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn clinical studies in patients with psoriatic arthritis, apremilast significantly modulated, but did not \nfully inhibit, plasma protein levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2, MMP-3, and TNF-\u03b1. After \n40 weeks of treatment with apremilast, there was a decrease in plasma protein levels of IL-17 and IL-\n23, and an increase in IL-10. In clinical studies in patients with psoriasis, apremilast decreased lesional \nskin epidermal thickness, inflammatory cell infiltration, and expression of pro-inflammatory genes, \nincluding those for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-17A, IL-22 and IL-8. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with Beh\u00e7et Disease treated with apremilast, there was a significant \npositive association between the change in plasma TNF-alpha and clinical efficacy as measured by the \nnumber of oral ulcers. \n \nApremilast administered at doses of up to 50 mg twice daily did not prolong the QT interval in healthy \nsubjects. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPsoriatic Arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of apremilast were evaluated in 3 multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies (Studies PALACE 1, PALACE 2, and PALACE 3) of similar design in \nadult patients with active PsA (\u2265 3 swollen joints and \u2265 3 tender joints) despite prior treatment with \nsmall molecule or biologic DMARDs. A total of 1,493 patients were randomised and treated with \neither placebo, apremilast 20 mg or apremilast 30 mg given orally twice daily. \n \nPatients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. One qualifying psoriatic skin \nlesion (at least 2 cm in diameter) was also required in PALACE 3. Apremilast was used as a \nmonotherapy (34.8%) or in combination with stable doses of small molecule DMARDs (65.2%). \nPatients received apremilast in combination with one or more of the following: methotrexate (MTX, \n\u2264 25 mg/week, 54.5%), sulfasalazine (SSZ, \u2264 2 g/day, 9.0%), and leflunomide (LEF; \u2264 20 mg/day, \n7.4%). Concomitant treatment with biologic DMARDs, including TNF blockers, was not allowed. \nPatients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled in the 3 studies, including symmetric polyarthritis \n(62.0%), asymmetric oligoarthritis (26.9%), distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint arthritis (6.2%), arthritis \nmutilans (2.7%), and predominant spondylitis (2.1%). Patients with pre-existing enthesopathy (63%) \nor pre-existing dactylitis (42%) were enrolled. A total of 76.4% of patients were previously treated \nwith only small-molecule DMARDs and 22.4% of patients were previously treated with biologic \nDMARDs, which includes 7.8% who had a therapeutic failure with a prior biologic DMARD. The \nmedian duration of PsA disease was 5 years.  \n \nBased on the study design, patients whose tender and swollen joint counts had not improved by at least \n20% were considered non-responders at week 16. Placebo patients who were considered non-\nresponders were re-randomised 1:1 in a blinded fashion to either apremilast 20 mg twice daily or \n30 mg twice daily. At week 24, all remaining placebo-treated patients were switched to either \napremilast 20 or 30 mg twice daily. Following 52 weeks of treatment, patients could continue on open \nlabel apremilast 20 mg or 30 mg within the long-term extension of the PALACE 1, PALACE 2, and \nPALACE 3 studies for a total duration of treatment up to 5 years (260 weeks). \n \nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology \n(ACR) 20 response at week 16. \n \nTreatment with apremilast resulted in significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA, as \nassessed by the ACR 20 response criteria compared to placebo at weeks 16. The proportion of patients \nwith ACR 20/50/70 (responses in studies PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3, and the pooled \ndata for studies PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3) for apremilast 30 mg twice daily at week 16 \nare shown in table 3. ACR 20/50/70 responses were maintained at week 24. \n \nAmong patients who were initially randomised to apremilast 30 mg twice daily treatment, ACR \n20/50/70 response rates were maintained through week 52 in the pooled studies PALACE 1, \nPALACE 2 and PALACE 3 (figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3.

The \nnumber of patients with arthritis mutilans and predominant spondylitis subtypes was too small to allow \nmeaningful assessment. \n \nIn PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3, improvements in Disease Activity Scale (DAS) 28 \nC-reactive protein (CRP) and in the proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA response criteria \n(PsARC) were greater in the apremilast group, compared to placebo at week 16 (nominal p-value \np < 0.0004, p-value \u2264 0.0017, respectively). These improvements were maintained at week 24. Among \npatients who remained on the apremilast treatment to which they were randomised at study start, \nDAS28 (CRP) score and PsARC response were maintained through week 52.  \n \nAt weeks 16 and 24 improvements in parameters of peripheral activity characteristic of psoriatic \narthritis (e.g. number of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and enthesitis) and \nin the skin manifestations of psoriasis were seen in the apremilast-treated patients. Among patients \nwho remained on the apremilast treatment to which they were randomised at study start, these \nimprovements were maintained through week 52.  \n \nThe clinical responses were maintained in the same parameters of peripheral activity and in the skin \nmanifestations of psoriasis in the open-label extension studies for up to 5 years of treatment. \n \nPhysical function and health-related quality of life  \n \nApremilast-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function, as \nassessed by the disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ-DI) change from \nbaseline, compared to placebo at weeks 16 in PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3 and in the \npooled studies. Improvement in HAQ-DI scores was maintained at week 24. \n \nAmong patients who were initially randomised to apremilast 30 mg twice daily treatment, the change \nfrom baseline in the HAQ-DI score at week 52 was -0.333 in the apremilast 30 mg twice daily group \nin a pooled analysis of the open label phase of studies PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3.  \n \nIn studies PALACE 1, PALACE 2 and PALACE 3, significant improvements were demonstrated in \nhealth-related quality of life, as measured by the changes from baseline in the physical functioning \n(PF) domain of the Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2), and in the Functional Assessment \nof Chronic Illness Therapy \u2013 Fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) scores in patients treated with apremilast \ncompared to placebo at weeks 16 and 24. Among patients who remained on the apremilast treatment, \nto which they were initially randomised at study start, improvement in physical function and FACIT-\nfatigue was maintained through week 52. \n \nImproved physical function as assessed by the HAQ-DI and the SF36v2PF domain, and the FACIT-\nfatigue scores were maintained in the open-label extension studies for up to 5 years of treatment. \n \nPsoriasis \nThe safety and efficacy of apremilast were evaluated in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies (Studies ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2) which enrolled a total of \n1,257 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had a body surface area (BSA) \ninvolvement of \u2265 10%, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \u2265 12, static Physician Global \nAssessment (sPGA) of \u2265 3 (moderate or severe), and who were candidates for phototherapy or \nsystemic therapy. \n \nThese studies had a similar design through week 32. In both studies, patients were randomised 2:1 to \napremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks (placebo-controlled phase) and from weeks 16-\n32, all patients received apremilast 30 mg twice daily (maintenance phase). During the Randomised \nTreatment Withdrawal Phase (weeks 32-52), patients originally randomised to apremilast who \n\n\n\n12 \n\nachieved at least a 75% reduction in their PASI score (PASI-75) (ESTEEM 1) or a 50% reduction in \ntheir PASI score (PASI-50) (ESTEEM 2) were re-randomised at week 32 to either placebo or \napremilast 30 mg twice daily. Patients who were re-randomised to placebo and who lost PASI-75 \nresponse (ESTEEM 1) or lost 50% of the PASI improvement at week 32 compared to baseline \n(ESTEEM 2) were retreated with apremilast 30 mg twice daily. Patients who did not achieve the \ndesignated PASI response by week 32, or who were initially randomised to placebo, remained on \napremilast until week 52. The use of low potency topical corticosteroids on the face, axillae, and groin, \ncoal tar shampoo and/or salicylic acid scalp preparations was permitted throughout the studies. In \naddition, at week 32, subjects who did not achieve a PASI-75 response in ESTEEM 1, or a PASI-50 \nresponse in ESTEEM 2, were permitted to use topical psoriasis therapies and/or phototherapy in \naddition to apremilast 30 mg twice daily treatment. \n \nFollowing 52 weeks of treatment, patients could continue on open-label apremilast 30 mg within the \nlong-term extension of the ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2 studies for a total duration of treatment up to 5 \nyears (260 weeks). \n \nIn both studies, the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved PASI-75 at \nweek 16. The major secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a sPGA score of \nclear (0) or almost clear (1) at week 16. \n \nThe mean baseline PASI score was 19.07 (median 16.80), and the proportion of patients with sPGA \nscore of 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe) at baseline was 70.0% and 29.8%, respectively with a mean \nbaseline BSA involvement of 25.19% (median 21.0%). Approximately 30% of all patients had \nreceived prior phototherapy and 54% had received prior conventional systemic and/or biologic therapy \nfor the treatment of psoriasis (including treatment failures), with 37% receiving prior conventional \nsystemic therapy and 30% receiving prior biologic therapy. Approximately one-third of patients had \nnot received prior phototherapy, conventional systemic or biologic therapy. A total of 18% of patients \nhad a history of psoriatic arthritis. \n \nThe proportion of patients achieving PASI-50, -75 and -90 responses, and sPGA score of clear (0) or \nalmost clear (1), are presented in table 4 below. Treatment with apremilast resulted in significant \nimprovement in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as demonstrated by the proportion of patients with \nPASI-75 response at week 16, compared to placebo. Clinical improvement measured by sPGA, PASI-\n50 and PASI-90 responses were also demonstrated at week 16. In addition, apremilast demonstrated a \ntreatment benefit across multiple manifestations of psoriasis including pruritus, nail disease, scalp \ninvolvement and quality of life measures. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nTable 4.

Subjects with missing data were counted as nonresponders.  \n \nIn study ESTEEM 1, approximately 61% of patients re-randomised to apremilast at week 32 had a \nPASI-75 response at week 52. Of the patients with at least a PASI-75 response who were re-\nrandomised to placebo at week 32 during a randomised treatment withdrawal phase, 11.7% were \nPASI-75 responders at week 52. The median time to loss of PASI-75 response among the patients re-\nrandomised to placebo was 5.1 weeks. \n \nIn study ESTEEM 2, approximately 80.3% of patients re-randomised to apremilast at week 32 had a \nPASI-50 response at week 52. Of the patients with at least a PASI-50 response who were re-\nrandomised to placebo at week 32, 24.2% were PASI-50 responders at week 52. The median time to \nloss of 50% of their week 32 PASI improvement was 12.4 weeks. \n \nAfter randomised withdrawal from therapy at week 32, approximately 70% of patients in study \nESTEEM 1, and 65.6% of patients in study ESTEEM 2, regained PASI-75 (ESTEEM 1) or PASI-50 \n(ESTEEM 2) responses after re-initiation of apremilast treatment. Due to the study design the duration \nof re-treatment was variable, and ranged from 2.6 to 22.1 weeks.  \n \nIn study ESTEEM 1, patients randomised to apremilast at the start of the study who did not achieve a \nPASI-75 response at week 32 were permitted to use concomitant topical therapies and/or UVB \nphototherapy between weeks 32 to 52. Of these patients, 12% achieved a PASI-75 response at \nweek 52 with apremilast plus topical and/or phototherapy treatment.  \n \nIn studies ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, significant improvements (reductions) in nail psoriasis, as \nmeasured by the mean percent change in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) from baseline, were \nobserved in patients receiving apremilast compared to placebo-treated patients at week 16 (p < 0.0001 \nand p = 0.0052, respectively). Further improvements in nail psoriasis were observed at week 32 in \npatients continuously treated with apremilast.  \n \nIn studies ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, significant improvements in scalp psoriasis of at least moderate \nseverity (\u2265 3), measured by the proportion of patients achieving Scalp Psoriasis Physician\u2019s Global \nAssessment (ScPGA) of clear (0) or minimal (1) at week 16, were observed in patients receiving \napremilast compared to placebo-treated patients (p < 0.0001 for both studies). The improvements were \ngenerally maintained in subjects who were re-randomised to apremilast at week 32 through week 52 \n(table 5). \n \nIn studies ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, significant improvements in quality of life as measured by the \nDermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the SF-36v2MCS were demonstrated in patients \nreceiving apremilast compared with placebo-treated patients (table 4). Improvements in DLQI were \nmaintained through week 52 in subjects who were re-randomised to apremilast at week 32 (table 5). In \naddition, in study ESTEEM 1, significant improvement in the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ-\n25) Index was achieved in patients receiving apremilast compared to placebo. \n \nAmong 832 patients initially randomised to apremilast 30 mg twice daily, 443 patients (53%) entered \nthe open-label extension studies of ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2, and of these 115 patients (26%) were \nstill on treatment at week 260. For patients who remained on apremilast in the open label extension of \n\n\n\n15 \n\nESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2 studies, improvements were generally maintained in PASI score, affected \nBSA, itch, nail and quality of life measures for up to 5 years. \n \nThe long-term safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily in patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis \nwas assessed for a total duration of treatment up to 5 years. Long-term experience in open-label \nextension studies with apremilast was generally comparable to the 52-week studies. \n \nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease \nThe safety and efficacy of apremilast were evaluated in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled study (RELIEF) in adult patients with active Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease (BD) with oral ulcers. \nPatients were previously treated with at least one non-biologic BD medication for oral ulcers and were \ncandidates for systemic therapy. Concomitant treatment for BD was not allowed. The population \nstudied met the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for BD with a history of skin lesions (98.6%), \ngenital ulcers (90.3%), musculoskeletal (72.5%), ocular (17.4%), central nervous system (9.7%) or GI \nmanifestations (9.2%), epididymitis (2.4%) and vascular involvement (1.4%). Patients with severe BD, \ndefined as those with active major organ involvement (for ex. meningoencephalitis or pulmonary \nartery aneurysm) were excluded. \n \nA total of 207 BD patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg twice daily \n(n = 104) or placebo (n = 103) for 12-weeks (placebo-controlled phase) and from weeks 12 to 64, all \npatients received apremilast 30 mg twice daily (active treatment phase). Patients ranged in age from 19 \nto 72 years, with a mean age of 40 years. The mean duration of BD was 6.84 years. All patients had a \nhistory of recurrent oral ulcers with at least 2 oral ulcers at screening and randomization: the mean \nbaseline oral ulcer counts were 4.2 and 3.9 in the apremilast and placebo groups, respectively. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the number of oral ulcers from \nbaseline through week 12. Secondary endpoints included other measures of oral ulcers: oral ulcer pain \nVisual Analog Scale (VAS), proportion of patients who are oral ulcer-free (complete response), time \nto onset of oral ulcer resolution, and proportion of patients achieving resolution of oral ulcers by week \n6, and who remain oral ulcer free at every visit for at least 6 additional weeks during the 12-week \nplacebo-controlled treatment phase. Other endpoints included Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Syndrome Activity Score \n(BSAS), BD Current Activity Form (BDCAF), including the BD Current Activity Index (BDCAI) \nscore, the Patient\u2019s Perception of Disease Activity, the Clinician\u2019s Overall Perception of Disease \nActivity and the BD Quality of Life Questionnaire (BD QoL). \n \nMeasure of oral ulcers \n \nApremilast 30 mg twice daily resulted in significant improvement in oral ulcers as demonstrated by \nthe AUC for the number of oral ulcers from baseline through week 12 (p < 0.0001), compared with \nplacebo.   \nSignificant improvements in other measures of oral ulcers were demonstrated at week 12. \n \nTable 6.

Apremilast \npharmacokinetics are linear, with a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure in the dose range \nof 10 to 100 mg daily. Accumulation is minimal when apremilast is administered once daily and \napproximately 53% in healthy subjects and 68% in patients with psoriasis when administered twice \ndaily. Co-administration with food does not alter the bioavailability therefore, apremilast can be \nadministered with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nDistribution \n \nHuman plasma protein binding of apremilast is approximately 68%. The mean apparent volume of \ndistribution (Vd) is 87 L, indicative of extravascular distribution. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nApremilast is extensively metabolised by both CYP and non-CYP mediated pathways including \noxidation, hydrolysis, and conjugation, suggesting inhibition of a single clearance pathway is not \nlikely to cause a marked drug-drug interaction. Oxidative metabolism of apremilast is primarily \nmediated by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2A6. Apremilast is the major \ncirculating component following oral administration. Apremilast undergoes extensive metabolism with \nonly 3% and 7% of the administered parent compound recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The \nmajor circulating inactive metabolite is the glucuronide conjugate of O-demethylated apremilast \n(M12). Consistent with apremilast being a substrate of CYP3A4, apremilast exposure is decreased \nwhen administered concomitantly with rifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4. \n \nIn vitro, apremilast is not an inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, apremilast co-\nadministered with substrates of CYP enzymes is unlikely to affect the clearance and exposure of active \nsubstances that are metabolised by CYP enzymes. \n \nIn vitro, apremilast is a substrate, and a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M), however \nclinically relevant drug interactions mediated via P-gp are not expected to occur. \n \nIn vitro, apremilast has little to no inhibitory effect (IC50 > 10 \u00b5M) on Organic Anion Transporter \n(OAT)1 and OAT3, Organic Cation Transporter (OCT)2, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide \n(OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and is not a substrate for these \ntransporters. Hence, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are unlikely when apremilast is co-\nadministered with drugs that are substrates or inhibitors of these transporters. \n \nElimination \n \nThe plasma clearance of apremilast is on average about 10 L/hr in healthy subjects, with a terminal \nelimination half-life of approximately 9 hours. Following oral administration of radiolabelled \napremilast, about 58% and 39% of the radioactivity is recovered in urine and faeces, respectively, with \nabout 3% and 7% of the radioactive dose recovered as apremilast in urine and faeces, respectively. \n \nElderly patients \n \nApremilast was studied in young and elderly healthy subjects. The exposure in elderly subjects (65 to \n85 years of age) is about 13% higher in AUC and about 6% higher in Cmax for apremilast than that in \nyoung subjects (18 to 55 years of age). There is limited pharmacokinetic data in subjects over 75 years \nof age in clinical trials. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThere is no meaningful difference in the PK of apremilast between mild or moderate renally impaired \nsubjects and matched healthy subjects (N = 8 each). The results support that no dose adjustment is \nneeded in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. Apremilast dose should be reduced to \n30 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or \nCLcr < 30 mL/min). In 8 subjects with severe renal impairment to whom a single dose of 30 mg \napremilast was administered, the AUC and Cmax of apremilast increased by approximately 89% and \n42%, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of apremilast and its major metabolite M12 are not affected by moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. There is no evidence of immunotoxic, dermal irritation, or \nphototoxic potential. \n \nFertility and early embryonic development \n \nIn a male mouse fertility study, apremilast at oral dosages of 1, 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day produced no \neffects on male fertility; the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for male fertility was \ngreater than 50 mg/kg/day 3-fold clinical exposure.  \n \nIn a combined female mouse fertility and embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study with oral \ndosages of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day, a prolongation of oestrous cycles and increased time to \nmating were observed at 20 mg/kg/day and above; despite this, all mice mated and pregnancy rates \nwere unaffected. The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) for female fertility was 10 mg/kg/day (1.0-\nfold clinical exposure). \n \nEmbryo-foetal development \n \nIn a combined female mouse fertility and embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study with oral \ndosages of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day, absolute and/or relative heart weights of maternal animals \nwere increased at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day. Increased numbers of early resorptions and reduced \nnumbers of ossified tarsals were observed at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day. Reduced foetal weights and \nretarded ossification of the supraoccipital bone of the skull were observed at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day. \nThe maternal and developmental NOEL in the mouse was 10 mg/kg/day (1.3-fold clinical exposure).  \n \nIn a monkey embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study, oral dosages of 20, 50, 200, and \n1000 mg/kg/day resulted in a dose-related increase in prenatal loss (abortions) at dosages of \n50 mg/kg/day and above; no test article-related effect in prenatal loss was observed at 20 mg/kg/day \n(1.4-fold clinical exposure).  \n \nPre- and post-natal development \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal study, apremilast was administered orally to pregnant female mice at dosages \nof 10, 80 and 300 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day (GD) 6 to day 20 of lactation. Reductions in \nmaternal body weight and weight gain, and one death associated with difficulty in delivering pups \nwere observed at 300 mg/kg/day. Physical signs of maternal toxicity associated with delivering pups \nwere also observed in one mouse at each of 80 and 300 mg/kg/day. Increased peri- and postnatal pup \ndeaths and reduced pup body weights during the first week of lactation were observed at \n\u2265 80 mg/kg/day (\u2265 4.0-fold clinical exposure). There were no apremilast-related effects on duration of \npregnancy, number of pregnant mice at the end of the gestation period, number of mice that delivered \na litter, or any developmental effects in the pups beyond postnatal day 7. It is likely that pup \ndevelopmental effects observed during the first week of the postnatal period were related to the \napremilast-related pup toxicity (decreased pup weight and viability) and/or lack of maternal care \n(higher incidence of no milk in the stomach of pups). All developmental effects were observed during \nthe first week of the postnatal period; no apremilast-related effects were seen during the remaining \npre- and post-weaning periods, including sexual maturation, behavioural, mating, fertility and uterine \nparameters. The NOEL in the mouse for maternal toxicity and F1 generation was 10 mg/kg/day (1.3-\nfold clinical AUC). \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nCarcinogenicity studies \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenicity related to treatment \nwith apremilast.  \n \nGenotoxicity studies \n \nApremilast is not genotoxic. Apremilast did not induce mutations in an Ames assay or chromosome \naberrations in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the presence or absence of metabolic \nactivation. Apremilast was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at doses up to \n2,000 mg/kg/day. \n \nOther studies \n \nThere is no evidence of immunotoxic, dermal irritation, or phototoxic potential.  \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Otezla \n3. How to take Otezla \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Otezla \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Otezla is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Otezla is \n \nOtezla contains the active substance \u2018apremilast\u2019. This belongs to a group of medicines called \nphosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation. \n \nWhat Otezla is used for \n \nOtezla is used to treat adults with the following conditions: \n\uf0b7 Active psoriatic arthritis - if you cannot use another type of medicine called \n\n\u2018Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs\u2019 (DMARDs) or when you have tried one of these \nmedicines and it did not work.  \n\n\uf0b7 Moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis - if you cannot use one of the following \ntreatments or when you have tried one of these treatments and it did not work: \n- phototherapy - a treatment where certain areas of skin are exposed to ultraviolet light \n- systemic therapy - a treatment that affects the entire body rather than just one local area, \n\nsuch as \u2018ciclosporin\u2019, \u2018methotrexate\u2019 or \u2018psoralen \u2019. \n\uf0b7 Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (BD) - to treat the mouth ulcers which is a common problem for people with \n\nthis illness. \n \nWhat psoriatic arthritis is \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an \ninflammatory disease of the skin.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWhat plaque psoriasis is \n \nPsoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin, which can cause red, scaly, thick, itchy, painful \npatches on your skin and can also affect your scalp and nails.  \n \nWhat Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is \n \nBeh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is a rare type of inflammatory disease which affects many parts of the body. The \nmost common problem is mouth ulcers. \n \nHow Otezla works \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease are usually lifelong conditions and there is currently \nno cure. Otezla works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called \u2018phosphodiesterase 4\u2019, \nwhich is involved in the process of inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Otezla can \nhelp to control the inflammation associated with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, and \nthereby reduce the signs and symptoms of these conditions. \n \nIn psoriatic arthritis, treatment with Otezla results in an improvement in swollen and painful joints, \nand can improve your general physical function. \n \nIn psoriasis, treatment with Otezla results in a reduction in psoriatic skin plaques and other signs and \nsymptoms of the disease. \n \nIn Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, treatment with Otezla reduces the number of mouth ulcers and can stop them \ncompletely. It can also reduce the associated pain. \n \nOtezla has also been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis \nor Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. This means that the impact of your condition on daily activities, relationships and \nother factors should be less than it was before.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Otezla \n \nDo not take Otezla: \n \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to apremilast or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n\uf0b7 if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Otezla. \n \nDepression and suicidal thoughts \n \nTell your doctor before starting Otezla if you have depression which is getting worse with thoughts of \nsuicide.  \n \nYou or your caregiver should also tell your doctor straight away of any changes in behaviour or mood, \nfeelings of depression and of any suicidal thoughts you may have after taking Otezla. \n \nSevere kidney problems \n \nIf you have severe kidney problems, your dose will be different \u2013 see section 3. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nIf you are underweight \n \nTalk to your doctor while taking Otezla if you lose weight without meaning to. \n \nGut problems \n \nIf you experience severe diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting, you should talk to your doctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nOtezla has not been studied in children and adolescents, therefore it is not recommended for use in \nchildren and adolescents aged 17 years and under.  \n \nOther medicines and Otezla \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Otezla \ncan affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Otezla \nworks.  \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Otezla if you are taking any of the following \nmedicines: \n \n\uf0b7 rifampicin \u2013 an antibiotic used for tuberculosis  \n\uf0b7 phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine - medicines used in the treatment of seizures or \n\nepilepsy \n\uf0b7 St John\u2019s Wort \u2013 a herbal medicine for mild anxiety and depression. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nThere is little information about the effects of Otezla in pregnancy. You should not become pregnant \nwhile taking this medicine and should use an effective method of contraception during treatment with \nOtezla.  \nIt is not known if this medicine passes into human milk. You should not use Otezla while breast-\nfeeding.  \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nOtezla has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nOtezla contains lactose  \n \nOtezla contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Otezla  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nHow much to take \n \n\uf0b7 When you first start taking Otezla, you will receive a \u2018treatment initiation pack\u2019 which contains \n\nall the doses as listed in the table below. \n\uf0b7 The \u2018treatment initiation pack\u2019 is clearly labelled to make sure you take the correct tablet at the \n\ncorrect time. \n\uf0b7 Your treatment will start at a lower dose and will gradually be increased over the first 6 days of \n\ntreatment. \n\uf0b7 The \u2018treatment initiation pack\u2019 will also contain enough tablets for another 8 days at the \n\nrecommended dose (days 7 to 14). \n\uf0b7 The recommended dose of Otezla is 30 mg twice a day after the titration phase is complete - one \n\n30 mg dose in the morning and one 30 mg dose in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart, \nwith or without food. \n\n\uf0b7 This is a total daily dose of 60 mg. By the end of day 6 you will have reached this recommended \ndose.  \n\n\uf0b7 Once the recommended dose has been reached, you will only get the 30 mg tablet strength in \nyour prescribed packs. You will only ever need to go through this stage of gradually increasing \nyour dose once even if you re-start treatment.  \n\n \n\n \nPeople with severe kidney problems \n \nIf you have severe kidney problems then the recommended dose of Otezla is 30 mg once a day \n(morning dose). Your doctor will talk to you about how to increase your dose when you first start \ntaking Otezla. \n \nHow and when to take Otezla  \n \n\uf0b7 Otezla is for oral use. \n\uf0b7 Swallow the tablets whole, preferably with water. \n\uf0b7 You can take the tablets either with or without food. \n\uf0b7 Take Otezla at about the same time each day, one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the \n\nevening. \n \nIf your condition has not improved after six months of treatment, you should talk to your doctor.  \n \nIf you take more Otezla than you should \n \nIf you take more Otezla than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the \nmedicine pack and this leaflet with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Otezla \n \n\uf0b7 If you miss a dose of Otezla, take it as soon as you remember. If it is close to the time for your \n\nnext dose, just skip the missed dose. Take the next dose at your regular time.  \n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nDay Morning Dose Evening Dose Total Daily Dose \nDay 1 10 mg (pink) Do not take a dose 10 mg \nDay 2 10 mg (pink) 10 mg (pink) 20 mg \nDay 3 10 mg (pink) 20 mg (brown) 30 mg \nDay 4 20 mg (brown) 20 mg (brown) 40 mg \nDay 5 20 mg (brown) 30 mg (beige) 50 mg \nDay 6 onwards 30 mg (beige) 30 mg (beige) 60 mg \n\n\n\n38 \n\nIf you stop taking Otezla \n \n\uf0b7 You should continue taking Otezla until your doctor tells you to stop.  \n\uf0b7 Do not stop taking Otezla without talking to your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what otezla is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what otezla is otezla contains the active substance 'apremilast'. this belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation. what otezla is used for otezla is used to treat adults with the following conditions: active psoriatic arthritis - if you cannot use another type of medicine called 'disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs' (dmards) or when you have tried one of these medicines and it did not work. moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis - if you cannot use one of the following treatments or when you have tried one of these treatments and it did not work: - phototherapy - a treatment where certain areas of skin are exposed to ultraviolet light - systemic therapy - a treatment that affects the entire body rather than just one local area, such as 'ciclosporin', 'methotrexate' or 'psoralen '. beh\u00e7et's disease (bd) - to treat the mouth ulcers which is a common problem for people with this illness. what psoriatic arthritis is psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin. what plaque psoriasis is psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin, which can cause red, scaly, thick, itchy, painful patches on your skin and can also affect your scalp and nails. what beh\u00e7et's disease is beh\u00e7et's disease is a rare type of inflammatory disease which affects many parts of the body. the most common problem is mouth ulcers. how otezla works psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and beh\u00e7et's disease are usually lifelong conditions and there is currently no cure. otezla works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called 'phosphodiesterase 4', which is involved in the process of inflammation. by reducing the activity of this enzyme, otezla can help to control the inflammation associated with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and beh\u00e7et's disease, and thereby reduce the signs and symptoms of these conditions. in psoriatic arthritis, treatment with otezla results in an improvement in swollen and painful joints, and can improve your general physical function. in psoriasis, treatment with otezla results in a reduction in psoriatic skin plaques and other signs and symptoms of the disease. in beh\u00e7et's disease, treatment with otezla reduces the number of mouth ulcers and can stop them completely. it can also reduce the associated pain. otezla has also been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or beh\u00e7et's disease. this means that the impact of your condition on daily activities, relationships and other factors should be less than it was before.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "otezla", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 10, "BeginOffset": 5, "EndOffset": 11, "Score": 0.9575501084327698, "Text":
