NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAloxi 250 micrograms solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 50 micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride). \nEach vial of 5 ml of solution contains 250 micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAloxi is indicated in adults for: \n• the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer \n\nchemotherapy,  \n• the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer \n\nchemotherapy. \n \n\nAloxi is indicated in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for: \n• the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer \n\nchemotherapy and prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic \ncancer chemotherapy. \n \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAloxi should be used only before chemotherapy administration. This medicinal product should be \nadministered by a healthcare professional under appropriate medical supervision. \n \nPosology \nAdults \n \n250 micrograms palonosetron administered as a single intravenous bolus approximately 30 minutes \nbefore the start of chemotherapy. Aloxi should be injected over 30 seconds. \n \nThe efficacy of Aloxi in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a corticosteroid administered prior to \nchemotherapy. \n \nElderly people \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and Adolescents (aged 1 month to 17 years): \n20 micrograms/kg (the maximum total dose should not exceed 1500 micrograms) palonosetron \nadministered as a single 15 minute intravenous infusion beginning approximately 30 minutes before \nthe start of chemotherapy. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Aloxi in children aged less than 1 month have not been established. No \ndata are available. There are limited data on the use of Aloxi in the prevention of nausea and vomiting \nin children under 2 years of age. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired hepatic function. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired renal function. \nNo data are available for patients with end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis.  \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravenous use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs palonosetron may increase large bowel transit time, patients with a history of constipation or signs \nof subacute intestinal obstruction should be monitored following administration. Two cases of \nconstipation with faecal impaction requiring hospitalisation have been reported in association with \npalonosetron 750 micrograms. \n \nAt all dose levels tested, palonosetron did not induce clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc \ninterval. A specific thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in healthy volunteers for definitive data \ndemonstrating the effect of palonosetron on QT/QTc (see section 5.1). \n \nHowever, as for other 5-HT3 antagonists, caution should be exercised in the use of palonosetron in \npatients who have or are likely to develop prolongation of the QT interval. These conditions include \npatients with a personal or family history of QT prolongation, electrolyte abnormalities, congestive \nheart failure, bradyarrhythmias, conduction disturbances and in patients taking anti-arrhythmic agents \nor other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalemia \nand hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to 5-HT3-antagonist administration. \n \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome with the use of 5-HT3 antagonists either alone or in \ncombination with other serotonergic drugs (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) \nand serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Appropriate observation of patients for \nserotonin syndrome-like symptoms is advised. \n \nAloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy \nif not associated with another chemotherapy administration. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- \nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPalonosetron is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor contribution by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 \nisoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 \nisoenzyme at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nChemotherapeutic agents \nIn preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumour activity of the five chemotherapeutic \nagents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C). \n \nMetoclopramide \nIn a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction was shown between a single \nintravenous dose of palonosetron and steady state concentration of oral metoclopramide, which is a \nCYP2D6 inhibitor.   \n \nCYP2D6 inducers and inhibitors \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, it has been shown that there was no significant effect on \npalonosetron clearance when co-administered with CYP2D6 inducers (dexamethasone and \nrifampicin) and inhibitors (including amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, \nfluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, quinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline or terbinafine). \n \nCorticosteroids \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with corticosteroids. \n \nSerotonergic Drugs (e.g. SSRIs and SNRIs) \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome following concomitant use of 5-HT3 \nantagonists and other serotonergic drugs (including SSRIs and SNRIs). \n \nOther medicinal products \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with analgesics, antiemetic/antinauseants, antispasmodics \nand anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFor Palonosetron no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development. Only limited data from animal studies are available regarding \nthe placental transfer (see section 5.3). \nThere is no experience of palonosetron in human pregnancy. Therefore, palonosetron should not be \nused in pregnant women unless it is considered essential by the physician.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nAs there are no data concerning palonosetron excretion in breast milk, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued during therapy. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning the effect of palonosetron on fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \nSince palonosetron may induce dizziness, somnolence or fatigue, patients should be cautioned when \ndriving or operating machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical studies in adults at a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients) the most frequently \nobserved adverse reactions, at least possibly related to Aloxi, were headache (9 %) and constipation \n(5 %).  \n \nIn the clinical studies the following adverse reactions (ARs) were observed as possibly or probably \nrelated to Aloxi.  These were classified as common (≥1/100 to <1/10) or uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100). Very rare (<1/10,000) adverse reactions were reported post-marketing. \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented below in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n° From post-marketing experience \n\nSystem organ class Common ARs \n(≥1/100 to<1/10) \n\nUncommon ARs \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nVery rare ARs° \n(<1/10,000) \n\nImmune system disorders   Hypersensitivity, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactic/ \nanaphylactoid reactions \nand shock \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyperkalaemia, metabolic \ndisorders, hypocalcaemia, \nhypokalaemia, anorexia, \nhyperglycaemia, appetite \n\ndecreased \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Anxiety, euphoric mood  \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \nDizziness \n\nSomnolence, insomnia, \nparaesthesia, hypersomnia, \n\nperipheral sensory \nneuropathy \n\n \n\nEye disorders  Eye irritation, amblyopia  \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders  Motion sickness, tinnitus  \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia, bradycardia, \nextrasystoles, myocardial \n\nischaemia, sinus \ntachycardia, sinus \n\narrhythmia, \nsupraventricular \n\nextrasystoles \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension, hypertension, \nvein discolouration, vein \n\ndistended \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Hiccups  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation \nDiarrhoea \n\nDyspepsia, abdominal pain, \nabdominal pain upper, dry \n\nmouth, flatulence \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  Hyperbilirubinaemia  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Dermatitis allergic, pruritic \nrash \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Arthralgia  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  Urinary retention, \nglycosuria \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Asthenia, pyrexia, fatigue, \nfeeling hot, influenza like \n\nillness \n\nInjection site reaction* \n\nInvestigations  Elevated transaminases-, \nelectrocardiogram QT \n\nprolonged \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n* Includes the following: burning, induration, discomfort and pain \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately or highly \nemetogenic chemotherapy, 402 patients received a single dose of palonosetron (3, 10 or 20 mcg/kg). \nThe following common or uncommon adverse reactions were reported for palonosetron, none were \nreported at a frequency of >1%. \n \nSystem organ class Common ARs \n\n(≥1/100 to<1/10) \nUncommon ARs \n\n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness, dyskinesia \n\nCardiac disorders  Electrocardiogram QT \nprolonged \n\nconduction disorder, sinus \ntachycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Dermatitis allergic,  pruritus, \nskin disorder, urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Pyrexia, infusion site pain, \ninfusion site reaction, pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were evaluated in paediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 \nchemotherapy cycles. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \nDoses of up to 6 mg have been used in adult clinical studies. The highest dose group showed a similar \nincidence of adverse reactions compared to the other dose groups and no dose response effects were \nobserved. In the unlikely event of overdose with Aloxi, this should be managed with supportive care. \nDialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is \nunlikely to be an effective treatment for Aloxi overdose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported in paediatric clinical studies. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, serotonin (5HT3) antagonists. ATC code: \nA04AA05 \n \nPalonosetron is a selective high-affinity receptor antagonist of the 5HT3 receptor. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nIn two randomised, double-blind studies with a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately \nemetogenic chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≤50 mg/m2, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide \n≤1,500 mg/m2 and doxorubicin >25 mg/m2, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were \ncompared with ondansetron 32 mg (half-life 4 hours) or dolasetron 100 mg (half-life 7.3 hours) \nadministered intravenously on Day 1, without dexamethasone.  \nIn a randomised, double-blind study with a total of 667 patients receiving highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide > 1,500 mg/m2 and dacarbazine, \npalonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg \nadministered intravenously on Day 1. Dexamethasone was administered prophylactically before \nchemotherapy in 67 % of patients. \n \nThe pivotal studies were not designed to assess efficacy of palonosetron in delayed onset nausea and \nvomiting. The antiemetic activity was observed during 0-24 hours, 24-120 hours and 0-120 hours. \nResults for the studies on moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and for the study on highly \nemetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables. \n \nPalonosetron was non-inferior versus the comparators in the acute phase of emesis both in moderately \nand highly emetogenic setting.  \n \nAlthough comparative efficacy of palonosetron in multiple cycles has not been demonstrated in \ncontrolled clinical studies, 875 patients enrolled in the three phase 3 trials continued in an open label \nsafety study and were treated with palonosetron 750 micrograms for up to 9 additional cycles of \nchemotherapy. The overall safety was maintained during all cycles. \n \n \nTable 1:   Percentage of patients a responding by treatment group and phase in the Moderately \n\nEmetogenic Chemotherapy study versus ondansetron  \n \n\n Aloxi \n250 micrograms \n\n(n= 189) \n\nOndansetron \n32 milligrams \n\n(n= 185) Delta \n\n \n \n\n % % %  \n\n Complete Response (No Emesis and No Rescue Medication) 97.5 % CI b \n\n0 – 24 hours 81.0 68.6 12.4 [1.8 %, 22.8 %] \n24 – 120 hours 74.1 55.1 19.0 [7.5 %, 30.3 %] \n0 – 120 hours 69.3 50.3 19.0 [7.4 %, 30.7 %] \n\n Complete Control (Complete Response and No More Than Mild Nausea) p-value c \n0 – 24 hours 76.2 65.4 10.8          NS \n\n24 – 120 hours 66.7 50.3 16.4 0.001 \n0 – 120 hours 63.0 44.9 18.1 0.001 \n\n No Nausea (Likert Scale) p-value c \n\n0 – 24 hours 60.3 56.8 3.5            NS \n24 – 120 hours 51.9 39.5 12.4       NS \n0 – 120 hours 45.0 36.2 8.8       NS \n\na   Intent-to-treat cohort. \nb   The study was designed to show non-inferiority.

Significance level at α=0.05. \n \nThe effect of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were \ncomparable to ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical studies. In non-clinical studies \npalonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation \nand to prolong action potential duration. \nThe effect of palonosetron on QTc interval was evaluated in a double blind, randomised, parallel, \nplacebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled trial in adult men and women. The objective was to \nevaluate the ECG effects of IV administered palonosetron at single doses of 0.25, 0.75 or 2.25 mg in \n221 healthy subjects. The study demonstrated no effect on QT/QTc interval duration as well as any \nother ECG interval at doses up to 2.25 mg. No clinically significant changes were shown on heart \nrate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction and cardiac repolarisation. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nPrevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV):  \nThe safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of 3 µg/kg and 10 µg/kg was investigated \nin the first clinical study in 72 patients in the following age groups, >28 days to 23 months (12 \npatients), 2 to 11 years (31 patients), and 12 to 17 years of age (29 patients), receiving highly or \nmoderately emetogenic chemotherapy.  No safety concerns were raised at either dose level. The \nprimary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR, defined as no \nemetic episode and no rescue medication) during the first 24 hours after the start of chemotherapy \nadministration. Efficacy after palonosetron 10 µg/kg compared to palonosetron 3µg/kg was 54.1% \nand 37.1% respectively.  \n \nThe efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric \ncancer patients was demonstrated in a second non-inferiority pivotal trial comparing a single \nintravenous infusion of palonosetron versus an i.v. ondansetron regimen. A total of 493 paediatric \npatients, aged 64 days to 16.9 years, receiving moderately (69.2%) or highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy (30.8%) were treated with palonosetron 10 µg/kg (maximum 0.75 mg), palonosetron \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n20 µg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) or ondansetron (3 x 0.15 mg/kg , maximum total dose 32 mg) 30 \nminutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy during Cycle 1. Most patients were non-naïve \nto chemotherapy (78.5%) across all treatment groups. Emetogenic chemotherapies administered \nincluded doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m2), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, \ncarboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered \nwith chemotherapy in 55% of patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was Complete Response in the \nacute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy, defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue \nmedication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating \nnon-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority \ncriteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete \nResponse rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. In \nthe palonosetron 10 µg/kg, 20 µg/kg and ondansetron groups, the proportion of patients with CR0-24h \nwas 54.2%, 59.4% and 58.6%. Since the 97.5% confidence interval (stratum adjusted Mantel-\nHaenszel test) of the difference in CR0-24h between palonosetron 20 µg/kg and ondansetron was [-\n11.7%, 12.4%], the 20 µg/kg palonosetron dose demonstrated non-inferiority to ondansetron.  \n \nWhile this study demonstrated that paediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults \nto prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the \nestablished profile in adults (see section 4.8). Pharmacokinetic information is provided in section 5.2. \n \nPrevention of Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV): \nTwo paediatric trials were performed. The safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of \n1µg/kg and 3µg/kg was compared in the first clinical study in 150 patients in the following age \ngroups, >28 days to 23 months (7 patients), 2 to 11 years (96 patients), and 12 to 16 years of age (47 \npatients) undergoing elective surgery. No safety concerns were raised in either treatment group. The \nproportion of patients without emesis during 0-72 hours post-operatively was similar after \npalonosetron 1 µg/kg or 3 µg/kg (88% vs 84%). \nThe second paediatric,trial was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel \ngroup, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, comparing i.v. palonosetron (1 µg/kg, max \n0.075 mg) versus I.V. ondansetron. A total of 670 paediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 \ndays to 16.9 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, \nand no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% \nof patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified \nnon-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority \nconfidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, \n1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. No new safety concerns were raised in either \ntreatment group. \n \nPlease see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nFollowing intravenous administration, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by slow \nelimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours. \nMean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) \nare generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3–90 μg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer \npatients. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 \ntesticular cancer patients, the mean (± SD) increase in plasma concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was \n42 ± 34 %. After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 \nhealthy subjects, the mean (± SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 \nwas 110 ± 45 %. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nPharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall exposure (AUC0-∞) of 0.25 mg intravenous \npalonosetron administered once daily for 3 consecutive days was similar to a single intravenous dose \nof 0.75 mg, although Cmax of the 0.75 mg single dose was higher.   \n \nDistribution \nPalonosetron at the recommended dose is widely distributed in the body with a volume of distribution \nof approximately 6.9 to 7.9 l/kg. Approximately 62 % of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \nPalonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40 % eliminated through the kidney and with \napproximately 50 % metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1 % of the \n5HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that \nCYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of \npalonosetron.  However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between \npoor and extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. Palonosetron does not inhibit or induce \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nElimination \nAfter a single intravenous dose of 10 micrograms/kg [14C]-palonosetron, approximately 80 % of the \ndose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40 % \nof the administered dose, as unchanged active substance. After a single intravenous bolus \nadministration in healthy subjects the total body clearance of palonosetron was 173 ± 73 ml/min and \nrenal clearance was 53 ± 29 ml/min.  The low total body clearance and large volume of distribution \nresulted in a terminal elimination half-life in plasma of approximately 40 hours. Ten percent of \npatients have a mean terminal elimination half-life greater than 100 hours. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nElderly people  \nAge does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly patients. \n \nGender \nGender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dosage adjustment is necessary \nbased on gender. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSingle-dose i.v. Aloxi pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of paediatric cancer patients \n(n=280) that received 10 µg/kg or 20 µg/kg. When the dose was increased from10 µg/kg to 20 µg/kg \na dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Following single dose intravenous infusion \nof Aloxi 20 µg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were \nhighly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years than in older paediatric \npatients. Median half-life was 29.5 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours \nacross age groups after administration of 20 µg/kg. \n \nThe total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. \nThere are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nTable 4: Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Paediatric Cancer Patients following intravenous \ninfusion of Aloxi at 20 µg/kg over 15 min and in Adult Cancer Patients receiving 3 and 10 µg/kg \npalonosetron doses via intravenous bolus. \n\n Paediatric Cancer Patientsa \nAdults Cancer \n\nPatientsb \n\n <2 y 2 to <6 y 6 to <12 \ny \n\n12 to <17 \ny \n\n3.0 \nµg/kg \n\n10 µg/kg \n\n N=3 N=5 N=7 N=10 N=6 N=5 \n\nAUC0-∞, h·µg/L 69.0 \n(49.5) \n\n103.5 \n(40.4) \n\n98.7 \n(47.7) \n\n124.5 \n(19.1) \n\n35.8 \n(20.9) \n\n81.8 \n(23.9) \n\nt½, hours 24.0 28 23.3 30.5 \n56.4 \n\n(5.81) \n49.8 \n\n(14.4) \n\n N=6 N=14 N=13 N=19 N=6 N=5 \n\nClearance c, L/h/kg 0.31 \n(34.7) \n\n0.23 \n(51.3) \n\n0.19 \n(46.8) \n\n0.16 \n(27.8) \n\n0.10 \n(0.04) \n\n0.13 \n(0.05) \n\nVolume of distribution c, d, L/kg 6.08 \n(36.5) \n\n5.29 \n(57.8) \n\n6.26 \n(40.0) \n\n6.20 \n(29.0) \n\n7.91 \n(2.53) \n\n9.56 \n(4.21) \n\na PK parameters expressed as Geometric Mean (CV) except for T½ which is median. \nb PK parameters expressed as Arithmetic mean (SD) \nc Clearance and Volume of distribution in paediatric patients were calculated weight-adjusted from both 10 µg \n/kg and 20 µg /kg dose groups combined. In adults, different dose levels are indicated in column title. \nd Vss is reported for paediatric cancer patients, whereas Vz is reported for adult cancer patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nMild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron  pharmacokinetic \nparameters.  Severe renal impairment reduces renal clearance, however total body clearance in these \npatients is similar to healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. No pharmacokinetic data in haemodialysis patients are available. \n \n \nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the \nhealthy subjects. While the terminal elimination half-life and mean systemic exposure of palonosetron \nis increased in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment, this does not warrant dose reduction. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of \nthe maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nNon-clinical studies indicate that palonosetron, only at very high concentrations, may block ion \nchannels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and prolong action potential duration. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Only limited data from animal \nstudies are available regarding the placental transfer (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nPalonosetron is not mutagenic. High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 30 times the \nhuman therapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, \nendocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not \nin mice. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because of the high doses \nemployed and since Aloxi is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not \nconsidered relevant for clinical use. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAloxi 500 micrograms soft capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 500 micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient(s): \nEach capsule contains 7 mg sorbitol.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSoft capsule. \n \nPlain, light beige, opaque, round to oval, soft gelatine capsules, filled with a clear yellowish solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAloxi is indicated in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately \nemetogenic cancer chemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAloxi should be used only before chemotherapy administration. \n \nPosology \n \nUAdults \n \n500 micrograms palonosetron administered orally approximately one hour before the start of \nchemotherapy.  \n \nUElderly population \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly.  \n \nUPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Aloxi in children have not been established.  Currently available data are \ndescribed in section 5.1 and section 5.2, but no recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nUHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired hepatic function. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nURenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired renal function. \nNo data are available for patients with end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \nAloxi can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs palonosetron may increase large bowel transit time, patients with a history of constipation or signs \nof subacute intestinal obstruction should be monitored following administration. Two cases of \nconstipation with faecal impaction requiring hospitalisation have been reported in association with \npalonosetron 750 micrograms. \n \nAt all dose levels tested, palonosetron did not induce clinically relevant prolongation of the QT \ncorrected (QTc) interval. A specific thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in healthy volunteers for \ndefinitive data demonstrating the effect of palonosetron on QT/QTc. (see section 5.1). \n \nHowever, as for other 5-HT3 antagonists, caution should be exercised in the use of palonosetron in \npatients who have or are likely to develop prolongation of the QT interval. These conditions include \npatients with a personal or family history of QT prolongation, electrolyte abnormalities, congestive \nheart failure, bradyarrhythmias, conduction disturbances and in patients taking anti-arrhythmic agents \nor other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalemia \nand hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to 5-HT3-antagonist administration. \n \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome with the use of 5-HT3 antagonists either alone or in \ncombination with other serotonergic drugs (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) \nand serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Appropriate observation of patients for \nserotonin syndrome-like symptoms is advised. \n  \nAloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy \nif not associated with another chemotherapy administration. \n \nAloxi contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take \nthis medicinal product. Aloxi capsules may also contain a trace of lecithin derived from soya. \nTherefore, patients with known hypersensitivity to peanut or soya, should be monitored closely for \nsigns of an allergic reaction. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPalonosetron is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor contribution by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 \nisoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 \nisoenzyme at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nUChemotherapeutic medicinal productsU  \nIn preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumour activity of the five chemotherapeutic \nagents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n \nUMetoclopramideU \nIn a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction was shown between a single \nintravenous dose of palonosetron and steady state concentration of oral metoclopramide, which is a \nCYP2D6 inhibitor.   \n \nUCYP2D6 inducers and inhibitorsU \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, it has been shown that there was no significant effect on \npalonosetron clearance when co-administered with CYP2D6 inducers (dexamethasone and \nrifampicin) and inhibitors (including amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, \nfluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, quinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline or terbinafine). \n \nUCorticosteroidsU \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with corticosteroids. \n \nSerotonergic Drugs (e.g. SSRIs and SNRIs) \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome following concomitant use of 5-HT3 \nantagonists and other serotonergic drugs (including SSRIs and SNRIs). \n \nUOther medicinal productsU \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with analgesics, antiemetic/antinauseants, antispasmodics \nand anticholinergic medicinal products.  \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nFor Palonosetron, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development. Only limited data from animal studies are available regarding \nthe placental transfer (see section 5.3). There is no experience of palonosetron in human pregnancy so \npalonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered essential by the physician. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAs there are no data concerning palonosetron excretion in breast milk, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued during therapy. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning the effect of palonosetron on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \nSince palonosetron may induce dizziness, somnolence or fatigue, patients should be cautioned when \ndriving or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn clinical studies at a dose of 500 micrograms (total 161 patients) the most frequently observed \nadverse reaction, at least possibly related to Aloxi, was headache (3.7 %).  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nIn the clinical studies the following adverse reactions (ARs) were observed as possibly or probably \nrelated to Aloxi. These were classified as common (≥1/100 to <1/10) or uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100).   \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Common ARs \n \n\nUncommon ARs \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Insomnia \nNervous system disorders Headache  \nEye disorders  Eye swelling \nCardiac disorders  Atrioventricular block first degree, \n\natrioventricular block second degree \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Constipation, nausea \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Myalgia \n\nInvestigations  Blood bilirubin increased \nIn post marketing very rare cases (<1/10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions occurred with palonosetron \nsolution for injection for intravenous use. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported.   \n \nDoses of up to 6 mg have been used in clinical trials. The highest dose group showed a similar \nincidence of adverse reactions compared to the other dose groups and no dose response effects were \nobserved. In the unlikely event of overdose with Aloxi, this should be managed with supportive care. \nDialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is \nunlikely to be an effective treatment for Aloxi overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, Serotonin (5HT3) antagonists, ATC code: \nA04AA05 \n \nPalonosetron is a selective high-affinity receptor antagonist of the 5HT3 receptor. \nIn a multicentre, randomised, double-blind active control clinical trial of 635 patients set to receive \nmoderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. A single-dose of 250 mcg, 500 mcg, or 750 mcg oral \npalonosetron capsules given one hour prior to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy was compared to \na single-dose of 250 mcg intravenous Aloxi given 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Patients were \nrandomised to either dexamethasone or placebo in addition to their assigned treatment.  The majority \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nof patients in the study were women (73 %), white (69 %), and naïve to previous chemotherapy \n(59 %). The antiemetic activity was observed during 0-24 hours, 24-120 hours and 0-120 hours.  \nEfficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of oral palonosetron doses compared to the \napproved intravenous formulation. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the two-\nsided 98.3 % confidence interval for the difference in complete response rates of oral palonosetron \ndose minus approved intravenous formulation was larger than -15 %. The non-inferiority margin was \n15 %.   \n \nAs shown in Table 1, oral Aloxi capsules 500 micrograms demonstrated non-inferiority to the active \ncomparator during the 0 to 24 hour and 0 to 120 hour time intervals; however, for the 24 to 120 hour \ntime period, non-inferiority was not shown. \n \nAlthough comparative efficacy of palonosetron in multiple cycles has not been demonstrated in \ncontrolled clinical trials, 217 patients were enrolled in a multicentre, open label safety study and were \ntreated with palonosetron capsules 750 micrograms for up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy in a total of \n654 chemotherapy cycles. Approximately 74 % of patients also received single dose oral or \nintravenous dexamethasone 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Complete Response was not formally \nevaluated for the repeat cycle application. However, in general the antiemetic effect for the 0-24 hour \ninterval was similar throughout the consecutively repeated cycles and the overall safety was \nmaintained during all cycles. \n\nTable 1: Proportion of patientsa responding by treatment group and phase   \n\n \nAloxi Oral \n\n500 micrograms  \n(n=160) \n\nAloxi Intravenous \n250 micrograms  \n\n(n=162) \n\nDelta \n \n\n % % %  \nComplete Response (No Emesis and No Rescue Medication)                        98.3 % CIb \n0-24 hours 76.3 70.4 5.9    [-6.5 %, 18.2 %] \n24-120 hours 62.5 65.4 -2.9    [-16.3 %, 10.5 %] \n0-120 hours 58.8 59.3 -0.5   [-14.2 %, 13.2 %] \nComplete Control (Complete Response and No More Than Mild Nausea)   p-valuec  \n0-24 hours 74.4 68.5 5.9 NS  \n24-120 hours 56.3 62.3 -6.0 NS  \n0-120 hours 52.5 56.2 -3.7 NS  \nNo Nausea (Likert Scale)                                                                                     p-valuec  \n0-24 hours 58.8 57.4 1.4   NS  \n24-120 hours 49.4 47.5 1.9   NS  \n0-120 hours 45.6 42.6 3.0   NS  \n\na Intent-to-treat cohort \nb The study was designed to show non-inferiority.

Significance levels at alpha 0.0167 (adjusted for multiple comparisons). \n \nIn non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular \nde- and re-polarisation and to prolong action potential duration. \nThe effect of palonosetron on QTc interval was evaluated in a double blind, randomised, parallel, \nplacebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled trial in adult men and women. The objective was to \nevaluate the ECG effects of IV administered palonosetron at single doses of 0.25, 0.75 or 2.25 mg in \n221 healthy subjects. The study demonstrated no effect on QT/QTc interval duration as well as any \nother ECG interval at doses up to 2.25 mg. No clinically significant changes were shown on heart \nrate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction and cardiac repolarization. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nPaediatric population \nPrevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV):  \nThe safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of 3µg/kg and 10µg/kg was investigated in \nthe first clinical study in 72 patients in the following age groups, >28 days to 23 months (12 patients), \n2 to 11 years (31 patients), and 12 to 17 years of age (29 patients), receiving highly or moderately \nemetogenic chemotherapy.  No safety concerns were raised at either dose level. The primary efficacy \nvariable was the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR, defined as no emetic episode \nand no rescue medication) during the first 24 hours after the start of chemotherapy administration. \nEfficacy after palonosetron 10 µg/kg compared to palonosetron 3µg/kg was 54.1% and 37.1% \nrespectively. \n \nThe efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric \ncancer patients was demonstrated in a second non-inferiority pivotal trial comparing a single \nintravenous infusion of palonosetron versus an i.v. ondansetron regimen. A total of 493 paediatric \npatients, aged 64 days to 16.9 years, receiving moderately (69.2%) or highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy (30.8%) were treated with palonosetron 10 µg/kg (maximum 0.75 mg), palonosetron \n20 µg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) or ondansetron (3 x 0.15 mg/kg , maximum total dose 32 mg) 30 \nminutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy during Cycle 1. Most patients were non-naïve \nto chemotherapy (78.5%) across all treatment groups. Emetogenic chemotherapies administered \nincluded doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m2), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, \ncarboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered \nwith chemotherapy in 55% of patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was Complete Response in the \nacute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy, defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue \nmedication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating \nnon-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority \ncriteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete \nResponse rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. In \nthe palonosetron 10 µg/kg, 20 µg/kg and ondansetron groups, the proportion of patients with CR0-24h \nwas 54.2%, 59.4% and 58.6%. Since the 97.5% confidence interval (stratum adjusted Mantel-\nHaenszel test) of the difference in CR0-24h between palonosetron 20 µg/kg and ondansetron was [-\n11.7%, 12.4%], the 20 µg/kg palonosetron dose demonstrated non-inferiority to ondansetron.  \n \nWhile this study demonstrated that paediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults \nto prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the \nestablished profile in adults (see section 4.8). Pharmacokinetic information is provided in section 5.2. \n \nPrevention of Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV): \nTwo paediatric trials were performed. The safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of \n1µg/kg and 3µg/kg was compared in the first clinical study in 150 patients in the following age \ngroups, >28 days to 23 months (7 patients), 2 to 11 years (96 patients), and 12 to 16 years of age (47 \npatients) undergoing elective surgery. No safety concerns were raised in either treatment group. The \nproportion of patients without emesis during 0-72 hours post-operatively was similar after \npalonosetron 1 µg/kg or 3 µg/kg (88% vs 84%). \n \nThe second paediatric trial was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel \ngroup, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, comparing i.v. palonosetron (1 µg/kg, max \n0.075 mg) versus i.v. ondansetron. A total of 670 paediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days \nto 16.9 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and \nno antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of \npatients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-\ninferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority \nconfidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, \n1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated No new safety concerns were raised in either \ntreatment group. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nPlease see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nUAbsorption  \nFollowing oral administration, palonosetron is well absorbed with its absolute bioavailability reaching \n97 %.  After single oral doses using buffered solution mean maximum palonosetron concentrations \n(Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) were dose proportional over the dose \nrange of 3.0 to 80 µg/kg in healthy subjects. \n \nIn 36 healthy male and female subjects given a single oral dose of palonosetron capsules \n500 micrograms, maximum plasma palonosetron concentration (Cmax) was 0.81 ± 0.17 ng/ml (mean ± \nSD) and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was 5.1 ± 1.7 hours. In female subjects (n=18), the \nmean AUC was 35 % higher and the mean Cmax was 26 % higher than in male subjects (n=18). \nIn 12 cancer patients given a single oral dose of palonosetron capsules 500 micrograms one hour prior \nto chemotherapy, Cmax was 0.93 ± 0.34 ng/ml and Tmax was 5.1 ± 5.9 hours.  The AUC was 30 % \nhigher in cancer patients than in healthy subjects.   \n \nA high fat meal did not affect the Cmax and AUC of oral palonosetron. Therefore, Aloxi capsules may \nbe taken without regard to meals.  \n \nUDistribution \nPalonosetron at the recommended dose is widely distributed in the body with a volume of distribution \nof approximately 6.9 to 7.9 l/kg.  Approximately 62 % of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. \n \nUBiotransformation \nPalonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40 % eliminated through the kidney and with \napproximately 50 % metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1 % of the \n5HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that \nCYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of \npalonosetron.  However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between \npoor and extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. Palonosetron does not inhibit or induce \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nUElimination \nFollowing administration of a single oral 750 micrograms dose of [14C]-palonosetron to six healthy \nsubjects, 85 % to 93 % of the total radioactivity was excreted in urine, and 5 % to 8 % was eliminated \nin feces. The amount of unchanged palonosetron excreted in the urine represented approximately \n40 % of the administered dose.  In healthy subjects given palonosetron capsules 500 micrograms, the \nterminal elimination half-life (t½) of palonosetron was 37 ± 12 hours (mean ± SD), and in cancer \npatients, t½ was 48 ± 19 hours.  After a single-dose of approximately 0.75 mg intravenous \npalonosetron, the total body clearance of palonosetron in healthy subjects was 160 ± 35 ml/h/kg \n(mean ± SD) and renal clearance was 66.5 ± 18.2 ml/h/kg. \n \nUPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nElderly people \nAge does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nGender \nGender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dose adjustment is necessary based \non gender. \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nPaediatric patients \n \nSingle-dose i.v. Aloxi pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of paediatric cancer patients \n(n=280) that received 10 µg/kg or 20 µg/kg. When the dose was increased from10 µg/kg to 20 µg/kg \na dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Following single dose intravenous infusion \nof Aloxi 20 µg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were \nhighly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years than in older paediatric \npatients. Median half-life was 29.5 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours \nacross age groups after administration of 20 µg/kg. \n \nThe total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. \nThere are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg. \n \n \nTable 2: Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Paediatric Cancer Patients following intravenous \ninfusion of Aloxi at 20 µg/kg over 15 min and in Adult Cancer Patients receiving 3 and 10 µg/kg \npalonosetron doses via intravenous bolus. \n\n Paediatric Cancer Patientsa Adults Cancer \nPatientsb \n\n <2 y 2 to <6 y 6 to <12 \ny \n\n12 to <17 \ny \n\n3.0 \nµg/kg \n\n10 µg/kg \n\n N=3 N=5 N=7 N=10 N=6 N=5 \n\nAUC0-∞, h·µg/L 69.0 \n(49.5) \n\n103.5 \n(40.4) \n\n98.7 \n(47.7) \n\n124.5 \n(19.1) \n\n35.8 \n(20.9) \n\n81.8 \n(23.9) \n\nt½, hours 24.0 28 23.3 30.5 \n56.4 \n\n(5.81) \n49.8 \n\n(14.4) \n\n N=6 N=14 N=13 N=19 N=6 N=5 \n\nClearance c, L/h/kg 0.31 \n(34.7) \n\n0.23 \n(51.3) \n\n0.19 \n(46.8) \n\n0.16 \n(27.8) \n\n0.10 \n(0.04) \n\n0.13 \n(0.05) \n\nVolume of distribution c, d, L/kg 6.08 \n(36.5) \n\n5.29 \n(57.8) \n\n6.26 \n(40.0) \n\n6.20 \n(29.0) \n\n7.91 \n(2.53) \n\n9.56 \n(4.21) \n\na PK parameters expressed as Geometric Mean (CV) except for T½ which is median. \nb PK parameters expressed as Arithmetic mean (SD) \nc Clearance and Volume of distribution in paediatric patients were calculated weight-adjusted from both 10 µg \n/kg and 20 µg /kg dose groups combined. In adults, different dose levels are indicated in column title. \nd Vss is reported for paediatric cancer patients, whereas Vz is reported for adult cancer patients. \n \nRenal impairment \nMild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic \nparameters.  Severe renal impairment reduces renal clearance, however total body clearance in these \npatients is similar to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. No pharmacokinetic data in haemodialysis patients are available. \n \nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the \nhealthy subjects. While the terminal elimination half-life and mean systemic exposure of palonosetron \nis increased in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment, this does not warrant dose reduction. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of \nthe maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nNon-clinical studies indicate that palonosetron, only at very high concentrations, may block ion \nchannels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and prolong action potential duration. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Only limited data from animal \nstudies are available regarding the placental transfer (see section 4.6). \n \nPalonosetron is not mutagenic. High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 15 times the \nhuman therapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, \nendocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not \nin mice.  \n \nThe underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because of the high doses employed and \nsince Aloxi is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not considered relevant for \nclinical use. \n \n \n\n 6.

This belongs to a group of medicines called \n‘serotonin (5HT3) antagonists’.  \n \nAloxi is used in adults, adolescents and children over one month of age to help stop you feeling or \nbeing sick (nausea and vomiting) when having cancer treatments called chemotherapy. \n \nIt works by blocking the action of a chemical called serotonin, which can cause you to feel sick or to \nvomit.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Aloxi \n \nDo not take Aloxi if: \n• you are allergic to palonosetron or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nYou will not be given Aloxi if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor \nor nurse before you are given this medicine.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Aloxi if: \n• you have a blocked bowel or have had repeated constipation in the past  \n• you have had heart problems or heart problems run in your family, such as changes in your heart \n\nbeat (‘QT prolongation’) \n• you have an imbalance of certain minerals in your blood which has not been treated - such as \n\npotassium and magnesium. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are \ngiven Aloxi. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nOther medicines and Aloxi \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
