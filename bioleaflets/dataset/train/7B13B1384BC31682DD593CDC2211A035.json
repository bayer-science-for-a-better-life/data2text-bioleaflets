No \ndata are available.\n\nGeneral\nEfficacy data in combination with other corticosteroids and 5-HT3 antagonists are limited. For \nadditional information on the co-administration with corticosteroids, see section 4.5.\n\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist medicinal \nproducts.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly (\u226565 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nGender\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage \nrenal disease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nIVEMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nMethod of administration\nIVEMEND 150 mg should be administered intravenously and should not be given by the \nintramuscular or subcutaneous route. Intravenous administration in adults occurs preferably through a \nrunning intravenous infusion over 20-30 minutes. Intravenous administration in paediatric patients \naged 6 months and older is recommended through a central venous catheter and should be \nadministered over 30 minutes in patients aged 12 years and older or over 60 minutes in patients less \nthan 12 years of age (see section 6.6). Do not administer IVEMEND as a bolus injection or undiluted \nsolution. \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to polysorbate 80 or any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. IVEMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP3A4 interactions\nIVEMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant active substances that are \nmetabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such as ciclosporin, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and quinidine (see \nsection 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be approached with \nparticular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity. \n\nCo-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be \nmonitored closely for 14 days following the use of fosaprepitant (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with hormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof fosaprepitant. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with fosaprepitant and for 2 months following the use of fosaprepitant (see section 4.5).\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, erythema, dyspnoea, and \nanaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock have occurred during or soon after infusion of fosaprepitant. These \nhypersensitivity reactions have generally responded to discontinuation of the infusion and \nadministration of appropriate therapy. It is not recommended to reinitiate the infusion in patients who \nexperience hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nAdministration and infusion site reactions\nInfusion site reactions (ISRs) have been reported with the use of IVEMEND (see section 4.8). The \nmajority of severe ISRs, including thrombophlebitis and vasculitis, were reported with concomitant \nvesicant (e.g., anthracycline-based) chemotherapy administration, particularly when associated with \nextravasation. Necrosis was also reported in some patients with concomitant vesicant chemotherapy.\nMild injection site thrombosis has been observed at higher doses without concomitant vesicant \nchemotherapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nIVEMEND should not be given as a bolus injection, but should always be diluted and given as a slow \nintravenous infusion (see section 4.2). IVEMEND should not be administered intramuscularly or \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.3). If signs or symptoms of local irritation occur, the injection or \ninfusion should be terminated and restarted in another vein.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nWhen administered intravenously fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant.\n\nFosaprepitant 150 mg, given as a single dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Fosaprepitant does not\nseem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral \naprepitant with digoxin. It is anticipated that fosaprepitant would cause less or no greater induction of \nCYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation than that caused by the administration of oral aprepitant. Data\nare lacking regarding effects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products following administration of intravenous fosaprepitant are \nlikely to occur with active substances that interact with oral aprepitant. The potential for interactions \nwith multi-day fosaprepitant regimens are anticipated to be no greater than those for oral aprepitant \nregimens. Therefore, the recommendations for use of IVEMEND with other medicinal products in \npaediatric patients are based upon adult data from fosaprepitant and aprepitant studies. When using \ncombined IVEMEND and EMEND regimens, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics \n(SmPC) section 4.5 for EMEND capsules or EMEND for oral suspension.\n\nThe following information was derived from studies conducted with oral aprepitant and studies \nconducted with intravenous single dose fosaprepitant co-administered with dexamethasone, \nmidazolam, or diltiazem.\n\nEffect of fosaprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances\nCYP3A4 inhibition\nAs a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, the fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose can cause a transient increase \nin plasma concentrations of co-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. \nThe total exposure of CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 after co-\nadministration with a single 150 mg fosaprepitant dose. Fosaprepitant must not be used concurrently\nwith pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by fosaprepitant could \nresult in elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.3). Caution is advised during concomitant administration of \nfosaprepitant and active substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a \nnarrow therapeutic range, such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil,\ndiergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine (see section 4.4).\n\nCorticosteroids\nDexamethasone: The oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when \nco-administered with fosaprepitant (see section 4.2). Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single \nintravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC0-24hr of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 100 % \non Day 1, 86 % on Day 2 and 18 % on Day 3 when dexamethasone was co-administered as a single \n8 mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3.\n\nChemotherapeutic medicinal products\nInteraction studies with fosaprepitant 150 mg and chemotherapeutic medicinal products have not been \nconducted; however, based on studies with oral aprepitant and docetaxel and vinorelbine, IVEMEND \n150 mg is not expected to have a clinically relevant interaction with intravenously administered \ndocetaxel and vinorelbine. An interaction with orally administered chemotherapeutic medicinal \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nproducts metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g., etoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be \nexcluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be appropriate in patients receiving \nmedicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see section 4.4). Postmarketing \nevents of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have been reported after aprepitant \nand ifosfamide co-administration.\n\nImmunosuppressants\nFollowing a single 150 mg fosaprepitant dose, a transient moderate increase for two days possibly \nfollowed by a mild decrease in exposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g.,\nciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of increased \nexposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant based on Therapeutic Dose Monitoring is not\nrecommended on the day of and the day after administration of IVEMEND.\n\nMidazolam\nFosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC0-\u221e of \nmidazolam by 77 % on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was co-administered as a \nsingle oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4. Fosaprepitant 150 mg is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor as a \nsingle dose on Day 1 with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4.\n\nThe potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines \nmetabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these \nmedicinal products with IVEMEND.\n\nDiltiazem\nInteraction studies with fosaprepitant 150 mg and diltiazem have not been conducted; however, the \nfollowing study with 100 mg of fosaprepitant should be considered when using IVEMEND 150 mg \nwith diltiazem. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, infusion of 100 mg of fosaprepitant \nover 15 minutes with diltiazem 120 mg 3 times daily, resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in diltiazem AUC \nand a small but clinically meaningful decrease in blood pressure, but did not result in a clinically \nmeaningful change in heart rate, or PR interval.\n\nInduction\nThe fosaprepitant 150 mg single dose did not induce CYP3A4 on Days 1 and 4 in the midazolam \ninteraction study. It is anticipated that IVEMEND would cause less or no greater induction of \nCYP2C9, CYP3A4, and glucuronidation than that caused by the administration of the 3-day oral \naprepitant regimen, for which a transient induction with its maximum effect 6-8 days after first \naprepitant dose has been observed. The 3-day oral aprepitant regimen resulted in an about 30-35 %\nreduction in AUC of CYP2C9 substrates and up to a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough \nconcentrations. Data are lacking regarding effects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised \nwhen warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide, phenytoin or other active substances that are known to \nbe metabolised by CYP2C9 are administered with IVEMEND.\n\nWarfarin\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely \nduring treatment with and for 14 days following the use of IVEMEND for the prevention of \nchemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). \n\nHormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof fosaprepitant. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with fosaprepitant and for 2 months following the use of fosaprepitant. \n\n5-HT3 antagonists\nInteraction studies with fosaprepitant 150 mg and 5-HT3 antagonists have not been conducted; \nhowever, in clinical interaction studies, the oral aprepitant regimen did not have clinically important \neffects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite \n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nof dolasetron). Therefore, there is no evidence of interaction with the use of IVEMEND 150 mg and \n5-HT3 antagonists.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant resulting from \nadministration of fosaprepitant 150 mg\nConcomitant administration of fosaprepitant with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity \n(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nnefazodone, and protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected \nto result in several-fold increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). Ketoconazole \nincreased the terminal half-life of oral aprepitant about 3-fold.\n\nConcomitant administration of fosaprepitant with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 \nactivity (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the \ncombination could result in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in \ndecreased efficacy. Concomitant administration of fosaprepitant with herbal preparations containing \nSt. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended. Rifampicin decreased the mean \nterminal half-life of oral aprepitant by 68 %.\n\nDiltiazem\nInteraction studies with fosaprepitant 150 mg and diltiazem have not been conducted; however, the \nfollowing study with 100 mg of fosaprepitant should be considered when using IVEMEND 150 mg \nwith diltiazem. Infusion of 100 mg fosaprepitant over 15 minutes with diltiazem 120 mg 3 times daily, \nresulted in a 1.5-fold increase of aprepitant AUC. This effect was not considered clinically important.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof fosaprepitant. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with fosaprepitant and for 2 months following the last dose of fosaprepitant (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nFor fosaprepitant and aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential \nfor reproductive toxicities of fosaprepitant and aprepitant have not been fully characterised, since \nexposure levels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. \nThese studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential \neffects on reproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. IVEMEND should not be \nused during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats after intravenous administration of fosaprepitant as \nwell as after oral administration of aprepitant. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in human \nmilk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with IVEMEND. \n\nFertility\nThe potential for effects of fosaprepitant and aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised \nbecause exposure levels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal \nstudies. These fertility studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating\nperformance, fertility, embryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nIVEMEND may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue\nmay occur following administration of IVEMEND (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical studies, various formulations of fosaprepitant have been administered to a total of\n2,687 adults including 371 healthy subjects and 2,084 patients, and 199 children and adolescents with \nchemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Since fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant, \nthose adverse reactions associated with aprepitant are expected to occur with fosaprepitant. The safety \nprofile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults and 184 children and adolescents. \n\nOral aprepitant\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the \naprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving HEC were: hiccups (4.6 % versus \n2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8 % versus 1.1 %), dyspepsia (2.6 % versus \n2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache (2.0 % versus 1.8 %), and decreased appetite \n(2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse reaction reported at a greater incidence in patients \ntreated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving MEC was fatigue \n(1.4 % versus 0.9 %).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with \nthe aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer \nchemotherapy were hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions - aprepitant\nThe following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a \ngreater incidence with oral aprepitant than with standard therapy in adults or paediatric patients or in \npost-marketing use.\n\nThe frequency categories given in the table are based on the studies in adults; the observed \nfrequencies in the paediatric studies were similar or lower, unless shown in the table. Some less \ncommon ADRs in the adult population were not observed in the paediatric studies.\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).\n\nTable 5: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \u2013 aprepitant\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nInfection and infestations candidiasis, staphylococcal infection rare\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nfebrile neutropenia, anaemia uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions\n\nnot known\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\ndecreased appetite common\npolydipsia rare\n\nPsychiatric disorders anxiety uncommon\ndisorientation, euphoric mood rare\n\nNervous system disorders headache common\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\ndizziness, somnolence uncommon\ncognitive disorder, lethargy, dysgeusia rare\n\nEye disorders conjunctivitis rare\nEar and labyrinth disorders tinnitus rare\nCardiac disorders palpitations uncommon\n\nbradycardia, cardiovascular disorder rare\nVascular disorders hot flush/flushing uncommon\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nhiccups common\noropharyngeal pain, sneezing, cough, \npostnasal drip, throat irritation\n\nrare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders constipation, dyspepsia common\neructation, nausea*, vomiting*, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal \npain, dry mouth, flatulence\n\nuncommon\n\nduodenal ulcer perforation, stomatitis, \nabdominal distension, faeces hard, \nneutropenic colitis\n\nrare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nrash, acne uncommon\nphotosensitivity reaction, hyperhidrosis, \nseborrhoea, skin lesion, rash pruritic, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nrare\n\npruritus, urticaria not known\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nmuscular weakness, muscle spasms rare\n\nRenal and urinary disorders dysuria uncommon\npollakisuria rare\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nfatigue common\nasthenia, malaise uncommon\noedema, chest discomfort, gait disturbance rare\n\nInvestigations ALT increased common\nAST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased\n\nuncommon\n\nred blood cells urine positive, blood sodium \ndecreased, weight decreased, neutrophil count \ndecreased, glucose urine present, urine output \nincreased\n\nrare\n\n*Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5-days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were \nreported as adverse reactions only thereafter.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions profiles in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies in adults for \nup to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.\n\nIn an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 adult patients receiving aprepitant and HEC,\nthe adverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with \naprepitant.\n\nAdditional adverse reactions were observed in adult patients treated with aprepitant for post-operative \nnausea and vomiting (PONV) and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, \nbowel sounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, \nsensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.\n*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nFosaprepitant\nIn an active-controlled clinical study in adult patients receiving HEC, safety was evaluated for \n1,143 patients receiving the 1-day regimen of IVEMEND 150 mg compared to 1,169 patients \nreceiving the 3-day regimen of aprepitant. Additionally, in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in adult\npatients receiving MEC, safety was evaluated for 504 patients receiving a single dose of IVEMEND\n150 mg compared to 497 patients receiving the control regimen.\n\nIn a pooled analysis of 3 active-controlled clinical studies in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to \n17 years) receiving either HEC or MEC and a single dose of IVEMEND at or above the recommended \n1-day regimen dose, safety was evaluated for 139 patients receiving the 1-day regimen of IVEMEND. \nIn the same analysis, safety was evaluated for 199 patients receiving either HEC or MEC and a single \ndose of IVEMEND at or above the recommended 3-day regimen of IVEMEND. Safety data following \nthe administration of the 3-day IV/oral/oral regimen were also included.\n\nNo data are available following the administration of a 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric \npatients. The safety profile of the 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients is expected to \nbe similar to that of the 1-day fosaprepitant regimen as the low daily trough levels do not significantly \nincrease the exposures on subsequent days.\n\nThe safety profile of fosaprepitant in adult and paediatric patients was generally similar to that \nobserved with aprepitant.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \u2013 fosaprepitant\nThe following are adverse reactions reported in adult patients receiving fosaprepitant in clinical \nstudies or post-marketing that have not been reported with aprepitant as described above. The \nfrequency categories in the table are based on studies in adults; the observed frequencies in the \npaediatric studies were similar or lower. Some adverse reactions that are commonly observed in the \nadult population were not observed in the paediatric studies. Infusion site reactions (ISRs) have been \nreported with the use of IVEMEND (see section 4.4).\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).\n\nTable 6: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \u2013 fosaprepitant\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nVascular disorders flushing, thrombophlebitis (predominantly, \n\ninfusion site thrombophlebitis)\nuncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nerythema uncommon\n\nGeneral disorders and\nadministration site conditions\n\ninfusion site erythema, infusion site pain, \ninfusion site pruritus\n\nuncommon\n\ninfusion site induration rare\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions\nincluding flushing, erythema, dyspnoea, \nanaphylactic reactions/anaphylactic shock\n\nnot known\n\nInvestigations blood pressure increased uncommon\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, fosaprepitant should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective.\n\nAprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12.\n\nFosaprepitant is the prodrug of aprepitant and when administered intravenously is converted rapidly \nto aprepitant (see section 5.2). The contribution of fosaprepitant to the overall antiemetic effect has \nnot fully been characterised, but a transient contribution during the initial phase cannot be ruled out. \nAprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. \nThe pharmacological effect of fosaprepitant is attributed to aprepitant.\n\n1-Day Regimen of Fosaprepitant in Adults\nHighly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC)\nIn a randomised, parallel, double-blind, active-controlled study, IVEMEND 150 mg (N=1,147) was \ncompared with a 3-day aprepitant regimen (N=1,175) in adult patients receiving a HEC regimen that \nincluded cisplatin (\u2265 70 mg/m2). The fosaprepitant regimen consisted of fosaprepitant 150 mg on \nDay 1 in combination with ondansetron 32 mg IV on Day 1 and dexamethasone 12 mg on Day 1, 8 mg \non Day 2, and 8 mg twice daily on Days 3 and 4. The aprepitant regimen consisted of aprepitant \n125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 in combination with ondansetron 32 mg IV on \nDay 1 and dexamethasone 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily on Days 2 through 4. Fosaprepitant \nplacebo, aprepitant placebo, and dexamethasone placebo (in the evenings on Days 3 and 4) were used \nto maintain blinding (see section 4.2). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron was used in \nclinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product information for the selected \n5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.\n\nEfficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measures: complete response in both the \noverall and delayed phases and no vomiting in the overall phase. IVEMEND 150 mg was shown to be \nnon-inferior to that of the 3-day regimen of aprepitant. A summary of the primary and secondary \nendpoints is shown in Table 7.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nTable 7: Percent of adult patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy \nresponding by treatment group and phase \u2014 Cycle 1\n\nENDPOINTS* Fosaprepitant \nregimen\n\n(N =1,106)**\n\n%\n\nAprepitant\nregimen\n\n(N =1,134)**\n\n%\n\nDifference\u2020\n\n(95 % CI) \n\nComplete response\u2021\n\nOverall\u00a7 71.9 72.3 -0.4 (-4.1, 3.3)\nDelayed phase\u00a7\u00a7 74.3 74.2 0.1 (-3.5, 3.7)\n\nNo vomiting\nOverall\u00a7 72.9 74.6 -1.7 (-5.3, 2.0)\n\n*Primary endpoint is bolded.\n**N: Number of adult patients included in the primary analysis of complete response.\n\u2020Difference and confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the method proposed by Miettinen\nand Nurminen and adjusted for gender.\n\u2021Complete response = no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy.\n\u00a7Overall = 0 to 120 hours post-initiation of cisplatin chemotherapy.\n\u00a7\u00a7Delayed phase = 25 to 120 hours post-initiation of cisplatin chemotherapy.\n\nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC)\nIn a randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, IVEMEND 150 mg (N=502) in \ncombination with ondansetron and dexamethasone was compared with ondansetron and \ndexamethasone alone (control regimen) (N=498) in adult patients receiving a moderately emetogenic \nchemotherapy regimen. The fosaprepitant regimen consisted of fosaprepitant 150 mg on Day 1 in \ncombination with oral ondansetron 8 mg for 2 doses and oral dexamethasone 12 mg. On Days 2 and 3, \npatients in the fosaprepitant group received placebo for ondansetron every 12 hours. The control \nregimen consisted of fosaprepitant placebo 150 mg IV on Day 1 in combination with oral ondansetron \n8 mg for 2 doses and oral dexamethasone 20 mg. On Days 2 and 3, patients in the control group \nreceived 8 mg oral ondansetron every 12 hours. Fosaprepitant placebo and dexamethasone placebo \n(on Day 1) were used to maintain blinding.\n\nThe efficacy of fosaprepitant was evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints listed in \nTable 8 and was shown to be superior to the control regimen with regard to complete response in the \ndelayed and overall phases.\n\nTable 8: Percent of adult patients receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy \nresponding by treatment group and phase\n\nENDPOINTS* Fosaprepitant \nregimen\n\n(N =502)**\n\n%\n\nControl \nregimen\n\n(N =498)**\n\n%\n\nP-Value\n\nComplete response\u2020\n\nDelayed phase\u2021 78.9 68.5 < 0.001\nComplete response\u2020\n\nOverall\u00a7 77.1 66.9 < 0.001\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nAcute phase\u00a7\u00a7 93.2 91 0.184\n\n*Primary endpoint is bolded.\n**N: Number of adult patients included in the intention to treat population.\n\u2020Complete response = no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy.\n\u2021Delayed phase = 25 to 120 hours post-initiation of chemotherapy.\n\u00a7Overall = 0 to 120 hours post-initiation of chemotherapy.\n\u00a7\u00a7Acute= 0 to 24 hours post-initiation of chemotherapy.\n\nThe estimated time to first emesis is depicted by the Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Percent of adult patients receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy \nwho remain emesis free over time\n\nP\ne\nrc\n\ne\nn\nt \no\nf \nP\n\na\ntie\n\nn\nts\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nTime(hours) Since the First MEC Administration\n\n0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120\n\nFosaprepitant Regimen(N=502)\nControl Regimen(N=498)\n\nPaediatric population\nIn 3 active-controlled, open-label clinical studies, paediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years \nreceived either highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and a single dose of fosaprepitant at or \nabove the recommended 1-day regimen dose (139 patients) or 3-day regimen (199 patients), in \ncombination with ondansetron with or without dexamethasone.\n\nPaediatric Patients Receiving 1-Day Fosaprepitant Regimen\nThe efficacy of the 1-day fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients was extrapolated from that \ndemonstrated in adults receiving the 1-day fosaprepitant regimen as described in the 1-Day Regimen \nof Fosaprepitant in Adults subsection.\n\nThe efficacy of a 1-day fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients is expected to be similar to that of \nthe 1-day adult fosaprepitant regimen.\n\nPaediatric Patients Receiving 3-Day Fosaprepitant Regimen\nThe efficacy of the 3-day fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients was based on that demonstrated \nin paediatric patients receiving the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen. \n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nThe efficacy of a 3-day fosaprepitant regimen in paediatric patients is expected to be similar to that of \nthe 3-day oral aprepitant regimen. See the summary of product characteristics for EMEND capsules\nand EMEND powder for oral suspension for complete clinical information regarding studies \nperformed with oral aprepitant.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, when administered intravenously is rapidly converted to \naprepitant. Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are below quantifiable levels within 30 minutes of \nthe completion of infusion.\n\nAprepitant after fosaprepitant administration\nFollowing a single intravenous 150 mg dose of fosaprepitant administered as a 20-minute infusion to \nhealthy adult volunteers, the mean AUC0-\u221e of aprepitant was 35.0 \u00b5g\uf0b7hr/ml and the mean maximal \naprepitant concentration was 4.01 \u00b5g/ml.\n\nDistribution\nAprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean volume of distribution \nat steady state (Vdss) of aprepitant estimated from a single 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant is \napproximately 82 l in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nFosaprepitant was rapidly converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with liver preparations from \nhumans. Furthermore, fosaprepitant underwent rapid and nearly complete conversion to aprepitant in \nS9 preparations from other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the \nconversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple tissues. In humans, fosaprepitant \nadministered intravenously was rapidly converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes following the end \nof infusion.\n\nAprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for \napproximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous \nadministration 100 mg dose of [14C]- fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial \npresence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in \nhuman plasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and \nits side chains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human \nliver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with \nminor contribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.\n\nAll metabolites observed in urine, faeces and plasma following an intravenous 100 mg [14C]-\nfosaprepitant dose were also observed following an oral dose of [14C]-aprepitant. Upon conversion of \n245.3 mg of fosaprepitant dimeglumine (equivalent to 150 mg fosaprepitant) to aprepitant, 23.9 mg of \nphosphoric acid and 95.3 mg of meglumine are liberated.\n\nElimination\nAprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary \nexcretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]- fosaprepitant \nto healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45 % in faeces.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aprepitant is non-linear across the clinical dose range. The terminal half-life \nof aprepitant following a 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant was approximately 11 hours. The \ngeometric mean plasma clearance of aprepitant following a 150 mg intravenous dose of fosaprepitant \nwas approximately 73 ml/min.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nHepatic impairment: Fosaprepitant is metabolised in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore hepatic \nimpairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant. Mild hepatic \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically \nrelevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \nConclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) on \naprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data. There are no clinical or \npharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).\n\nRenal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered to patients with severe \nrenal impairment (CrCl< 30 ml/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \nhaemodialysis.\n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) \ndecreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0-\uf0a5 of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by \n32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the \nAUC of pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with \nrenal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after \ndosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose \nwas recovered in the dialysate.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis.\n\nPaediatric population: As part of a 3-day IV/IV/IV regimen, simulated median AUC0-24hr of aprepitant\nwith median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) on Day 1 and the median concentrations at the end of\nDay 1, Day 2 and Day 3 in paediatric patients (6 months to 17 years old) are shown in Table 9.\n\nTable 9: Pharmacokinetic parameters of aprepitant for 3-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in \npaediatric patients\n\nPopulation 3-day IV/IV/IV \ndose \n\nAUC 0-24 hr.\n(ng*hr/mL)\n\nCmax\n(ng/mL)\n\nC24\n(ng/mL)\n\nC48\n(ng/mL)\n\nC72\n(ng/mL)\n\n12 - 17 years old 115 mg, 80 mg, \n80 mg\n\n21,172 2,475 454 424 417\n\n6 - < 12 years old\n\n3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, \n2 mg/kg\n\n25,901 2,719 518 438 418\n\n2 - < 6 years old 20,568 2,335 336 248 232\n\n6 months \u2013\n< 2 years old\n\n16,979 1,916 256 179 167\n\nIn the 1-day IV fosaprepitant setting, simulated median AUC0-24hr of aprepitant with median peak \nplasma concentration (Cmax) on Day 1 and the median concentrations at the end of Day 1, Day 2 \nand Day 3 in paediatric patients (6 months to < 12 years old) and observed mean AUC0-24hr with \nmedian peak plasma concentration (Cmax) on Day 1 and mean concentrations at the end of Day 1, Day \n2 and Day 3 in paediatric patients (12 to 17 years old) are shown in Table 10.\n\nTable 10: Pharmacokinetic parameters of aprepitant for 1-day IV fosaprepitant regimen in \npaediatric patients\n\nPopulation 1-day IV\ndose\n\nAUC 0-24 hr.\n(ng*hr/mL)\n\nCmax\n(ng/mL)\n\nC24\n(ng/mL)\n\nC48\n(ng/mL)\n\nC72\n(ng/mL)\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\n12 - 17 years old 150 mg 30,400 3,500 735 NR NR\n\n6 - < 12 years old\n4 mg/kg\n\n35,766 3,637 746 227 69.2\n\n2 - < 6 years old 28,655 3,150 494 108 23.5\n\n6 months \u2013\n<2 years old\n\n5 mg/kg 30,484 3,191 522 112 24.4\n\nNR = Not Reported\n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in paediatric patients (aged 6 months through \n17 years) suggests that gender and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof aprepitant.\n\nRelationship between concentration and effect\nPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies, using a highly specific NK1 receptor tracer, in \nhealthy young men administered a single intravenous dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant (N=8) \ndemonstrated brain NK1 receptor occupancy of \u2265 100 % at Tmax, and 24 hours, \u2265 97 % at 48 hours, and \nbetween 41 % and 75 % at 120 hours, following dosing. Occupancy of brain NK1 receptors, in this \nstudy, correlate well with aprepitant plasma concentrations.\n\n5.3 Pre-clinical safety data\n\nPre-clinical data obtained with intravenous administration of fosaprepitant and oral administration of \naprepitant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated\ndose toxicity, genotoxicity (including in vitro tests), and toxicity to reproduction and development.\n\nCarcinogenic potential in rodents was only investigated with orally administered aprepitant. However, \nit should be noted that the value of the toxicity studies carried out with rodents, rabbits and monkeys, \nincluding the reproduction toxicity studies, are limited since systemic exposures to fosaprepitant and \naprepitant were only similar or even lower than therapeutic exposure in adult humans. In the \nperformed safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies with dogs, fosaprepitant Cmax and \naprepitant AUC values were up to 3 times and 40 times, respectively, higher than clinical values.\n\nIn a toxicity study in juvenile dogs treated with fosaprepitant from postnatal day 14 to day 42, a \ndecreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and increased \nuterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were seen in \nfemales from 4 mg/kg/day. In a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated with aprepitant from postnatal \nday 10 to day 63, earlier vaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and delayed preputial \nseparation in males from 10 mg/kg b.i.d was seen. There were no treatment-related effects on mating, \nfertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes in the reproductive organs. There \nwere no margins to clinically relevant exposure of aprepitant. For short term treatment, these findings \nare considered unlikely to be clinically relevant.\n\nIn laboratory animals, fosaprepitant in non-commercial formulations caused vascular toxicity and \nhaemolysis at concentrations below 1 mg/ml and higher, dependent on the formulation. In human \nwashed blood cells also evidence of haemolysis was found with non-commercial formulations at \nfosaprepitant concentrations of 2.3 mg/ml and higher, although tests in human whole blood were \nnegative. No haemolysis was found with the commercial formulation up to a fosaprepitant \nconcentration of 1 mg/ml in human whole blood and washed human erythrocytes.\n\nIn rabbits, fosaprepitant caused initial transient local acute inflammation following paravenous, \nsubcutaneous and intramuscular administration. At the end of the follow-up period (post-dose day 8), \nup to slight local subacute inflammation was noted following paravenous and intramuscular \n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nadministration and additional up to moderate focal muscle degeneration/necrosis with muscle \nregeneration following intramuscular administration.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What IVEMEND is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use IVEMEND\n3. How to use IVEMEND\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IVEMEND\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IVEMEND is and what it is used for\n\nIVEMEND contains the active substance fosaprepitant which is converted to aprepitant in your body. \nIt belongs to a group of medicines called \"neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists\". The brain has a \nspecific area that controls nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND works by blocking signals to that area, \nthereby reducing nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND is used in adults, adolescents, and children aged \n6 months or older in combination with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by \nchemotherapy (cancer treatment) that is a strong or moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use IVEMEND\n\nDo not use IVEMEND\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to fosaprepitant, aprepitant, or to polysorbate 80 or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\uf0b7 with medicines containing pimozide (used to treat psychiatric illnesses), terfenadine and \n\nastemizole (used for hay fever and other allergic conditions), cisapride (used for treating \ndigestive problems). Tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines since the treatment must \nbe modified before you start using IVEMEND.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using IVEMEND.\n\nBefore treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor if you have liver disease because the liver is \nimportant in breaking down the medicine in the body. Your doctor may therefore have to monitor the \ncondition of your liver.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give IVEMEND to children under 6 months of age or who weigh less than 6 kg, because it has \nnot been studied in this population.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nOther medicines and IVEMEND\nIVEMEND can affect other medicines both during and after treatment with IVEMEND. There are \nsome medicines that should not be taken with IVEMEND (such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, \nand cisapride) or that require a dose adjustment (see also \u2018Do not use IVEMEND\u2019). \n\nThe effects of IVEMEND or other medicines might be influenced if you take IVEMEND together \nwith other medicines including those listed below. Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are \ntaking any of the following medicines:\n\n- birth control medicines which can include birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain \nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones may not work adequately when taken \ntogether with IVEMEND. Another or additional non-hormonal form of birth control should be \nused during treatment with IVEMEND and for up to 2 months after using IVEMEND,\n\n- ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus (immunosuppressants), \n- alfentanil, fentanyl (used to treat pain), \n- quinidine (used to treat an irregular heart beat),\n- irinotecan, etoposide, vinorelbine, ifosfamide (medicines used to treat cancer),\n- medicines containing ergot alkaloid derivatives such as ergotamine and diergotamine (used for \n\ntreating migraines),\n- warfarin, acenocoumarol (blood thinners; blood tests may be required),\n- rifampicin, clarithromycin, telithromycin (antibiotics used to treat infections),\n- phenytoin (a medicine used to treat seizures), \n- carbamazepine (used to treat depression and epilepsy),\n- midazolam, triazolam, phenobarbital (medicines used to produce calmness or help you sleep),\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (an herbal preparation used to treat depression), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV infections),\n- ketoconazole except shampoo (used to treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome \u2013 when the body produces an \n\nexcess of cortisol),\n- itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole (antifungals),\n- nefazodone (used to treat depression),\n- diltiazem (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure),\n- corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone),\n- anti-anxiety medicines (such as alprazolam), \n- tolbutamide (a medicine used to treat diabetes).\n\nTell your doctor about any other medicines or herbal medicines you are taking, have recently taken, or \nmight take.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nThis medicine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding, may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before \nreceiving this medicine.\n\nFor information regarding birth control, see \u2018Other medicines and IVEMEND\u2019.\n\nIt is not known whether IVEMEND is excreted in human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during treatment with this medicine. It is important to tell your doctor if you are \nbreast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed before receiving this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIt should be taken into account that some people get dizzy and get sleepy after using IVEMEND.

How to use IVEMEND\n\nIn adults (18 years of age and older), the recommended dose of IVEMEND is 150 mg fosaprepitant on \nDay 1 (day of chemotherapy). \n\nIn children and adolescents (6 months to 17 years of age), the recommended dose of IVEMEND is\nbased on the patient\u2019s age and weight. Depending on the chemotherapy treatment, there are two ways \nIVEMEND may be given:\n\nIVEMEND is given only on Day 1 (single day of chemotherapy)\nIVEMEND is given on Day 1, 2, and 3 (single or multiple days of chemotherapy)\n\no Oral formulations of aprepitant may be prescribed on Days 2 and 3 instead of IVEMEND.\n\nThe powder is reconstituted and diluted before use. The solution for infusion is given to you by a \nhealth care professional, such as a doctor or nurse, via an intravenous infusion (a drip) approximately \n30 minutes before you start the chemotherapy treatment in adults or 60 \u2013 90 minutes before you start \nthe chemotherapy treatment in children and adolescents. Your doctor may ask you to take other \nmedicines including a corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone) and a \u20185HT3 antagonist\u2019 (such as\nondansetron) for preventing nausea and vomiting. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not \nsure.\n\n4.

Inject 5 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into the vial. Assure that \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection is added to the vial along the vial wall \nin order to prevent foaming. Swirl the vial gently. Avoid shaking and jetting sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into the vial.\n\n2. Prepare an infusion bag filled with 145 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection (for example, by removing 105 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection from a 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection infusion bag).\n\n3. Withdraw the entire volume from the vial and transfer it into an infusion bag containing 145 ml \nof sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection to yield a total volume of 150 ml\nand final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Gently invert the bag 2-3 times (see \u2018How to use \nIVEMEND\u2019).\n\n4. Determine the volume to be administered from this prepared infusion bag, based on the \nrecommended dose (see Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC), section 4.2).\n\nAdults\nThe entire volume of the prepared infusion bag (150 ml) should be administered.\n\nPaediatrics\nIn patients 12 years and older, the volume to be administered is calculated as follows: \n\n\uf0b7 Volume to administer (ml) equals the recommended dose (mg) \n\nIn patients 6 months to less than 12 years, the volume to be administered is calculated as \nfollows:\n\n\uf0b7 Volume to administer (ml) = recommended dose (mg/kg) x weight (kg) \no Note: Do not exceed maximum doses (see Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristic (SmPC), section 4.2).\n\n5. If necessary, for volumes less than 150 ml, the calculated volume can be transferred to an\nappropriate size bag or syringe prior to administration by infusion.\n\nThe reconstituted and diluted final solution is stable for 24 hours at 25\uf0b0C.\n\nParenteral medicines should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before \nadministration whenever solution and container permit.\n\nThe appearance of the reconstituted solution is the same as the appearance of the diluent.\n\nDiscard any remaining solution and waste material. Any unused medicinal product or waste material \nshould be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\nThe medicinal product must not be reconstituted or mixed with solutions for which physical and \nchemical compatibility has not been established (see Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC),\nsection 6.2).\n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
