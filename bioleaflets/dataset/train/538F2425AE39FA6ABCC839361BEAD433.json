This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZurampic 200 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of lesinurad.\n\nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 52.92 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nOval, 5.7 x 12.9 mm, blue tablets.\n\nTablets are engraved with \u201cLES200\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZurampic, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated in adults for the adjunctive \ntreatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target \nserum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of Zurampic is 200 mg once daily in the morning. This is also the maximum \ndose (see section 4.4).\n\nZurampic tablets must be co-administered at the same time as the morning dose of a xanthine oxidase \ninhibitor, i.e. allopurinol or febuxostat. The recommended minimum dose of allopurinol is 300 mg, or \n200 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] of 30-59 mL/min). If \ntreatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor is interrupted, Zurampic dosing must also be interrupted.\n\nPatients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of renal \nevents (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients should be instructed to stay well hydrated (e.g. 2 litres of liquid per day).\n\nThe target serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg/dL (360 \u00b5mol/L). In patients with tophi or persistent \nsymptoms, the target is less than 5 mg/dL (300 \u00b5mol/L). Testing for the target serum uric acid level \nmay be performed as early as 4 weeks after initiating Zurampic treatment.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nGout flare prophylaxis with colchicine or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is \nrecommended for at least 5 months when starting therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (\u226565 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age (see section 5.2); however, elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function (see dosing recommendations for renal impairment).\nExperience in very elderly (\u226575 years) is limited (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nZurampic must not be initiated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min), \nwith end-stage renal disease or in patients on dialysis (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Based on its \nmechanism of action, lesinurad may not be effective in these patients (see section 5.1). Zurampic \nshould not be initiated in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL of \n30-89 mL/min) (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). Zurampic should be used with caution in patients with a \nCrCL of 30 to less than 45 mL/min (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclasses A and B) (see section 5.2). Zurampic has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment; therefore, dose recommendations cannot be given.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Zurampic in children under 18 years of age have not yet been established.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\nZurampic should be taken in the morning with food and water.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with tumour lysis syndrome or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\n\nSevere renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease, kidney transplant \nrecipients or patients on dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal events\nTreatment with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor was associated with \nan increased incidence of serum creatinine elevations, which are related to increased renal uric acid \nexcretion. Adverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating Zurampic (see section \n4.8). A higher incidence of serum creatinine elevations and renal-related adverse reactions including \nserious adverse reactions was observed with Zurampic 400 mg when given alone or in combination \nwith a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, with the highest incidence when Zurampic was given as \nmonotherapy. Zurampic should not be used as monotherapy or at doses above the recommended dose.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nExperience with Zurampic in patients with an estimated CrCL (eCrCL) less than 45 mL/min is limited;\ntherefore, Zurampic should be used with caution in patients with a CrCL from 30 mL/min to less than \n45 mL/min.\n\nRenal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of Zurampic and monitored periodically \nthereafter, e.g. 4 times per year, based on clinical considerations, such as baseline renal function, \nvolume depletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. Patients with serum creatinine \nelevations to greater than 1.5 times the pre-treatment value should be closely monitored. Zurampic\nshould be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to greater than 2 times the pre-treatment value or \nin case of an absolute serum creatinine value greater than 4.0 mg/dL. Treatment should be interrupted \nin patients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy including flank pain, \nnausea or vomiting, and measure serum creatinine promptly. Zurampic should not be restarted without \nanother explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities.\n\nPre-existing cardiovascular disease\nZurampic is not recommended in patients with unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) \nclass III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or with a recent event of myocardial infarction, \nstroke, or deep venous thrombosis within the last 12 months, due to insufficient data. For \ncardiovascular patients in a stable condition, the benefit/risk balance should be assessed for each \nindividual patient on an ongoing basis, taking into account the benefits of lowering urate levels versus \na potential increase in cardiac risk (see section 4.8).\n\nAcute gouty attacks (gout flares)\nGout flares may occur after initiation of therapy with Zurampic. This is due to reduction in serum uric \nacid levels resulting in mobilisation of urate from tissue deposits. Gout flare prophylaxis with \ncolchicine or an NSAID is recommended for at least 5 months when starting Zurampic therapy (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nZurampic does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. The gout flare should be managed \nconcurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with Zurampic decreases \nthe frequency of gout flares.\n\nEffect of CYP2C9 genotype\nPatients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution, as the potential risk \nof renal-related adverse effects may be increased (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\nClinically relevant interactions with other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A substrates\nLesinurad is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A (see section 4.5). An induction effect of lesinurad \nshould be anticipated after 2 to 3 weeks of continuous co-administration of Zurampic. Additional \nmonitoring of lipids and blood pressure is recommended in patients using sensitive CYP3A substrate \nlipid lowering medicines (such as lovastatin or simvastatin) or antihypertensive medicines (such as \namlodipine, felodipine or nisoldipine), since their efficacy may be reduced (see section 4.5).\n\nHormonal contraceptives \nHormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, may not be \nreliable when Zurampic is co-administered. Female patients of childbearing age should practice \nadditional methods of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking \nZurampic (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\nVery elderly (\u226575 years)\n\nTherapeutic experience in patients 75 years and older is limited. Caution should be used when treating \nthese patients with Zurampic.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nSecondary hyperuricaemia\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricaemia (including organ transplant\nrecipients).\n\nLactose intolerance\nZurampic contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nSalicylates\nSalicylates at doses higher than 325 mg per day may decrease the serum uric acid lowering activity of \nlesinurad and should not be co-administered with Zurampic. Consistent serum uric acid lowering was \nobserved in patients who were receiving low dose acetylsalicylic acid in the placebo-controlled clinical \nstudies in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat. There are no restrictions for doses of salicylates \nof 325 mg or less per day (i.e. for cardiovascular protection).\n\nThiazide diuretics\nConsistent serum uric acid lowering was observed in patients who were receiving thiazide diuretics in \nthe placebo-controlled clinical studies in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffect of lesinurad on other medicinal products\n\nCYP3A substrates\nMild to moderate induction of CYP3A by lesinurad may reduce plasma exposures of co-administered \nmedicines that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A. In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects \nwith Zurampic and CYP3A substrates, lesinurad reduced the plasma concentrations of sildenafil and \namlodipine. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are sensitive CYP3A substrates may interact with \nlesinurad. In the pivotal clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients using lipid lowering or anti-\nhypertensive medicines that were CYP3A substrates required concomitant medicinal product change \nwhen treated with Zurampic 200 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, compared with \npatients treated with placebo in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (35% versus 28%, \nrespectively). The possibility of reduced efficacy of concomitant medicinal products that are CYP3A \nsubstrates should be considered and their efficacy (e.g. blood pressure and cholesterol levels) should \nbe monitored (see section 4.4). \n\nWarfarin\nIn an interaction study conducted in healthy subjects with multiple doses of Zurampic 400 mg and \nsingle dose warfarin (25 mg), lesinurad led to a decrease in exposure of R-warfarin (the less active \nenantiomer) and had no effect on the exposure of S-warfarin (the more active enantiomer). \nAdditionally, lesinurad led to a 6-8% decrease in International Normalised Ratio (INR) and \nProthrombin Time (PT). The standard INR monitoring schedule should be applied, and no further \nactions are required.\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nLesinurad is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A and therefore may lower plasma concentrations of \nsome hormonal contraceptives, thereby decreasing contraceptive effectiveness (see sections 4.4 and \n4.6).\n\nCYP2B6 substrates\nBased on in vitro data, lesinurad may be a mild inducer of CYP2B6 but this interaction has not been\nstudied clinically. Therefore, it is recommended that patients are monitored for reduced efficacy of \nCYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) when co-administered with Zurampic.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nBased on interaction studies in healthy subjects or gout patients, Zurampic does not have clinically \nsignificant interactions with NSAIDs (naproxen and indomethacin), colchicine, repaglinide,\ntolbutamide, febuxostat or allopurinol. Zurampic slightly decreased exposure of oxypurinol (a URAT1 \nsubstrate), the major metabolite of allopurinol; however, the uric acid-lowering effect of the \ncombination with allopurinol was significantly greater than for either substance alone.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on lesinurad\n\nCYP2C9 inhibitors and inducers\nLesinurad exposure is increased when it is co-administered with inhibitors of CYP2C9. Fluconazole, a \nmoderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, increased lesinurad AUC (56%) and Cmax (38%), as well as the amount of \nlesinurad excreted unchanged in urine. Other moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors, such as amiodarone, would \nalso be expected to affect lesinurad pharmacokinetics to a similar degree. Therefore, it is \nrecommended that Zurampic should be used with caution in patients taking moderate inhibitors of \nCYP2C9. Lesinurad exposure is expected to decrease when it is co-administered with inducers of \nCYP2C9 (e.g. carbamazepine, a moderate CYP2C9 inducer). Monitor for decreased efficacy when \nZurampic is co-administered with a CYP2C9 inducer.\n\nRifampin\nRifampin, an inhibitor of OATPs and an inducer of CYP2C9, decreased lesinurad exposure and \nslightly reduced the amount of lesinurad excreted unchanged in urine with no clinically relevant effect. \nThe lack of an observed interaction could be due to the combination of the induction of CYP2C9 and \ninhibition of OATP1B1 and 1B3.\n\nEpoxide hydrolase inhibitors\nInhibitors of microsomal Epoxide Hydrolase (mEH) (e.g. valproic acid, valpromide) may interfere \nwith the metabolism of lesinurad. Zurampic should not be administered with inhibitors of mEH.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of lesinurad in pregnant women. \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Zurampic during pregnancy. Female \npatients of childbearing potential should not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking \nZurampic (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nBreast-feeding\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of lesinurad in milk. A \nrisk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Zurampic should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of lesinurad on fertility in humans has not been studied. In rats, there was no effect on \nmating or fertility with lesinurad (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLesinurad has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of Zurampic 200 mg was evaluated in the Phase 3 combination therapy clinical trials \n(including extension studies). The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with \nZurampic 200 mg are influenza, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, headache and blood creatinine \nincreased. The serious adverse reactions renal failure, renal impairment and nephrolithiasis have \noccurred uncommonly (less than 1 case per 100 patients) (see Table 1). In clinical trials, most adverse \nreactions were mild or moderate in intensity and resolved while continuing Zurampic therapy. The \nmost common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of Zurampic was blood creatinine increased \n(0.8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency categories \nare defined according to the following conventions: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified in clinical studies with patients receiving Zurampic 200 mg \nonce daily in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol or febuxostat.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions by System Organ Class and frequency\n\nSystem Organ Classification Common Uncommon Rare\n\nInfections and infestations Influenza\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity*\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders\n\nDehydration\n\nNervous system disorders Headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Gastro-oesophageal\n\nreflux disease\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Renal failure**\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNephrolithiasis\n\nInvestigations Blood creatinine \n\nincreased\n\n*Photodermatosis, photosensitivity reaction, dermatitis allergic, pruritus and urticaria.\n**Includes the preferred terms: renal failure, renal failure chronic and renal failure acute. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRenal events\nZurampic causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, which may lead to transient increases in \nserum creatinine, renal-related adverse reactions and kidney stones. Although other doses have been \nstudied, the recommended dose of Zurampic is 200 mg once daily in combination with a xanthine \noxidase inhibitor.\n\nIn three 12-month placebo-controlled trials of Zurampic in combination with a xanthine oxidase \ninhibitor versus a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone (placebo), serum creatinine elevations between 1.5-\nfold and 2-fold over baseline occurred in 3.9% of patients on Zurampic 200 mg, 10.0% of patients on \nZurampic 400 mg and 2.3% on placebo; serum creatinine elevations 2-fold or greater over baseline\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\noccurred in 1.8% of patients on Zurampic 200 mg, 6.7% of patients on Zurampic 400 mg and 0% on \nplacebo. These serum creatinine elevations generally resolved, most without treatment interruption. \nRenal-related adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with Zurampic 200 mg (5.7%) and \nZurampic 400 mg (11.8%) compared to placebo (4.5%), resulting in discontinuation of treatment in \n1.2%, 3.3% and 1%, respectively (see section 4.4). The most frequent renal-related adverse reaction \nwas blood creatinine increased (4.3% with Zurampic 200 mg and 7.8% with Zurampic 400 mg \ncompared to 2.3% with placebo). In patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal-\nrelated adverse reactions was similar across all treatment groups: Zurampic 200 mg (12.7%), Zurampic\n400 mg (16.3%) and placebo (13.3%). Serious renal-related adverse reactions, e.g. acute renal failure \nand renal impairment, were reported in patients treated with lesinurad 400 mg (1%) and placebo \n(0.4%) and in no patients on lesinurad 200 mg. Including the combination long-term extension studies, \nthe incidences of serious renal-related adverse reactions (including acute renal failure) per 100 patient-\nyears of exposure were 0.4 and 1.4 for Zurampic 200 mg and Zurampic 400 mg in combination with a \nxanthine oxidase inhibitor, respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Data from the long-term extension \nstudies until 24 months revealed a renal safety profile consistent with that observed in the placebo-\ncontrolled studies.\n\nIn a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy study of Zurampic, renal-related adverse \nreactions and serious renal-related adverse reactions (including acute renal failure) were reported in \n17.8% and 4.7% of patients respectively, receiving Zurampic 400 mg alone and in no patients \nreceiving placebo (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Among serious renal-related adverse reactions: renal \nfailure, renal failure acute and renal impairment were reported in 1.9%, 1.9% and 0.9% respectively, of \npatients receiving lesinurad 400 mg monotherapy and in no patients receiving placebo. Since the \nincidence of severe renal-related adverse events was increased with the monotherapy as compared to \nthe combination therapy with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, Zurampic should not be used as \nmonotherapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nPatients with a history of kidney stones were permitted entry into the 12-month studies of Zurampic in \ncombination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. In these studies, kidney stone adverse reactions \n(nephrolithiasis being the most frequent) were reported in patients treated with Zurampic 200 mg \n(0.6%), Zurampic 400 mg (2.5%) and placebo (1.7%).\n\nCardiovascular safety\nIn the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled combination therapy clinical studies, the \nincidences of patients with adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (CV death, non-fatal \nmyocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) per 100 patient-years of exposure were: 0.71 (95% CI 0.23, \n2.21) for placebo, 0.96 (95% CI 0.36, 2.57) for Zurampic 200 mg, and 1.94 (95% CI 0.97, 3.87) for \nZurampic 400 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. A causal relationship \nwith Zurampic has not been established. All patients with a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event \ntreated with Zurampic 200 mg had a history of heart failure, stroke or myocardial infarction. Post-hoc \nanalyses in a subgroup of patients with high cardiovascular risk at baseline (as defined by transient \nischemic attack, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease \nand/or stroke), showed that the incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events was 1/52 for \nplacebo and 4/53 for Zurampic 200 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.\n\nHypersensitivity\nRare cases of hypersensitivity (photodermatosis, photosensitivity reaction, dermatitis allergic, pruritus \nand urticaria) have been reported with lesinurad during the clinical programme. None of these were \nserious or required hospitalisation.\n\nOther special populations\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nNo overall differences in safety of Zurampic were observed in patients with mild or moderate renal \nimpairment (eCrCL of 30-89 mL/min) compared to patients with normal renal function (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no specific treatment in the event of an overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not \nestablished. In case of overdose, patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care \nincluding adequate hydration.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antigout preparations, preparations increasing uric acid excretion\nATC code: M04AB05\n\nMechanism of action\nLesinurad is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor that inhibits uric acid transporter URAT1. \nURAT1 is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular \nlumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers serum uric \nacid (sUA). Lesinurad also inhibits OAT4, a uric acid transporter involved in diuretic-induced \nhyperuricaemia.\n\nLesinurad, when combined with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, increases uric acid excretion and \ndecreases uric acid production resulting in greater sUA lowering. Lesinurad should only be used in \ncombination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor because combination use reduces the amount of uric \nacid available for excretion and decreases the risk of renal-related events.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nEffects on serum uric acid and urinary excretion of uric acid\nIn healthy subjects, lesinurad 200 mg lowered sUA levels and increased renal clearance and fractional \nexcretion of uric acid. Mean sUA reductions following Zurampic 200 mg administration alone were \napproximately 46% and 26% at 6 hours and 24 hours post-dose, respectively. When Zurampic 200 mg \nwas added to a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (i.e. febuxostat), additional 25% and 19% of sUA reductions \nwere observed at 6 hours and 24 hours post-dose, respectively.\n\nEffect on cardiac repolarisation\nLesinurad at doses up to 1,600 mg did not demonstrate an effect on ECG parameters (including QTc \ninterval) in healthy subjects.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy of Zurampic 200 mg and 400 mg once daily was studied in 3 multicentre, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in 1,537 adult patients (13% of these patients were \nelderly, \u226565 years old) with hyperuricaemia and gout in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, \nallopurinol (CLEAR1 and CLEAR2) or febuxostat (CRYSTAL). All studies were of 12 months \nduration and patients received prophylaxis for gout flares with colchicine or NSAIDs during the first 5 \nmonths of lesinurad treatment.\n\nBased on these studies, Zurampic is only recommended at a dose of 200 mg once daily in combination \nwith a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10\n\nZurampic as add-on to allopurinol in inadequate responders\nCLEAR1 and CLEAR2 enrolled patients with gout who were on a stable dose of allopurinol of at least \n300 mg (or 200 mg for moderate renal impairment), had serum uric acid levels greater than 6.5 mg/dL \nand reported at least 2 gout flares in the previous 12 months. Across both studies, 61% of patients had \nmild or moderate renal impairment and 19% had tophi at baseline. Patients continued their allopurinol \ndose and were randomised 1:1:1 to receive Zurampic 200 mg, Zurampic 400 mg, or placebo once \ndaily.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both CLEAR1 and CLEAR2 was the proportion of patients \nachieving a serum uric acid target level of less than 6 mg/dL by Month 6. In both studies, significantly \nmore patients treated with Zurampic 200 mg in combination with allopurinol achieved the target serum \nuric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL by Month 6 and by Month 12 compared with patients receiving \nplacebo in combination with allopurinol (see Table 2).\n\nThe stability of the sustained response was demonstrated with a greater proportion of patients treated \nwith Zurampic 200 mg in combination with allopurinol achieving the target serum uric acid level at \neach visit for 3 consecutive months (Months 4, 5 and 6) compared to patients treated with placebo in \ncombination with allopurinol (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Proportion of patients who achieved target serum uric acid levels (<6 mg/dL) with \nZurampic in combination with allopurinol - Pooled data from CLEAR1 and CLEAR2 \nstudies\n\nProportion of patients who met serum uric acid target \n(<6.0 mg/dL)\n\nN (%)\n\nDifference in proportion\n(95% C.I.)\n\nTimepoint Placebo + allopurinol\n\nN=407\n\nZurampic 200 mg + \nallopurinol\n\nN=405\n\nZurampic 200 mg vs.\nplacebo\n\nMonths 4, 5, 6 48 (12%) 155 (38%)\n0.26\n\n(0.21, 0.32)\n\nMonth 6 104 (26%) 222 (55%)\n0.29\n\n(0.23, 0.36)\n\nMonth 12 105 (26%) 203 (50%)\n0.24\n\n(0.18, 0.31)\n\nZurampic when added to allopurinol caused an immediate reduction of the mean serum uric acid \nlevels, as compared to placebo, which was sustained in the long term in those patients who continued \ntreatment (see Figure 1).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nFigure 1 Mean serum uric acid levels in pooled clinical studies with Zurampic in combination \nwith allopurinol in patients with inadequate response (sUA \u22656 mg/dL) to allopurinol \nalone\n\nIn each of the studies, a greater proportion of patients treated with Zurampic 200 mg in combination \nwith allopurinol compared with placebo in combination with allopurinol achieved a serum uric acid \nless than 5 mg/dL by Month 6 (CLEAR1: 29% versus 10%; CLEAR2: 35% versus 5%).\n\nZurampic in combination with febuxostat in tophaceous gout\nCRYSTAL enrolled gout patients with measurable tophi. Patients received febuxostat 80 mg once \ndaily for 3 weeks and then were randomised 1:1:1 to once daily doses of Zurampic 200 mg, Zurampic \n400 mg, or placebo in combination with febuxostat. Sixty-six percent of patients had mild or moderate \nrenal impairment. Fifty percent of patients had a baseline sUA \u22655.0 mg/dL, which was after 3 weeks \nof treatment with febuxostat alone.\n\nZurampic when added to febuxostat caused an immediate reduction of the mean serum uric acid levels, \nas compared to placebo, which was sustained in the long term in those patients who continued \ntreatment.\n\nIn the subgroup of patients with a baseline sUA \u22655.0 mg/dL, after 3 weeks of febuxostat therapy, a \nsignificant difference was achieved at all study visits for Zurampic 200 mg in combination with \nfebuxostat compared with placebo in combination with febuxostat (see Table 3).\n\nBaseline\n\nTime from Baseline in Months\n\nM\nea\n\nn\n (\n\nS\nE\n\n) \nS\n\ner\nu\n\nm\n U\n\nri\nc \n\nA\nci\n\nd\n (\n\nm\ng/\n\nd\nL\n\n)\n\nTreatment Group: --o-- Placebo + Allopurinol, \uf02d\uf044\uf02d Zurampic 200 mg + Allopurinol\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12\n\nTable 3 Proportion of patients with baseline sUA \u22655.0 mg/dLwho achieve target serum uric \nacid levels (<5 mg/dL) with Zurampic in combination with febuxostat\n\nProportion of patients who met serum uric acid \nTarget (<5.0 mg/dL)\n\nN(%)\n\nDifference in proportion\n(95% C.I.)\n\nTimepoint Placebo + febuxostat \n80 mg\nN=51\n\nZurampic 200 mg + \nfebuxostat 80 mg\n\nN=59\n\nZurampic 200 mg vs.\nplacebo\n\nMonths 4, 5, 6 6 (12%) 23 (39%) 0.27\n(0.12, 0.42)\n\nMonth 6 12 (24%) 26 (44%) 0.21\n(0.03, 0.38)\n\nMonth 12 12 (24%) 27 (46%) 0.22\n(0.05, 0.39)\n\nPrimary end-point in patients with renal impairment\nConsistent with the overall population, the proportion of patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (eCrCL 30-89 mL/min) who achieved target serum uric acid levels at Month 6 was 56% \nfor Zurampic 200 mg versus 29% for placebo when added to allopurinol, and 40% for Zurampic \n200 mg versus 26% for placebo when added to febuxostat in patients with baseline sUA \u22655.0 mg/dL.\n\nClinical outcomes - gout flares requiring treatment\nThe rates of gout flare requiring treatment were low and comparable to placebo in the last 6 months of \nthe randomised trials (after gout flare prophylaxis was discontinued) with median scores of zero. In \nthe long-term uncontrolled extension trials, the rates of gout flares requiring treatment further\ndecreased in the 60% of subjects who entered the extension studies and continued treatment with \nZurampic 200 mg in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat for up to an additional year of \ntreatment.\n\nClinical outcomes - tophus resolution and reduction\nIn CRYSTAL, the proportion of subjects who experienced a complete resolution (defined as 100% \nresolution of at least one target tophus and no single tophus showing progression) of \u22651 target tophus \nwas higher in the group treated with Zurampic 200 mg in combination with febuxostat compared with \nplacebo in combination with febuxostat, although the difference was not statistically different (26% \ncompared with 21%). After continued treatment of up to 24 months on Zurampic 200 mg in \ncombination with febuxostat, the proportion of subjects who experienced complete resolution of at \nleast one target tophus increased to 53% of subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZurampic in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricaemia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nThe absolute bioavailability of lesinurad is approximately 100%. Lesinurad is rapidly absorbed after \noral administration. Following administration of a single oral dose of lesinurad in either the fed or \nfasted state, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were attained within 1 to 4 hours. Cmax and AUC \nexposures of lesinurad increased proportionally with single doses of lesinurad from 5 to 1,200 mg. In \nthe fed state, after a single dose of lesinurad 200 mg, geometric mean lesinurad Cmax and AUC were \n6 \u03bcg/mL and 29 \u03bcg/hr/mL, respectively. There was no apparent influence of the fat content in the meal \non the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. In clinical trials, Zurampic was administered with food, because \nthe serum uric acid lowering was improved under fed conditions.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nZurampic is administered as a 50:50 mixture of lesinurad atropisomers. The ratio of atropisomer 1 to \natropisomer 2 AUC(0-24) was 44:56 because atropisomer 1 undergoes more extensive metabolism \nthan atropisomer 2, causing atropisomer 1 to have lower plasma exposure than atropisomer 2.\n\nDistribution\nLesinurad is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (greater than 98%), mainly to albumin. Plasma \nprotein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The mean \nsteady state volume of distribution of lesinurad was approximately 20 L following intravenous dosing.\nMean plasma-to-blood ratios of lesinurad AUC and Cmax were approximately 1.8, indicating that \nradioactivity was largely contained in the plasma space and did not penetrate or partition extensively \ninto red blood cells.\n\nBiotransformation\nLesinurad undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 to intermediate \nmetabolite M3c (not detected in vivo) and is subsequently metabolised by mEH to metabolite M4; \nthere is minimal contribution from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A to the metabolism of lesinurad.\nAtropisomer 1 is extensively metabolised by CYP2C9 whereas atropisomer 2 is minimally\nmetabolised by both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. It is unclear if metabolite plasma exposures are minimal. \nMetabolites are not known to contribute to the uric acid lowering effects of lesinurad.\n\nElimination\nRenal clearance is 25.6 mL/min (CV=56%). Lesinurad is highly protein bound and renal clearance is \nhigh (as compared to typical human glomerular filtration rate), indicating that active secretion plays an \nimportant role in the renal excretion of lesinurad. Within 7 days following single dosing of \nradiolabelled lesinurad, 63% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 32% of \nadministered radioactive dose was recovered in faeces. Most of the radioactivity recovered in urine \n(>60% of dose) occurred in the first 24 hours. Unchanged lesinurad in urine accounted for \napproximately 30% of the dose. The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) of lesinurad was approximately 5 hours \nfollowing a single dose. Lesinurad does not accumulate following multiple doses.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nFollowing multiple once daily dosing of Zurampic, there was no evidence of time dependent changes \nin pharmacokinetic properties and dose proportionality was preserved.\n\nIn vitro assessment of interactions\nLesinurad is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and mEH, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19 \nand CYP3A. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and mEH. In addition, lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and \nCYP3A via CAR/PXR. In vivo, lesinurad is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP2C9 and 2C8, \nbut a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. CYP2B6 has not been studied in vivo.\n\nLesinurad is a substrate of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of \nOATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, OAT4 and OCT1 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. However, \nthe in vivo activity of OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT1 was not affected by lesinurad. Lesinurad is \nnot an in vitro inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B3, MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, MATE1 and \nMATE2-K.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical data in gout patients treated for up to 12 months \nestimated increases in lesinurad exposure of approximately 12%, 31% and 65% in patients with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal \nfunction.\n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of lesinurad to individuals with renal impairment compared \nto those with normal renal function lesinurad Cmax and AUC, respectively, were 36% and 30% higher \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\n(200 mg) in patients with mild renal impairment (eCrCL 60 to 89 mL/min), 20% and 73% higher \n(200 mg) and 3% and 50% higher (400 mg) in patients with moderate renal impairment (eCrCL 30 to \n59 mL/min), and 13% higher and 113% higher (400 mg) in patients with severe renal impairment \n(eCrCL <30 mL/min).\n\nHepatic impairment\nFollowing administration of a single dose of lesinurad at 400 mg in patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nclass A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, lesinurad Cmax was comparable and \nlesinurad AUC was 7% and 33% higher, respectively, compared to individuals with normal hepatic \nfunction. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nCYP2C9 poor metabolisers\nApproximately half of an oral dose of lesinurad is cleared via CYP2C9 metabolism. The effect of \nCYP2C9 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad was studied in 8 healthy subjects and 59 \npatients with gout following daily dosing of lesinurad ranging from 200 mg to 600 mg in the absence \nor presence of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. At the 400 mg dose, when compared with extensive \nCYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*1 [N=41]), increased lesinurad exposures were observed in \nintermediate CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*3 [N=4], approximately 22% increase in AUC) and \nin poor CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *3/*3 [N=1], approximately 111% increase in AUC) \naccompanied with higher lesinurad renal excretion. However, individual values were well within the \nrange observed in the extensive metaboliser subjects.\n\nPatients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers based on previous history or \nexperience with other CYP2C9 substrates should use Zurampic with caution (see section 4.4).\n\nOther special populations\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, gender, race and ethnicity do not have a clinically \nmeaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling \nsimulations, patients with moderate renal impairment and reduced CYP2C9 activity (co-administration \nof a CYP2C9 inhibitor or a CYP2C9 poor metabolizer) are predicted to have an increase in AUC of \napproximately 200% in comparison to normal renal function and unimpaired CYP2C9 activity.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Zurampic is and what it is used for\n\nZurampic contains the active ingredient lesinurad and is used to treat gout in adult patients by lowering \nthe levels of uric acid in the blood. Zurampic must be taken together with allopurinol or febuxostat, \nwhich are medicines called \u2018xanthine oxidase inhibitors\u2019 and are also used to treat gout by lowering \nthe amount of uric acid in your blood.\n\nYour doctor will prescribe Zurampic if your current medicine is not controlling your gout. You must \nuse Zurampic together with either allopurinol or febuxostat.\n\nHow Zurampic works:\nGout is a type of arthritis caused by an accumulation of urate crystals around the joints. By lowering \nthe amount of uric acid in the blood, Zurampic stops this accumulation and may prevent further joint \ndamage.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Zurampic\n\nDo not take Zurampic:\n- if you are allergic to lesinurad or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6)\n- if you have \u2018tumour lysis syndrome\u2019 \u2013 a fast breakdown of cancer cells which can cause high \n\nuric acid levels\n- if you have \u2018Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\u2019 \u2013 a rare inherited illness that starts in childhood where \n\nthere is too much uric acid in the blood\n- if your kidneys work very poorly or you have \u2018End-Stage Kidney Disease\u2019\n- if you have received a kidney transplant\n- if you are on kidney dialysis.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25\n\nDo not take Zurampic if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or\npharmacist before taking Zurampic.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zurampic.\n\nLook out for side effects\nZurampic may cause serious kidney problems (see section 4), which occur more frequently if \nZurampic is taken alone (see section 3). Your doctor may ask you to have tests to check how your \nkidneys are working.\n\nTell your doctor before taking Zurampic if you have or have had heart failure or other heart problems.\n\nIf your gout gets worse\nSome people may have more gout attacks (gout flares) when they start using Zurampic and during the \nfirst weeks or months of treatment. If this happens, keep taking Zurampic and talk to your doctor or \npharmacist. The medicine is still working to lower uric acid.

These are to help prevent or treat the symptoms of gout attacks (a sudden or severe \npain and swelling in a joint). Your doctor will tell you how long to take these other medicines for.\n\nTests and checks\nYour doctor will check how well your kidneys are working before starting and during treatment with \nZurampic.

Your doctor may tell you to restart treatment with Zurampic when your kidney function \nimproves.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZurampic is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Zurampic\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Zurampic can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other \nmedicines can affect the way Zurampic works.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines as they \nmay interact with Zurampic and your doctor will need to know:\n\n- acetylsalicylic acid \u2013 to relieve fever and pain - at doses above 325 mg per day\n- medicines to treat high blood pressure, e.g. amlodipine\n- medicines to treat high cholesterol levels, e.g. simvastatin\n- fluconazole \u2013 to treat fungal infections\n- amiodarone \u2013 to treat heart rhythm problems\n- valproic acid, valpromide or carbamazepine \u2013 to treat fits (seizures), mood disorders and prevent \n\nmigraines\n- sildenafil \u2013 to treat erectile dysfunction\n- contraceptives \u2013 used to prevent pregnancy, including oral contraception (such as \u2018the pill\u2019), \n\ninjections, patches and implants\n- rifampin \u2013 to treat tuberculosis\n- warfarin \u2013 to prevent and treat blood clots forming in the legs, lungs, brain and heart.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nZurampic.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nYou should avoid taking Zurampic during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZurampic is not expected to affect you being able to drive a car or use any tools or machines.\n\nZurampic contains lactose\nZurampic tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nan intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.\n\n3. How to take Zurampic\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nZurampic must always be taken together with your morning dose of either allopurinol or \nfebuxostat.

Do not take more than one (1) \ntablet of Zurampic per day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n- take in the morning with food and water\n- take Zurampic at the same time as your morning dose of \u2018xanthine oxidase inhibitor\u2019 medicine \u2013\n\nallopurinol or febuxostat. If you take Zurampic on its own you may be more likely to get kidney \nproblems\n\n- drink plenty of water during the day. Two litres is a good amount to drink.\n\nIf you stop taking your xanthine oxidase inhibitor medicine, you must also stop taking \nZurampic. Zurampic must never be taken without a \u2018xanthine oxidase inhibitor\u2019 medicine. Failure to \nfollow these instructions may increase the risk of kidney side effects.\n\nIf you take more Zurampic than you should\nIf you take more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor or go to the nearest hospital.\n\nIf you forget to take Zurampic\nIf you miss a dose of Zurampic, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Wait and \ntake your next dose of Zurampic with your next morning dose of allopurinol or febuxostat. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about how to take your next dose. \n\nIf you stop taking Zurampic\nDo not stop taking Zurampic without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.
