This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nLeqvio 284 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains inclisiran sodium equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran in 1.5 ml solution. \n\n \n\nEach ml contains inclisiran sodium equivalent to 189 mg inclisiran. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection (injection). \n\n \n\nThe solution is clear, colourless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particulates. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nLeqvio is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and \n\nnon-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: \n\n in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to \n\nreach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or \n\n alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, \n\nor for whom a statin is contraindicated. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 284 mg inclisiran administered as a single subcutaneous injection: initially, \n\nagain at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a planned dose is missed by less than 3 months, inclisiran should be administered and dosing \n\ncontinued according to the patient’s original schedule. \n\n \n\nIf a planned dose is missed by more than 3 months, a new dosing schedule should be started – \n\ninclisiran should be administered initially, again at 3 months, followed by every 6 months. \n\n \n\nTreatment transition from monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitors \n\nInclisiran can be administered immediately after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 \n\ninhibitor. To maintain LDL-C lowering it is recommended that inclisiran is administered within \n\n2 weeks after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (age ≥65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate \n\n(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see section 5.2). Inclisiran should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment. \n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or \n\npatients with end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2). There is limited experience with inclisiran in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment. Inclisiran should be used with caution in these patients. See \n\nsection 4.4 for precautions to take in case of haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of inclisiran in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous use. \n\n \n\nInclisiran is for subcutaneous injection into the abdomen; alternative injection sites include the upper \n\narm or thigh. Injections should not be given into areas of active skin disease or injury such as \n\nsunburns, skin rashes, inflammation or skin infections. \n\n \n\nEach 284 mg dose is administered using a single pre-filled syringe. Each pre-filled syringe is for \n\nsingle use only. \n\n \n\nInclisiran is intended for administration by a healthcare professional. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\n \n\nThe effect of haemodialysis on inclisiran pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Considering that \n\ninclisiran is eliminated renally, haemodialysis should not be performed for at least 72 hours after \n\ninclisiran dosing. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\n“sodium-free”. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInclisiran is not a substrate for common drug transporters and, although in vitro studies were not \n\nconducted, it is not anticipated to be a substrate for cytochrome P450. Inclisiran is not an inhibitor or \n\ninducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes or common drug transporters. Therefore, inclisiran is not \n\nexpected to have clinically significant interactions with other medicinal products. Based on the limited \n\ndata available, clinically meaningful interactions with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or other statins are not \n\nexpected. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of inclisiran in pregnant women. Animal studies \n\ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of inclisiran during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether inclisiran is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological \n\ndata in animals have shown excretion of inclisiran in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants \n\ncannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\ninclisiran therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo data on the effect of inclisiran on human fertility are available. Animal studies did not show any \n\neffects on fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nLeqvio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe only adverse reactions associated with inclisiran were adverse reactions at the injection site \n\n(8.2%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are presented by system organ class (Table 1). Frequency categories are defined as: \n\nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with inclisiran \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency category \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nAdverse reactions at the \n\ninjection site1 \n\nCommon \n\n1 See section “Description of selected adverse reactions” \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions at the injection site \n\nAdverse reactions at the injection site occurred in 8.2% and 1.8% of inclisiran and placebo patients, \n\nrespectively, in the pivotal studies. The proportion of patients in each group who discontinued \n\ntreatment due to adverse reactions at the injection site was 0.2% and 0.0%, respectively. All of these \n\nadverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity, transient and resolved without sequelae. The most \n\nfrequently occurring adverse reactions at the injection site in patients treated with inclisiran were \n\ninjection site reaction (3.1%), injection site pain (2.2%), injection site erythema (1.6%), and injection \n\nsite rash (0.7%). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nOf the 1,833 patients treated with inclisiran in the pivotal studies, 981 (54%) were 65 years of age or \n\nolder, while 239 (13%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety were observed \n\nbetween these patients and younger patients. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal studies 1,830 patients were tested for anti-drug antibodies. Confirmed positivity was \n\ndetected in 1.8% (33/1,830) of patients prior to dosing and in 4.9% (90/1,830) of patients during the \n\n18 months of treatment with inclisiran. No clinically significant differences in the clinical efficacy, \n\nsafety or pharmacodynamic profiles of inclisiran were observed in the patients who tested positive for \n\nanti-inclisiran antibodies. \n\n \n\nLaboratory values \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical studies, there were more frequent elevations of serum hepatic transaminases \n\nbetween >1x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and ≤3x ULN in patients on inclisiran (ALT: 19.7% and \n\nAST: 17.2%) than in patients on placebo (ALT: 13.6% and AST: 11.1%). These elevations did not \n\nprogress to exceed the clinically relevant threshold of 3x ULN, were asymptomatic and were not \n\nassociated with adverse reactions or other evidence of liver dysfunction. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo clinically relevant adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received inclisiran at \n\ndoses up to three times the therapeutic dose. No specific treatment for inclisiran overdose is available. \n\nIn the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures \n\ninstituted as required. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: \n\nC10AX16 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nInclisiran is a cholesterol-lowering, double-stranded, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), \n\nconjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake \n\nby hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran utilises the RNA interference mechanism and directs \n\ncatalytic breakdown of mRNA for proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9. This increases LDL-C \n\nreceptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which increases LDL-C uptake and \n\nlowers LDL-C levels in the circulation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nFollowing a single subcutaneous administration of 284 mg inclisiran, LDL-C reduction was apparent \n\nwithin 14 days post-dose. Mean reductions of 48-51% for LDL-C were observed 30 to 60 days \n\npost-dose. At day 180, LDL-C levels were still reduced by approximately 53%. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and some publications, the 284 mg inclisiran dose is equivalent and referred to as \n\n300 mg inclisiran sodium salt. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of inclisiran was evaluated in three phase III studies in patients with atherosclerotic \n\ncardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral artery \n\ndisease), ASCVD risk equivalents (type 2 diabetes mellitus, familial hypercholesterolaemia, or \n\n10-year risk of 20% or greater of having a cardiovascular event assessed by Framingham Risk Score \n\nor equivalent) and/or familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Patients were taking a maximally tolerated \n\ndose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy and required additional LDL-C reduction \n\n(patients unable to reach their treatment goals). Approximately 17% of patients were statin intolerant. \n\nPatients were administered subcutaneous injections of 284 mg inclisiran or placebo on day 1, day 90, \n\nday 270 and day 450. Patients were followed until day 540. \n\n \n\nThe effect of inclisiran on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined. \n\n \n\nIn the phase III pooled analysis, subcutaneously administered inclisiran lowered LDL-C between 50% \n\nand 55% as early as day 90 (Figure 1), which was maintained during long-term therapy. Maximal \n\nLDL-C reduction was achieved at day 150 following a second administration. Small but statistically \n\nsignificant increased LDL-C reductions up to 65% were associated with lower baseline LDL-C levels \n\n(approximately <2 mmol/l [77 mg/dl]), higher baseline PCSK9 levels and higher statin doses and \n\nstatin intensity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nFigure 1 Mean percentage change from baseline LDL-C in patients with primary \n\nhypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia treated with inclisiran compared to \n\nplacebo (pooled analysis) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents \n\nTwo studies were conducted in patients with ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION-10 and \n\nORION-11). Patients were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statins with or without other \n\nlipid-modifying therapy, such as ezetimibe, and required additional LDL-C reduction. As lowering \n\nLDL-C is expected to improve cardiovascular outcomes, the co-primary endpoints in each study were \n\nthe percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 relative to placebo and the time-adjusted \n\npercentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 to estimate the integrated \n\neffect on LDL-C over time. \n\n \n\nORION-10 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 18-month study \n\nconducted in 1,561 patients with ASCVD. \n\n \n\nThe mean age at baseline was 66 years (range: 35 to 90 years), 60% were ≥65 years old, 31% were \n\nwomen, 86% were White, 13% were Black, 1% were Asian and 14% were Hispanic or Latino \n\nethnicity. The mean baseline LDL C was 2.7 mmol/l (105 mg/dl). Sixty-nine percent (69%) were \n\ntaking high-intensity statins, 19% were taking medium-intensity statins, 1% were taking low-intensity \n\nstatins and 11% were not on a statin. The most commonly administered statins were atorvastatin and \n\nrosuvastatin. \n\n \n\nInclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 \n\ncompared to placebo by 52% (95% CI: -56%, -49%; p <0.0001) (Table 2). \n\n \n\nInclisiran also significantly reduced the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after \n\nday 90 and up to day 540 by 54% compared to placebo (95% CI: -56%, -51%; p <0.0001).

More than 75% of \n\npatients were receiving a high-intensity statin background treatment, 87% of patients had ASCVD and \n\n13% were ASCVD risk equivalent. \n\n \n\nThe mean age at baseline was 65 years (range: 20 to 88 years), 55% were ≥65 years old, 28% were \n\nwomen, 98% were White, 1% were Black ,1% were Asian and 1% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \n\nThe mean baseline LDL-C was 2.7 mmol/l (105 mg/dl). Seventy-eight percent (78%) were taking \n\nhigh-intensity statins, 16% were taking medium-intensity statins, 0.4% were taking low-intensity \n\nstatins and 5% were not on a statin. The most commonly administered statins were atorvastatin and \n\nrosuvastatin. \n\n \nInclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 \n\ncompared to placebo by 50% (95% CI: -53%, -47%; p<0.0001) (Table 3). \n\n \n\nInclisiran also significantly reduced time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after \n\nday 90 and up to day 540 by 49% compared to placebo (95% CI: -52%, -48%; p<0.0001).

In patients with an ASCVD risk equivalent, the \n\nLDL-C target of <2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) was achieved by 78% of inclisiran patients compared to \n\n31% of placebo patients. \n\n \n\nConsistent and statistically significant (p<0.05) percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 \n\nand time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 was \n\nobserved across all subgroups irrespective of baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics \n\n(including gender, age, body mass index, race and baseline statin use), comorbidities, and geographic \n\nregions. \n\n \n\nHeterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia \n\nORION-9 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 18-month \n\ntrial in 482 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH). All patients were \n\ntaking maximally tolerated doses of statins with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, such as \n\nezetimibe, and required additional LDL-C reduction. The diagnosis of HeFH was made either by \n\ngenotyping or clinical criteria (“definite FH” using either the Simon Broome or WHO/Dutch Lipid \n\nNetwork criteria). \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 relative to \n\nplacebo, and the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after day 90 and up to \n\nday 540 to estimate the integrated effect on LDL-C over time. Key secondary endpoints were the \n\nabsolute change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510, the time-adjusted absolute change in LDL-C \n\nfrom baseline after day 90 and up to day 540 and the percentage change from baseline to day 510 in \n\nPCSK9, total cholesterol, Apo-B, and non-HDL-C. Additional secondary endpoints included the, \n\nindividual responsiveness to inclisiran and the proportion of patients attaining global lipid targets for \n\ntheir level of ASCVD risk. \n\n \n\nThe mean age at baseline was 55 years (range: 21 to 80 years), 22% were ≥65 years old, 53% were \n\nwomen, 94% were White, 3% were Black, 3% were Asian and 3% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \n\nThe mean baseline LDL-C was 4.0 mmol/l (153 mg/dl). Seventy-four percent (74%) were taking \n\nhigh-intensity statins, 15% were taking medium-intensity statins and 10% were not on a statin. \n\nFifty-two percent (52%) of patients were treated with ezetimibe. The most commonly administered \n\nstatins were atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. \n\n \nInclisiran significantly reduced the mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to day 510 \n\ncompared to placebo by 48% (95% CI: -54%, -42%; p<0.0001) (Table 4). \n\n \n\nInclisiran also significantly reduced the time-adjusted percentage change in LDL-C from baseline after \n\nday 90 and up to day 540 by 44% compared to placebo (95% CI: -48%, -40%; p<0.0001).

At the recommended dosing \n\nregimen of 284 mg plasma concentrations reached peak in approximately 4 hours post dose, with a \n\nmean Cmax of 509 ng/ml. Concentrations reached undetectable levels within 48 hours post dosing. The \n\nmean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing extrapolated to infinity was \n\n7980 ng*h/ml. Pharmacokinetic findings following multiple subcutaneous administrations of inclisiran \n\nwere similar to single-dose administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nInclisiran is 87% protein bound in vitro at the relevant clinical plasma concentrations. Following a \n\nsingle subcutaneous 284 mg dose of inclisiran to healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution is \n\napproximately 500 litres. Based on non-clinical data inclisiran has been shown to have high uptake \n\ninto and selectivity for the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nInclisiran is primarily metabolised by nucleases to shorter inactive nucleotides of varying length. \n\nInclisiran is not a substrate for common drug transporters and, although in vitro studies were not \n\nconducted, it is not anticipated to be a substrate for cytochrome P450. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe terminal elimination half-life of inclisiran is approximately 9 hours and no accumulation occurs \n\nwith multiple dosing. Sixteen percent (16%) of inclisiran is cleared through the kidney. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nIn the phase I clinical study, an approximately dose proportional increase in inclisiran exposure was \n\nobserved after administration of subcutaneous doses of inclisiran ranging from 24 mg to 756 mg. No \n\naccumulation and no time-dependent changes were observed after multiple subcutaneous doses of \n\ninclisiran. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n\n \n\nIn the phase I clinical study, a dissociation was observed between inclisiran pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters and LDL-C pharmacodynamic effects. Selective delivery of inclisiran to hepatocytes, \n\nwhere it is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), results in a long duration of \n\naction, beyond that anticipated based on the plasma elimination half-life of 9 hours. The maximal \n\neffects of reducing LDL-C were observed with a 284 mg dose, with higher doses not producing \n\ngreater effects. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPharmacokinetic analysis of data from a dedicated renal impairment study reported an increase in \n\ninclisiran Cmax of approximately 2.3, 2.0 and 3.3-fold and an increase in inclisiran AUC of \n\napproximately 1.6, 1.8 and 2.3-fold, in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CrCL] of 60 ml/min to \n\n89 ml/min), moderate (CrCL of 30 ml/min to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCL of 15 ml/min to \n\n29 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function. Despite the \n\nhigher transient plasma exposures over 48 hours, the reduction in LDL-C was similar across all groups \n\nof renal function. Based on population pharmacodynamic modelling, no dose adjustment is \n\nrecommended in patients with end-stage renal disease. Based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic \n\nand safety assessments, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe \n\nrenal impairment. The effect of haemodialysis on inclisiran pharmacokinetics has not been studied. \n\nConsidering that inclisiran is eliminated renally, haemodialysis should not be performed for at least \n\n72 hours after Leqvio dosing. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPharmacokinetic analysis of data from a dedicated hepatic impairment study reported an increase in \n\ninclisiran Cmax of approximately 1.1 and 2.1-fold, and an increase in inclisiran AUC of \n\napproximately1.3 and 2.0-fold, respectively, in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) and moderate \n\n(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment relative to patients with normal hepatic function. Despite the \n\nhigher transient inclisiran plasma exposures, the reductions in LDL-C were similar between the groups \n\nof patients administered inclisiran with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment. In \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment baseline PCSK9 levels were markedly lower and the \n\nreduction in LDL-C was less than that observed in patients with normal hepatic function. No dose \n\nadjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and \n\nB). Leqvio has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nOther special populations \n\nA population pharmacodynamic analysis was conducted on data from 4,328 patients. Age, body \n\nweight, gender, race, and creatinine clearance were not found to significantly influence inclisiran \n\npharmacodynamics. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with these demographics. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn repeated dose toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys the no observed adverse effect \n\nlevels (NOAEL) were identified as the highest doses administered subcutaneously which produced \n\nexposures considerably in excess of the maximum human exposure. Microscopic observations from \n\ntoxicology studies included vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of \n\nmonkeys, and the presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats and \n\nmonkeys. These observations were not associated with changes in clinical laboratory parameters and \n\nare not considered adverse. \n\n \n\nInclisiran was not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats or in TgRasH2 mice administered inclisiran at \n\ndoses sufficiently in excess of clinical doses. \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic or clastogenic potential of inclisiran was found in a battery of tests, including  a \n\nbacterial mutagenicity assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood \n\nlymphocytes and an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n\n \n\nReproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus \n\ndue to inclisiran at the highest doses administered, which produced exposure considerably in excess of \n\nthe maximum human exposure. \n\n \n\nInclisiran did not affect the fertility or reproductive performance of male rats and female rats exposed \n\nto inclisiran prior to gestation and during gestation. The doses were associated with systemic \n\nexposures many times greater than the human exposure at clinical doses. \n\n \n\nInclisiran has been observed in the milk of lactating rats; however, there is no evidence of systemic \n\nabsorption in suckling rat neonates. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Leqvio is and what it is used for \n\n2.

What Leqvio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Leqvio is and how it works \n\nLeqvio contains the active substance inclisiran. Inclisiran lowers levels of LDL-cholesterol (“bad” \n\ncholesterol), which can cause heart and blood circulation problems when levels are raised. \n\n \n\nInclisiran works by interfering with RNA (genetic material in body cells) to limit the production of a \n\nprotein called PCSK9. This protein can increase LDL-cholesterol levels and preventing its production \n\nhelps to lower your LDL-cholesterol levels. \n\n \n\nWhat Leqvio is used for \n\nLeqvio is used in addition to your cholesterol-lowering diet if you are an adult with a high cholesterol \n\nlevel in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial and non-familial, \n\nor mixed dyslipidaemia). \n\n \n\nLeqvio is given: \n\n- together with a statin (a type of medicine that treats high cholesterol), sometimes combined with \n\nanother cholesterol-lowering treatment if the maximum dose of the statin does not work well \n\nenough, or \n\n- alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins do not work well or \n\ncannot be used. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

To maintain LDL-C lowering it is recommended that inclisiran is administered within \n\n2 weeks after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (age ≥65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate \n\n(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh class C). Inclisiran should be used with caution in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment. \n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment or \n\npatients with end stage renal disease. There is limited experience wth inclisiran in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment. Inclisiran should be used with caution in these patients. See section 4.4 of the SmPC \n\nfor precautions to take in case of haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of inclisiran in children aged less than 18 years has not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nMethod of administration (see section 4.2 of the SmPC) \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous use. \n\n \n\nInclisiran is for subcutaneous injection into the abdomen; alternative injection sites include the upper \n\narm or thigh. Injections should not be given into areas of active skin disease or injury such as \n\nsunburns, skin rashes, inflammation, or skin infections. \n\n \n\nEach 284 mg dose is administered using a single pre-filled syringe. Each pre-filled syringe is for \n\nsingle use only. \n\n \n\nInclisiran is intended for administration by a healthcare professional. \n\n \n\nContraindications (see section 4.3 of the SmPC) \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\nSpecial warnings and precautions (see section 4.4 of the SmPC) \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\n \n\nThe effect of haemodialysis on inclisiran pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Considering that \n\ninclisiran is eliminated renally, haemodialysis should not be performed for at least 72 hours after \n\ninclisiran dosing. \n\n \n\nStorage (see section 6.4 of the SmPC) \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. Do not freeze. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.
