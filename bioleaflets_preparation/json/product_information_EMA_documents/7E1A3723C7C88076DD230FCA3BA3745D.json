The infusion duration may be extended up to 20 hours to help \nminimise reactions during infusion (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) that do not respond adequately to other \nsupportive measures.  The infusion must be terminated after 20 hours, even if the full dose cannot be \ndelivered within this timeframe. \n \nPre-medication should always be considered before starting each infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity (Grade 4) to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAllergic reactions \nAntihistamine premedication (e.g. hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine) should be administered by intravenous \ninjection approximately 20 minutes before starting each dinutuximab infusion.  It is recommended that \nantihistamine medicinal product be repeated every 4–6 hours as required during infusion of Unituxin.  \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions for 4 hours after the completion \nof the Unituxin infusion. \n \nEpinephrine (adrenaline) and hydrocortisone for intravenous administration should be immediately available \nat the bedside during administration of dinutuximab to manage life-threatening allergic reactions.  It is \nrecommended that treatment for such reactions include hydrocortisone administered by intravenous bolus, \nand epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus once every 3–5 minutes as necessary according to \nclinical response. \n \nDepending on the severity of the allergic reaction, the rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment \ndiscontinued (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome is more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  It is recommended \nto administer oral metolazone or intravenous furosemide every 6–12 hours as required.  Supplemental \noxygen, respiratory support, and albumin replacement therapy should be used as necessary according to \nclinical response. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nCharacteristic symptoms and signs include hypotension, generalized oedema, ascites, dyspnoea, pulmonary \noedema and acute renal failure associated with hypoalbuminaemia and haemoconcentration. \n \nPain \nSevere pain (Grade 3 or 4) occurs most frequently during the first 4-day course of dinutuximab, often \nsubsiding over time with subsequent courses. \n \nFor severe pain, the Unituxin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.875 mg/m2/hour.  Unituxin should be \ndiscontinued if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum \nsupportive measures (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nParacetamol should be administered orally 20 minutes prior to starting each dinutuximab infusion, and \nrepeated every 4-6 hours as needed.  Regular dosing every 4–6 hours is recommended when IL-2 is \ncoadministered.  If required for persistent pain, ibuprofen should be administered orally every 6 hours \nbetween doses of paracetamol.  Ibuprofen should not be administered if there is evidence of \nthrombocytopenia, bleeding, or renal dysfunction. \n \nAn opioid, such as morphine sulphate, is recommended to be administered by intravenous infusion prior to \neach dinutuximab infusion and continued as an intravenous infusion during and until 2 hours after \ncompletion of the treatment.  It is recommended that additional intravenous bolus doses of an opioid are \nadministered as needed for treatment of pain up to once every 2 hours during the dinutuximab infusion.  If \nmorphine is not tolerated, then fentanyl or hydromorphone may be utilised. \n \nLidocaine may be administered as an intravenous infusion (2 mg/kg in 50 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride) \nover 30 minutes prior to the start of each dinutuximab infusion and continued via intravenous infusion at \n1 mg/kg/h up to 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  Lidocaine infusion should be discontinued if the \npatient develops dizziness, perioral numbness, or tinnitus. \n \nGabapentin may be administered at the time of starting morphine premedication, at an oral dose of \n10 mg/kg/day.  The dose may be subsequently increased (up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day or \n3600 mg/day) as needed for pain management. \n \nHypotension \nIntravenous sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (10 mL/kg) should be administered over \none hour just prior to the dinutuximab infusion.  If hypotension occurs, this can be repeated, or intravenous \nalbumin or packed red blood cells can be administered as clinically indicated.  It is recommended that \nvasopressor therapy is also administered if necessary to restore an adequate perfusion pressure. \n \nNeurological disorders of the eye \nEye disorders may occur, especially with repeated courses (see section 4.8).  These changes usually resolve \nover time.  Patients should have an ophthalmic examination before initiating therapy and be monitored for \nvisual changes. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \nRegular monitoring of liver function is recommended during dinutuximab immunotherapy. \n \nSystemic infections \nPatients typically have a central venous catheter in situ and as a consequence of prior ASCT are likely to be \nimmunocompromised during therapy, and therefore, at risk of developing systemic infection.  Patients \nshould have no evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be under control before \nbeginning therapy. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nElectrolyte abnormalities have been reported in patients who received Unituxin (see section 4.8). Electrolytes \nshould be monitored daily during therapy with Unituxin. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nAtypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome \nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, \nelectrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, and hypertension has been reported.  Supportive measures should be \ninstituted including control of hydration status, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, and anaemia. \n \nSodium intake \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially ‘sodium \nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.  A risk for interactions with concomitantly used medicinal \nproducts cannot be excluded. \n \nCorticosteroids \nIt is not recommended to use systemic corticosteroid medicinal products due to possible interference with \nimmune activation which is necessary for the therapeutic action of dinutuximab. \n \nIntravenous immunoglobulin \nIt is not recommended to use intravenous immunoglobulin after ASCT.  If necessary, its use must be limited \nto the first 100 days after ASCT, as immunoglobulin may interfere with dinutuximab-dependent cellular \ncytotoxicity.  Immunoglobulin must not be given within two weeks before and one week after completing \neach course of Unituxin. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nSevere allergic reactions are more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  Therefore caution \nshould be taken when both medicinal products are combined (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of dinutuximab in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Hence, this medicinal \nproduct is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  It is recommended that women of childbearing potential use contraception for 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Unituxin. \n \nBreast-feeding \nHuman IgG is known to be secreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the excretion of \ndinutuximab in human milk.  Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Unituxin.  The \nrecommended interval time between treatment discontinuation and breastfeeding is 6 months. \n \nFertility  \nThe effects of dinutuximab on fertility in humans are unknown.  In animals, fertility studies have not been \nconducted; however in male and female rats, no adverse effects on reproductive organs were observed (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUnituxin has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions reported in four clinical studies (ANBL0032, ANBL0931, CCG-0935A, and DIV-NB-\n201) of dinutuximab in patients (N=984) with high-risk neuroblastoma are summarized in Table 5.  Adverse \nreactions are defined as those adverse events that occurred at a higher frequency in the dinutuximab, GM-\nCSF, IL-2 and isotretinoin-treated group compared with the isotretinoin-treated control group during the \nANBL0032 randomised, controlled, pivotal study, and that have a plausible mechanistic relationship to \ntreatment with dinutuximab.  Originally reported terms have been coded to preferred terms (using the \nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]). \n \nTable 5 summarizes adverse drug reactions reported when dinutuximab was administered in combination \nwith GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin.  As this medicinal product is used in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, \nand isotretinoin, it is difficult to ascertain the causal relationship of each adverse reaction to a particular \nmedicinal product. \n \nThe most frequently occurring (more than 30% of patients) adverse reactions reported during the \nneuroblastoma studies were hypotension (67 %), pain (66 %), hypersensitivity (56 %), pyrexia (53 %), \nurticaria (49 %), capillary leak syndrome (45 %), anaemia (45 %), hypokalaemia (41 %), platelet count \ndecreased (40 %), hyponatraemia (37 %), alanine aminotransferase increased (35 %), decreased lymphocyte \ncount (34%) and decreased neutrophil count (31%).  Additional adverse reactions characteristic of an allergic \nresponse were also reported – including anaphylactic reaction (18 %) and bronchospasm (4 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported for subjects receiving dinutuximab in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and \nisotretinoin are summarised in Table 5.  These adverse reactions are presented by MedDRA system organ \nclass and frequency.  Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 5: Adverse reactions that have occurred during studies in high risk neuroblastoma patients receiving \ndinutuximab in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin. \n\nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common Uncommon \nInfections and \ninfestations  \n\n Device-related infection, \ninfection susceptibility \nincreased, bacteraemia, \nenterocolitis  \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nAnaemia Febrile neutropenia Atypical haemolytic \nuraemic syndrome \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nAnaphylactic reaction, \nhypersensitivity \n\nCytokine release \nsyndrome \n\nSerum sickness \n\nEndocrine disorders   Hyperthyroidism  \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, \nhypocalcaemia, \nhypophosphataemia, \nhypoalbuminaemia, \nhyperglycaemia, \ndecreased appetite \n\nHypomagnesaemia, \nacidosis, hypoglycaemia,  \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Neuralgia, peripheral \nneuropathy, headache \n\nPosterior reversible \nencephalopathy \nsyndrome \n\nEye disorders  Vision blurred, Unequal pupils  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ Class Very Common Common Uncommon \nphotophobia, mydriasis \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia (sinusal, \natrial, ventricular) \n\n Atrial fibrillation, \nventricular arrhythmia \n\nVascular disorders Capillary leak syndrome, \nhypotension, \nhypertension \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nHypoxia, cough,  \ndyspnoea \n\nBronchospasm, \npulmonary oedema  \n\nStridor, laryngeal \noedema \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, \nnausea \n\nConstipation, lower \ngastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUrticaria, pruritus Maculo-papular rash   \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Urinary retention, \nproteinuria, haematuria \n\nRenal failure \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia, pain1, face \noedema \n\nPeripheral oedema, \nchills, fatigue, irritability \nInjection site reaction \n\n \n\nInvestigations Decreased platelet count, \ndecreased lymphocyte \ncount, decreased white \nblood cell count, \ndecreased neutrophil \ncount, increased \naspartate \naminotransferase, \nincreased alanine \naminotransferase \n\nIncreased gamma-\nglutamyltransferase, \nincreased blood \ncreatinine, increased \nweight \n\nBlood culture positive \n\n1  Includes preferred terms abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, arthralgia, back pain, bladder pain, bone pain, chest \npain, facial pain, gingival pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia, neck pain, neuralgia, oropharyngeal pain, pain, \npain in extremity, and proctalgia. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nRefer to section 4.2 for advice on tapering off or discontinuation of this medicinal product.  Refer to \nsection 4.4 for actions to be taken for specific adverse reactions. \n \nAllergic reactions \nSerious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention including blood pressure support, bronchodilator \ntherapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of \nUnituxin included facial and upper airway oedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and \nhypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin \ninfusion.  Serious anaphylactic/allergic reactions were reported in 14% of patients.  Due to overlapping signs \nand symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity/allergic \nreactions in some cases. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome was a very common adverse reaction (45 % of patients) that occurred more \nfrequently when Unituxin was co-administered with IL-2; it was severe (> Grade 3) in 14% of patients.   \n \nPain \nPain typically occurred during the Unituxin infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, \ngeneralized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia; 41% of \npatients suffered severe pain.  Analgesics including intravenous opioids should be administered prior to each \ndose of Unituxin and continued until two hours following completion of Unituxin infusion. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nPeripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 3% of patients and peripheral motor neuropathy in 2% of \npatients; less than 1% of patients experienced serious peripheral neuropathy. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nElectrolyte abnormalities occurring in at least 25 % of patients who received Unituxin included \nhyponatraemia and hypokalaemia.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions that occur after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals \nare asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of dinutuximab overdose have been reported.  In clinical trials, scheduled dinutuximab doses of up \nto 120 mg/m2 (60 mg/m2/day) have been administered with an adverse reaction profile similar to that \ndescribed in section 4.8.  In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC16 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDinutuximab is a monoclonal chimeric antibody composed of murine variable heavy and light chain regions \nand the human constant region for the heavy chain IgG1 and light chain kappa.  Dinutuximab reacts \nspecifically with the ganglioside GD2, which is highly expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells and \nminimally expressed on the surface of normal human neurons, peripheral pain fibres, and skin melanocytes. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDinutuximab has been shown to bind to neuroblastoma cell lines known to express GD2 in vitro.  In \naddition, it has been shown to induce both antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and \ncomplement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro.  Specifically, in the presence of human effector cells including \nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and granulocytes from normal human donors, dinutuximab was \nfound to mediate the lysis of several neuroblastoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.  Granulocytes \nwere found to be more effective than PBMCs in mediating dinutuximab dependent cytotoxicity of \nneuroblastoma cells, with enhanced cell lysis observed with the addition of GM-CSF.  Additionally, in vivo \nstudies demonstrate that dinutuximab either alone or in combination with IL-2 can partially inhibit tumour \ngrowth in mice.  Augmentation of ADCC in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-2 provided the rationale for \ncombining these cytokines with dinutuximab in clinical studies. \n \nNon-clinical studies demonstrate that dinutuximab-induced neurotoxicity is likely due to the induction of \nmechanical allodynia that may be mediated by reactivity of dinutuximab with GD2 antigen located on the \nsurface of peripheral nerve fibres and/or myelin. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nANBL0032 was a randomised, controlled study that evaluated the effects of dinutuximab administered in \ncombination with GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin compared with isotretinoin alone in high-risk \nneuroblastoma subjects.  High-risk neuroblastoma was based on the patient age (greater than 12 months) and \ntumour stage at diagnosis and / or the presence of biological risk factors, such as MYCN amplification.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nPatients were aged 11 months to 15 years and had previously achieved at least a partial response to induction \nchemotherapy, followed by ASCT and radiotherapy.  Following ASCT, 226 subjects were randomly \nassigned 1:1 to either a standard therapy arm (six courses of isotretinoin) or a dinutuximab immunotherapy \narm (five courses of dinutuximab in combination with alternating GM-CSF and IL-2; combined with \nisotretinoin concurrently for six courses).  Dinutuximab was administered at a dose equivalent to \n17.5 mg/m2/day on four consecutive days (Days 4–7) of Courses 1–5. GM-CSF was administered at a dose \nof 250 μg/m2/day during Courses 1, 3, and 5 and dosed daily for 14 days.  IL-2 was administered \nconcurrently with dinutuximab as a continuous intravenous infusion for four days during Week 1 of Courses \n2 and 4 at a dose of 3.0 MIU/m2/day, and during Week 2 of Courses 2 and 4 at a dose of 4.5 MIU/m2/day.  \nDuring the last two weeks in each of the six courses, subjects in both the control and the dinutuximab \nimmunotherapy arms were also given oral isotretinoin at a dose of 160 mg/m2/day (given as 80 mg/m2 twice \ndaily). \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS) defined as time \nfrom randomization to the first occurrence of relapse, progressive disease, secondary malignancy, or death.  \nThe primary intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis found an improvement in EFS associated with dinutuximab \nimmunotherapy plus isotretinoin, as compared to isotretinoin alone.  The 2-year estimates of EFS were 66 % \namong subjects receiving dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin as compared with 48 % in subjects \nreceiving isotretinoin alone (log-rank test p = 0.033) although this difference did not reach formal statistical \nsignificance according to the pre-specified plan for interim analyses.  In addition, overall survival (OS) was \nevaluated with 3 years of follow-up after the EFS analysis as a secondary endpoint with a significant \nimprovement observed among ITT subjects randomly allocated to receive dinutuximab immunotherapy plus \nisotretinoin as compared with isotretinoin alone.  The 3-year estimates of OS were 80 % compared with \n67 % among subjects receiving dinutuximab immunotherapy plus isotretinoin and isotretinoin alone, \nrespectively (log-rank test p = 0.0165).  Long-term overall survival was evaluated with 5 years of follow up \nafter the EFS analysis and continued to demonstrate a survival advantage for patients who received \ndinutuximab immunotherapy compared to those who received isotretinoin alone.  The 5 year estimates of OS \nwere 74 % for dinutuximab immunotherapy compared to 57 % for isotretinoin alone (log-rank test \np = 0.030). \n \nSubgroup analyses of EFS and OS response indicated that patients with minimal residual disease, DNA \nhyperploidy, and those having received a purged bone marrow may not have benefited from dinutuximab \nimmunotherapy. \n\nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  Data from 409 subjects participating \nin several neuroblastoma studies and having samples available for the determination of human anti-chimeric \nantibodies (HACA) demonstrated that 71 (17%) developed binding antibodies and 15 (4%) developed a \nneutralising antibody response.  Plasma concentrations of dinutuximab, especially trough levels, tended to be \nlower in patients with HACA.  There was no apparent correlation between the development of these \nantibodies and allergic reactions. \n \nThe incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay \nand for these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dinutuximab with the incidence of \nantibodies to other products may be misleading. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Unituxin in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in neuroblastoma (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab were evaluated in a clinical study of Unituxin in combination with \nGM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin.  In this study, 27 children with high-risk neuroblastoma \n(age: 3.9 ± 1.9 years) received up to 5 cycles of Unituxin at 17.5 mg/m2/day as an intravenous infusion over \n10 to 20 hours for 4 consecutive days every 28 days.  The mean (± standard deviation) maximum plasma \nconcentration observed after the 4th infusion was 11.5 (± 2.3) mcg/mL.  In a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis, the geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state was estimated at 5.2 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDinutuximab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and \nindividual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes.  Classical biotransformation studies have not been \nperformed. \n \nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean clearance was estimated at 0.025 L/hr and increased with body size.  The terminal half-\nlife was estimated at 10 (+ 6) days. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted on all clinical data available suggests that the disposition \nof dinutuximab is not altered by age, race, gender, concomitant medications (IL-2, GM-CSF) and the \npresence of capillary leak syndrome, renal or hepatic impairment. However, the presence of HACA appears \nto increase the clearance of dinutuximab by approximately 60%. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGeneral toxicology \n \nDinutuximab (or the murine monoclonal antibody 14.18) has been administered to mice, rabbits, rats, and \ndogs in single- or repeat-dose regimens that exceed the dose that is used clinically.  Findings of note included \ntreatment related adverse reactions of the liver in rats (characterized by centrilobular congestion, abnormal \ncell division, hepatocellular necrosis and pericentral vein/interlobular fibrosis) which may be related to \ncirculatory disturbances and changes indicative of increased haematopoiesis (high reticulocyte ratio and/or \nplatelet count, increased cellularity of the haematopoietic cells in the femoral and sternal bone marrow, \nand/or extramedullary haematopoiesis in the liver and spleen).  These changes were noted to be very slight to \nslight in severity and recovered or tended to recover following the cessation of dosing.  No clinical signs of \nCNS toxicity were observed. \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nDinutuximab was administered to cynomolgous monkeys resulting in effects on the cardiovascular system, \nwhich consisted of moderate increases in blood pressure (one of three animals) and heart rate (two of three \nanimals).  No direct effects on electrocardiogram parameters or on the respiratory system were observed. \n \nOther \n \nNo non-clinical studies to evaluate the potential of dinutuximab to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or \ndevelopmental and reproductive toxicity  have been conducted.  In male and female rats, administration of \ndinutuximab resulted in no adverse effects on reproductive organs at exposures that were at least 60-fold \nhigher than those observed clinically.   \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies conducted to date.  \nThese studies support the current dinutuximab dosing regimen of 17.5 mg/m2/day administered for \nfour consecutive days during five monthly courses. \n \n6.

What Unituxin is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Unituxin is \n \nUnituxin is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance dinutuximab.  It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called ‘monoclonal antibodies’.  These work like the antibodies produced naturally by the body.  \nThey help the immune system to target certain cells, such as cancer cells, by ‘sticking’ to them.  \n \nWhat Unituxin is used for \n \nUnituxin is used to treat ‘high-risk neuroblastoma’ in babies, children and adolescents aged 12 months to \n17 years old. \n \nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body. Some neuroblastomas \nare classed as ‘high risk’ if the cancer has spread to various parts of the body and contains certain types of \ncells. High-risk neuroblastomas are more likely to come back again after treatment. \n \nTo reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, Unituxin is given at the last stage of the treatment to eliminate \nsmall amounts of disease which may still be present after the cancer has responded to chemotherapy, surgery, \nand an autologous (self-donating) blood cell transplant.  \n \nHow Unituxin works \n \nUnituxin recognises and attaches to a cell surface target called ‘GD2’.  GD2 is found on the surface of \nneuroblastoma cells.  When Unituxin attaches to the GD2 on the cancer cells, the patient’s immune system \nstarts to attack these cells and kill them. \n \nUnituxin has been shown to delay the progression or relapse of the disease and to increase survival. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Unituxin \n \nDo not take Unituxin if \n- you are allergic to dinutuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given dinutuximab. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Unituxin if: \n- you have ever had fits (convulsions)  \n- you have liver problems \n- you have a low number of white blood cells or platelets in your blood – shown in tests \n- you have breathing problems such as shortness of breath when resting  \n- you have kidney problems \n- you have any infections. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before being given \nUnituxin. \n \nYou might notice the following when you first receive Unituxin and during the course of treatment: \n\n• Allergic reactions, which may be severe (anaphylactic reactions), or other reactions to the \ninfusion – Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any kind of reaction during or after \nthe infusion.  These are very common (affecting more than 1 in 10 people).  Signs of an allergic \nreaction may include skin rash, hives, swelling in the face or throat, dizziness, a rapid heart beat or \npalpitations, being short of breath and difficulty breathing, fever, feeling sick, aches and pains in \nyour joints.  You will be closely monitored for these signs while being given the medicine.  You will \nbe given an anti-histamine medicine which helps to prevent allergic reactions. \n \n\n• Capillary Leak Syndrome due to leakage of blood components through small blood vessel walls - \nthis may cause rapid swelling to arms, legs and other parts of your body, rapid drop in blood \npressure, lightheadedness and breathing difficulties \n \n\n• Pain – tell your doctor or nurse if you get any pain.  This is very common during treatment \n(affecting more than 1 in 10 people).  You will be given pain relieving medicines (such as \nparacetamol, ibuprofen and morphine) to help prevent and reduce the pain.  See section 4 for more \ninformation about pain side effects. \n \n\n• Low blood pressure – this may make you feel dizzy or faint. \n \n\n• Problems with your eyes – tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any problems with your eyes or \nchanges to your vision. \n \n\n• Infections of the blood – tell your doctor if you notice fever, shaking chills, or feel faint or dizzy. \n \n\n• Problems with your nerves – you may notice numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet, \nlegs or arms, reduced sensation or weakness with movement (peripheral neuropathy). \n\n \nSee section 4 for a full list of known side effects. \n \nTests and checks \n \nYour doctor will do blood tests and may do eye tests while you are taking this medicine. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nOther medicines and Unituxin \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you have recently received: \n- medicines called ‘corticosteroids’ – these can affect the activity of your immune system which is \n\nimportant for Unituxin to work. \n- ‘intravenous immunoglobulin’ – you should not have this type of medicine in the two weeks before \n\nUnituxin treatment and for at least one week after treatment has finished. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor or nurse before you are given \nUnituxin. \n \nPregnancy \n \n• If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse \n\nfor advice before being given this medicine. \n• If it is possible for you to become pregnant and you are not using contraception, talk to your doctor \n\nbefore being given this medicine. \n• It is recommended to use contraception for 6 months after discontinuation of this medicine. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \n• If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor or nurse before being given this medicine. \n• You should not breastfeed during treatment with this medicine.  This is because it is not known if the \n\nmedicine can pass into breast-milk.  The recommended interval time between treatment discontinuation \nand breastfeeding is 6 months. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nUnituxin has many side effects, and this will affect your ability to drive and use machines \n \nUnituxin contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially ‘sodiumfree’. \n \n3. How Unituxin will be given \n \nUnituxin will be given to you by a doctor or nurse while you are in hospital.  It is given as a drip into one of \nyour veins (intravenous infusion). \nUnituxin is used with three other medicines: \n- Isotretinoin \n- GM-CSF \n- IL-2 \nThese medicines will be given to you over six courses.  Each course lasts one month.  You will not be given \nall of the medicines in every course. \n \nHow much is given \n \nUnituxin will be given to you in five of the six courses.  The recommended dose is 17.5 mg/m2.  Your doctor \nwill work out your dose based on your body surface area. \n \nDuring courses (months) 1, 3 and 5 \n \n• Unituxin is given as a drip into one of your veins – for about 10 hours each day for four days. \n• GM-CSF is given as either an injection under the skin or as a drip into one of your veins each day for \n\n14 days. \n• You will be given isotretinoin to take by mouth for the last 14 days of each course. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nDuring courses (months) 2 and 4 \n \n• Unituxin is given as a drip into one of your veins – for about 10 hours each day for four days. \n• IL-2 is given as a drip into one of your veins for four days in a row (continuous infustion) – for the first \n\nfour days of the first week and the first four days of the second week of each course. \n• You will be given isotretinoin to take by mouth for the last 14 days of each course. \n \nDuring course (month) 6 \n \n• You will only be given isotretinoin to take by mouth. \n\n \nYour doctor or nurse will check you during and after the infusion.  To reduce the risk of side effects, your \ndoctor may increase the time allowed for the Unituxin infusion up to 20 hours.  If you have any further \nquestions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n4.

It should be administered by \nintravenous infusion over 10 hours.  The infusion is started at a dose rate of 0.875 mg/m2/h and continued at \nthis rate for 30 minutes; the rate is then increased to 1.75 mg/m2/h and continued at this rate for the \nremainder of the infusion, if tolerated.  The infusion duration may be extended up to 20 hours to help \nminimise reactions during infusion that do not respond adequately to other supportive measures.  The \ninfusion must be terminated after 20 hours, even if the full dose cannot be delivered within this timeframe. \n \nPre-medication should always be considered before starting each infusion. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6 of the SmPC. \n \nContraindications \n \nHypersensitivity (Grade 4) to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the \nSmPC. \n \nSpecial warnings and precautions for use \n \nAllergic reactions \nAntihistamine premedication (e.g. hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine) should be administered by intravenous \ninjection approximately 20 minutes before starting each dinutuximab infusion.  It is recommended that \nantihistamine medicinal product be repeated every 4–6 hours as required during infusion of Unituxin.  \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions for 4 hours after the completion \nof the Unituxin infusion. \n \nEpinephrine (adrenaline) and hydrocortisone for intravenous administration should be immediately available \nat the bedside during administration of dinutuximab to manage life-threatening allergic reactions.  It is \nrecommended that treatment for such reactions include hydrocortisone administered by intravenous bolus, \nand epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus once every 3–5 minutes as necessary according to \nclinical response. \n \nDepending on the severity of the allergic reaction, the rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment \ndiscontinued. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome is more likely when dinutuximab is co-administered with IL-2.  It is recommended \nto administer oral metolazone or intravenous furosemide every 6–12 hours as required.  Supplemental \noxygen, respiratory support, and albumin replacement therapy should be used as necessary according to \nclinical response. \n \nCharacteristic symptoms and signs include hypotension, generalized oedema, ascites, dyspnoea, pulmonary \noedema and acute renal failure associated with hypoalbuminaemia and haemoconcentration. \n \nPain \nSevere pain (Grade 3 or 4) occurs most frequently during the first 4-day course of dinutuximab, often \nsubsiding over time with subsequent courses. \n \nFor severe pain, the Unituxin infusion rate should be decreased to 0.875 mg/m2/hour.  Unituxin should be \ndiscontinued if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum \nsupportive measures. \n \nParacetamol should be administered orally 20 minutes prior to starting each dinutuximab infusion, and \nrepeated every 4-6 hours as needed.  Regular dosing every 4–6 hours is recommended when IL-2 is \ncoadministered.  If required for persistent pain, ibuprofen should be administered orally every 6 hours \nbetween doses of paracetamol.  Ibuprofen should not be administered if there is evidence of \nthrombocytopenia, bleeding, or renal dysfunction. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nAn opioid, such as morphine sulphate, is recommended to be administered by intravenous infusion prior to \neach dinutuximab infusion and continued as an intravenous infusion during and until 2 hours after \ncompletion of the treatment.  It is recommended that additional intravenous bolus doses of an opioid are \nadministered as needed for treatment of pain up to once every 2 hours during the dinutuximab infusion.  If \nmorphine is not tolerated, then fentanyl or hydromorphone may be utilised. \n \nLidocaine may be administered as an intravenous infusion (2 mg/kg in 50 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride) \nover 30 minutes prior to the start of each dinutuximab infusion and continued via intravenous infusion at \n1 mg/kg/h up to 2 hours after completion of the treatment.  Lidocaine infusion should be discontinued if the \npatient develops dizziness, perioral numbness, or tinnitus. \n \nGabapentin may be administered at the time of starting morphine premedication, at an oral dose of \n10 mg/kg/day.  The dose may be subsequently increased (up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day or \n3600 mg/day) as needed for pain management. \n \nHypotension \nIntravenous sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (10 mL/kg) should be administered over \none hour just prior to the dinutuximab infusion.  If hypotension occurs, this can be repeated, or intravenous \nalbumin or packed red blood cells can be administered as clinically indicated.  It is recommended that \nvasopressor therapy is also administered if necessary to restore an adequate perfusion pressure. \n \nNeurological disorders of the eye \nEye disorders may occur, especially with repeated courses.  These changes usually resolve over time.  \nPatients should have an ophthalmic examination before initiating therapy and be monitored for visual \nchanges. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \nRegular monitoring of liver function is recommended during dinutuximab immunotherapy. \n \nSystemic infections \nPatients typically have a central venous catheter in situ and as a consequence of prior ASCT are likely to be \nimmunocompromised during therapy, and therefore, at risk of developing systemic infection.  Patients \nshould have no evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be under control before \nbeginning therapy. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nElectrolyte abnormalities have been reported in patients who received Unituxin. Electrolytes should be \nmonitored daily during therapy with Unituxin. \n \nAtypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome \nHaemolytic uraemic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, \nelectrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, and hypertension has been reported.  Supportive measures should be \ninstituted including control of hydration status, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, and anaemia. \n \nSodium intake \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose.  This means it is essentially ‘sodium \nfree’. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
