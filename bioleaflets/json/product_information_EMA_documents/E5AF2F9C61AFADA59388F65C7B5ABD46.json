NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nREGRANEX 0.01% gel  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nEach gram of gel contains 100 Î¼g of becaplermin*.   \n* Recombinant human Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) produced in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology.  \n\nExcipients: \nEach gram contains E218 (methyl parahydroxybenzoate) 1.56 mg and E216 (propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate) 0.17 mg, see section 4.4.  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel.  \n \nREGRANEX is a clear colourless to straw-coloured gel. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nREGRANEX is indicated, in association with other good wound care measures, to promote \ngranulation and thereby the healing of full-thickness, neuropathic, chronic, diabetic ulcers less than \nor equal to 5 cm2. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with REGRANEX should be initiated and monitored by physicians (specialists or non-\nspecialists) who are experienced in the management of diabetic wounds. \n \nREGRANEX should always be used in conjunction with good wound care consisting of initial \ndebridement (to remove all the necrotic and/or infected tissue), additional debridement as necessary \nand a non-weight-bearing regimen to alleviate pressure on the ulcer.  \n \nREGRANEX should be applied as a continuous thin layer to the entire ulcerated area(s) once daily using \na clean application aid. The site(s) of application should then be covered by a moist saline gauze dressing \nthat maintains a moist wound-healing environment. REGRANEX should not be used in conjunction with \nocclusive dressings. \n \n- A tube of REGRANEX should be used on a single patient only. \n- Care should be taken during use to avoid microbial contamination and spoilage. \n- Hands should be washed thoroughly before applying REGRANEX.  \n- The tip of the tube should not come into contact with the wound or any other surface.  \n- The use of a clean application aid is recommended and contact with other parts of the body should \n\nbe avoided.  \n- Before each application, the ulcer should be gently rinsed with saline or water to remove residual \n\ngel. \n- The tube should be closed tightly after each use.  \n \n\n 2\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nREGRANEX should not be used for more than 20 weeks. \n \nIf during treatment with REGRANEX no meaningful healing progress is evident after the first ten \nweeks of continuous therapy, treatment should be re-evaluated, and factors known to compromise \nhealing (such as osteomyelitis, ischaemia, infection) should be re-assessed. Therapy should be \ncontinued to the maximum of 20 weeks as long as healing progress is seen on periodic evaluations.  \n \nSpecial population \nPaediatric population \nSafety and effectiveness in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  \n- Any known malignancies (See section 4.4). \n-  In patients with clinically infected ulcers. (See section 4.4).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMalignancies distant from the site of application have occurred in becaplermin users in both clinical \ntrial and in post-marketing use. In view of these data and since becaplermin is a growth factor, \nRegranex treatment is contraindicated in patients with any known malignancies. \n \nPrior to the use of REGRANEX, related underlying conditions such as osteomyelitis and peripheral \narteriopathy should be excluded or treated if present. Osteomyelitis should be assessed by X-ray \nexamination. Peripheral arteriopathy should be excluded by assessment of the pedal pulses or other \ntechniques. Ulcers with a suspicious appearance should be biopsied to exclude malignancy. \n \nWound infection should be treated prior to the use of REGRANEX.  If a wound becomes infected \nduring REGRANEX therapy, the product should be discontinued until the infection has cleared.  \n \nREGRANEX should not be used in patients with ulcers that are not of primarily neuropathic origin, such \nas those due to arteriopathy or other factors. \n\nREGRANEX should not be used in ulcers of baseline surface area > 5 cm2, or for more than 20 weeks in \nany individual. There are insufficient data to support safe use of the product for more than 20 weeks  \n(see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Efficacy has not been demonstrated for ulcers of baseline surface \narea > 5 cm2. \n \nREGRANEX contains E218 (methyl parahydroxybenzoate) and E216 (propyl parahydroxybenzoate).  \nThese may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.  Consequently, it is recommended that REGRANEX should \nnot be applied to the ulcer site in conjunction with other topical medications. \n \n \n \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of becaplermin in pregnant women.  Consequently, \nREGRANEX should not be used during pregnancy. \n\n 3\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nBreastfeeding  \n \nIt is not known whether becaplermin is excreted in human milk. Therefore, REGRANEX should not be \nused during breastfeeding. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of REGRANEX Gel was evaluated in 1883 adult patients who participated in 17 clinical \ntrials of REGRANEX and placebo and/or standard therapy (saline dressing). These 1883 patients had \nat least one topical administration of REGRANEX and provided safety data. Based on pooled safety \ndata from these clinical trials, the most commonly reported (â¥5% incidence) adverse drug reactions \n(ADRs) were (with % incidence) infected skin ulcer (12.3), cellulitis (10.3), and osteomyelitis (7.2). \nIncluding the above-mentioned ADRs, the following table displays ADRs that have been reported with \nthe use of REGRANEX from either clinical trial or postmarketing experiences.  \n \nThe displayed frequency categories use the following convention: very common (â¥1/10); common \n(â¥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (â¥1/1000 to <1/100); rare (â¥1/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available clinical trial data).  \n \n\nAdverse Drug Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Experience \n\nSystem Organ Class \n\nAdverse Drug Reactions \nFrequency Category \n\nVery Common \n(â¥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(â¥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(â¥1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nRare \n(â¥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\n\nInfections and Infestations Infected skin ulcer,Cellulitis Osteomyelitis   \n\nNervous System Disorders   Burning sensation1  \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous \nTissue Disorders  Rash, Erythema\n\n2  \nDermatitis bullous, \n\nExcessive granulation \ntissue \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site \n\nConditions \n Pain  Oedema \n\n1. The bundled term burning sensation consists of the preferred terms burning sensation, skin \nburning sensation, and application site irritation, all of which referred specifically to burning at \nthe application site. \n\n2. Refers to erythema at the application site. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited data on the effects of becaplermin overdose. Since there was no consistent increase \nin plasma platelet-derived growth factor-BB concentrations above pre-treatment concentrations, \nfollowing 14 consecutive daily topical applications to ulcers, no untoward systemic events are \nexpected.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Preparation for treatment of wounds and ulcers, ATC code: D 03 AX06 \n\n 4\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nREGRANEX contains becaplermin, a recombinant human Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB \n(rhPDGF-BB). Becaplermin is produced by insertion of the gene for the B chain of human platelet \nderived growth factor into the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological activity of becaplermin \nincludes promoting the chemotactic recruitment and proliferation of cells involved in wound repair. Thus \nit helps the growth of normal tissue for healing. In animal wound models, the predominant effect of \nbecaplermin is to enhance the formation of granulation tissue. From data combined from 4 clinical trials \nconducted over a 20 week treatment phase for ulcers of baseline surface area less than or equal to \n5 cm2, 47% of ulcers treated with becaplermin 100 Î¼g/g gel completely healed, compared to 35% \nwhich were treated with placebo gel alone. Subjects recruited into these studies were diabetic adults \naged 19 years or over who were suffering from at least one stage III or IV diabetic ulcer of at least 8 \nweeks duration.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nClinical absorption studies were conducted in patients with a mean diabetic ulcer area of 10.5 cmÂ² \n(range 2.3 - 43.5 cmÂ²). Following 14 consecutive daily topical applications of REGRANEX, there was \nno consistent increase in plasma platelet-derived growth factor-BB concentrations above pre-treatment \nconcentrations.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBecaplermin was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. Since there was no consistent \nincrease in plasma platelet-derived growth factor-BB concentrations above pre-treatment concentra-\ntions, following 14 consecutive daily topical applications to ulcers in man, carcinogenesis and \nreproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with REGRANEX. In the process of healing the \nwound, becaplermin induces cell proliferation.  \nIn a preclinical study designed to determine the effects of PDGF on exposed bone, rats injected at the \nmetatarsals with 3 or 10 Î¼g/site (concentration of 30 or 100 Î¼g/ml/site) of becaplermin every other day \nfor 13 days displayed histological changes indicative of accelerated bone remodelling consisting of \nperiosteal hyperplasia and subperiosteal bone resorption and exostosis. The soft tissue adjacent to the \ninjection site had fibroplasia with accompanying mononuclear cell infiltration reflective of the ability \nof PDGF to stimulate connective tissue growth. \n \nPreclinical absorption studies through full-thickness wounds were conducted in rats with a wound area \nof 1.4 - 1.6 cmÂ². Systemic absorption of a single dose and multiple applications for 5 consecutive days \nof becaplermin to those wounds was insignificant.  \n \n \n6.
