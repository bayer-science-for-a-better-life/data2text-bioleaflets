This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPifeltro 100 mg film-coated tablets.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of doravirine.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach film-coated tablet contains 222 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\n\nWhite, oval-shaped, tablet of dimensions 19.00 mm x 9.50 mm, debossed with the corporate logo and \n700 on one side and plain on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPifeltro is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of \nadults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is one 100 mg tablet taken orally once daily with or without food.\n\nDose adjustment\nIf Pifeltro is co-administered with rifabutin, one 100 mg tablet of Pifeltro should be taken twice daily \n(approximately 12 hours apart) (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but \ndecreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with other moderate CYP3A \ninducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl) \ncannot be avoided, one 100 mg tablet of Pifeltro should be taken twice daily (approximately 12 hours \napart).\n\nMissed dose\nIf the patient misses a dose of Pifeltro within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose by more \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nthan 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the \nregularly scheduled time. The patient should not take 2 doses at one time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment of doravirine is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal \nimpairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease and has not been \nstudied in dialysis patients (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). It is not known whether the exposure to doravirine will \nincrease in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised when doravirine is \nadministered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and efficacy of doravirine have not been established in patients younger than 18 years of age.\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nPifeltro must be taken orally, once daily with or without food and swallowed whole (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with medicinal products that are strong cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzyme inducers\nis contraindicated as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, \nwhich may decrease the effectiveness of Pifeltro (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). These medicinal products\ninclude, but are not limited, to the following:\n carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n rifampicin, rifapentine\n St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\n mitotane\n enzalutamide\n lumacaftor\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nNNRTI substitutions and use of doravirine\nDoravirine has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral \ntherapy. NNRTI-associated mutations detected at screening were part of exclusion criteria in the Phase \n2b/3-studies. A breakpoint for a reduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions,\nthat is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy has not been established (see section 5.1). There \nis not sufficient clinical evidence to support the use of doravirine in patients infected with HIV-1 with \nevidence of resistance to the NNRTI class.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nUse with CYP3A inducers\nCaution should be given to prescribing doravirine with medicinal products that may reduce the \nexposure of doravirine (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nImmune reactivation syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune \nsystem responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic \ninfections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, autoimmune hepatitis, polymyositis, and Guillain-\nBarré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the \ntime to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nLactose\nThe tablets contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on doravirine\nDoravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A \nare expected to affect the clearance of doravirine (see section 5.2). Doravirine should not be co-\nadministered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzyme inducers as significant decreases \nin doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of \ndoravirine (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nCo-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin decreased doravirine concentrations\n(see Table 1). When doravirine is co-administered with rifabutin, the doravirine dose should be \nincreased to 100 mg twice daily (the doses should be taken approximately 12 hours apart) (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but \ndecreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with other moderate CYP3A \ninducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl) \ncannot be avoided, the doravirine dose should be increased to 100 mg twice daily (the doses should be \ntaken approximately 12 hours apart) (see section 4.2).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine and medicinal products that are inhibitors of CYP3A may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of doravirine. However, no dose adjustment is needed when \ndoravirine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.\n\nEffects of doravirine on other medicinal products\nDoravirine at a dose of 100 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the \nplasma concentrations of medicinal products that are dependent on transport proteins for absorption \nand/or elimination or that are metabolized by CYP enzymes.\n\nHowever, co-administration of doravirine and the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam resulted in a \n18 % decrease in midazolam exposure, suggesting that doravirine may be a weak CYP3A inducer. \nTherefore caution should be used when co-administering doravirine with medicinal products that are \nsensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., tacrolimus and \nsirolimus).\n\nInteractions table\nTable 1 shows the established and other potential medicinal product interactions with doravirine but is \nnot all inclusive (increase is indicated as , decrease is indicated as ↓, and no change as ↔).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nTable 1: Interactions of doravirine with other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal Product by \nTherapeutic Area\n\nEffects on Medicinal Product \nLevels Geometric Mean Ratio \n\n(90 % CI)*\n\nRecommendation Concerning \nCo-administration with \n\ndoravirine\nAcid-Reducing Agents\n\nantacid (aluminium and \nmagnesium hydroxide oral \nsuspension)\n(20 mL SD,\ndoravirine 100 mg SD)\n\n doravirine\nAUC 1.01 (0.92, 1.11)\nCmax 0.86 (0.74, 1.01)\nC24 1.03 (0.94, 1.12)\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\npantoprazole\n(40 mg QD,\ndoravirine 100 mg SD)\n\n doravirine\nAUC 0.83 (0.76, 0.91)\nCmax 0.88 (0.76, 1.01)\nC24 0.84 (0.77, 0.92)\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nomeprazole\n\nInteraction not studied.\n\nExpected:\n doravirine\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors\n\nlisinopril\n\nInteraction not studied.\n\nExpected:\n↔ lisinopril\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nAntiandrogens\n\nenzalutamide\n\nInteraction not studied.\n\nExpected:\n doravirine\n(Induction of CYP3A)\n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated.\n\nAntibiotics\n\nnafcillin\n\nInteraction not studied.\n\nExpected:\n↓ doravirine\n(Induction of CYP3A)\n\nCo-administration should be \navoided.

Physicians are encouraged to \nregister patients in this registry.\n\nAnimal studies with doravirine do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of doravirine during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether doravirine is excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of doravirine in milk (see \nsection 5.3).\nBecause of the potential for HIV-1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving Pifeltro.\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of doravirine on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of doravirine on fertility at exposure levels higher than the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended clinical dose (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPifeltro may have a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence have been reported during treatment with doravirine\n(see section 4.8). This should be considered when assessing a patient's ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to doravirine\nwere nausea (4 %) and headache (3 %).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).\n\nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with doravirine used in \ncombination with other antiretrovirals\n\nFrequency Adverse reactions\n\nInfections and infestations\nRare rash pustular\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon hypophosphataemia\nRare hypomagnesaemia\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nFrequency Adverse reactions\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nCommon abnormal dreams, insomnia1\n\nUncommon nightmare, depression2, anxiety3, irritability, \nconfusional state, suicidal ideation\n\nRare aggression, hallucination, adjustment disorder, \nmood altered, somnambulism\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon headache, dizziness, somnolence\nUncommon disturbance in attention, memory impairment, \n\nparaesthesia, hypertonia, poor quality sleep\nVascular disorders\nUncommon hypertension\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nRare dyspnoea, tonsillar hypertrophy\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon nausea, diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain4, \n\nvomiting\nUncommon constipation, abdominal discomfort5, abdominal \n\ndistension, dyspepsia, faeces soft6, \ngastrointestinal motility disorder7\n\nRare rectal tenesmus\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon rash8\n\nUncommon pruritus \nRare dermatitis allergic, rosacea\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon myalgia, arthralgia\nRare musculoskeletal pain\nRenal and urinary disorders\nRare acute kidney injury, renal disorder, calculus \n\nurinary, nephrolithiasis \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon fatigue \nUncommon asthenia, malaise \nRare chest pain, chills, pain, thirst\nInvestigations\nCommon alanine aminotransferase increased9\n\nUncommon lipase increased, aspartate aminotransferase \nincreased, amylase increased, haemoglobin \ndecreased\n\nRare blood creatine phosphokinase increased\n1insomnia includes: insomnia, initial insomnia and sleep disorder\n2depression includes: depression, depressed mood, major depression, and persistent depressive disorder\n3anxiety includes: anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder\n4abdominal pain includes: abdominal pain, and abdominal pain upper\n5abdominal discomfort includes: abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort\n6faeces soft includes: faeces soft and abnormal faeces\n7gastrointestinal motility disorder includes: gastrointestinal motility disorder, and frequent bowel movements\n8rash includes: rash, rash macular, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, and urticarial\n9alanine aminotransferase increased includes: alanine aminotransferase increased and hepatocellular injury\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no information on potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose with doravirine.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, ATC code: J05AG06\n\nMechanism of action\nDoravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 \nreplication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Doravirine does not \ninhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, ß, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.\n\nAntiviral activity in cell culture\nDoravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12.0±4.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1 \nwhen tested in the presence of 100 % normal human serum using MT4-GFP reporter cells. Doravirine \ndemonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B, \nBF, C, D, G, H) with EC50 values ranging from 1.2 nM to 10.0 nM.\n\nAntiviral activity in combination with other HIV antiviral medicinal products\nThe antiviral activity of doravirine was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine, \nefavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, or rilpivirine; the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil, or zidovudine; the PIs darunavir or indinavir; the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc; or the integrase strand transfer \ninhibitor raltegravir.\n\nResistance\n\nIn cell culture\nDoravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different \norigins and subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. Observed emergent amino acid substitutions \nin RT included: V106A, V106M, V106I, V108I, F227L, F227C, F227V, H221Y, M230I, L234I, \nP236L, and Y318F. Common NNRTI-resistant mutations (K103N, Y181C) were not selected in the \nin vitro study. V106A (yielding a fold change of around 19) appeared as an initial substitution in \nsubtype B virus, and V106A or M in subtype A and C virus. Subsequently F227(L/C/V) or L234I \nemerged in addition to V106 substitution (double mutants yielding a fold change of > 100).\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\nIn clinical trials\nTreatment-naïve adult subjects\nThe Phase 3 studies, DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD, included previously untreated \npatients (n = 747) where the following NNRTI substitutions were part of exclusion criteria: L100I, \nK101E, K101P, K103N, K103S, V106A, V106I, V106M, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, \nE138R, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, G190A, G190S, H221Y, L234I, \nM230I, M230L, P225H, F227C, F227L, F227V.\n\nThe following de novo resistance was seen in the resistance analysis subset (subjects with HIV-1 RNA \ngreater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or early study discontinuation and having resistance \ndata).\n\nTable 3: Resistance development up to week 96 in protocol defined virologic failure population + \nearly discontinuation population\n\nDRIVE-FORWARD DRIVE-AHEAD\nDOR + \nNRTIs*\n(383)\n\nDRV + r +\nNRTIs*\n(383)\n\nDOR/TDF/3TC\n(364)\n\nEFV/TDF/FTC \n(364)\n\nSuccessful genotype, n 15 18 32 33\n\nGenotypic resistance to\n\nDOR or control (DRV or EFV) 2 (DOR) 0 (DRV) 8 (DOR) 14 (EFV)\n\nNRTI backbone \nM184I/V only\nK65R only\nK65R + M184I/V\n\n2**\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n6\n4\n1\n1\n\n5\n4\n0\n1\n\n*NRTIs in DOR arm: FTC/TDF (333) or ABC/3TC (50); NRTIs in DRV+r arm: FTC/TDF (335) or ABC/3TC (48)\n**Subjects received FTC/TDF\nABC=abacavir; FTC=emtricitabine; DRV=darunavir; r=ritonavir\n\nEmergent doravirine associated resistance substitutions in RT included one or more of the following: \nA98G, V106I, V106A, V106M/T, Y188L, H221Y, P225H, F227C, F227C/R, and Y318Y/F.\n\nVirologically suppressed adult subjects\nThe DRIVE-SHIFT study included virologically suppressed patients (N=670) with no history of \ntreatment failure (see section, Clinical experience). A documented absence of genotypic resistance \n(prior to starting first therapy) to doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir was part of the inclusion \ncriteria for patients who switched from a PI- or INI-based regimen.  Exclusionary NNRTI \nsubstitutions were those listed above (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD), with the exception \nof substitutions RT K103N, G190A and Y181C (accepted in DRIVE-SHIFT). Documentation of pre-\ntreatment resistance genotyping was not required for patients who switched from a NNRTI-based \nregimen.\n\nIn the DRIVE-SHIFT clinical trial, no subjects developed genotypic or phenotypic resistance to DOR, \n3TC, or TDF during the initial 48 weeks (immediate switch, N=447) or 24 weeks (delayed switch, \nN=209) of treatment with DOR/3TC/TDF.  One subject developed RT M184M/I mutation and \nphenotypic resistance to 3TC and FTC during treatment with their baseline regimen.  None of the \n24 subjects (11 in the immediate switch group, 13 in the delayed switch group) with baseline NNRTI \nmutations (RT K103N, G190A, or Y181C) experienced virologic failure through Week 48, or at time \nof discontinuation.\n\nCross-resistance\nDoravirine has been evaluated in a limited number of patients with NNRTI resistance (K103N n=7, \nG190A n=1); all patients were suppressed to < 40 copies/mL at week 48. A breakpoint for a reduction \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nin susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions, that is associated with a reduction in clinical \nefficacy has not been established.\n\nLaboratory strains of HIV-1 harbouring the common NNRTI-associated mutations K103N, Y181C, or \nK103N/Y181C substitutions in RT exhibit less than a 3-fold decrease in susceptibility to doravirine \ncompared to wild-type virus when evaluated in the presence of 100 % normal human serum. In in vitro\nstudies, doravirine was able to suppress the following NNRTI-associated substitutions; K103N, \nY181C, and G190A under clinically relevant concentrations.\n\nA panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI-associated mutations was evaluated for \nsusceptibility to doravirine in the presence of 10 % foetal bovine serum. Clinical isolates containing \nthe Y188L substitution or V106 substitutions in combination with A98G, H221Y, P225H, F227C or \nY318F showed a greater than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine. Other established NNRTI \nsubstitutions yielded a fold change of 5-10 (G190S (5.7), K103N/P225H (7.9), V108I/Y181C (6.9), \nY181V (5.1)). The clinical relevance of a 5-10 fold reduction in susceptibility is unknown.\n\nTreatment emergent doravirine resistance associated substitutions may confer cross resistance to \nefavirenz, rilpivirine, nevirapine, and etravirine. Of the 7 subjects who developed high level doravirine \nresistance in the pivotal studies, 6 had phenotypic resistance to EFV and nevirapine, 3 to rilpivirine, \nand 2 had partial resistance to etravirine based on the Monogram Phenosense assay.\n\nClinical experience\n\nTreatment-naïve adult subjects\nThe efficacy of doravirine is based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, multicentre, \ndouble-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials, (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD) in \nantiretroviral treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 1494). Refer to Resistance section for \nNNRTI substitutions that were part of exclusion criteria.\n\nIn DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either\ndoravirine 100 mg or darunavir + ritonavir 800+100 mg once daily, each in combination with \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the \ninvestigator. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 33 years (range 18 to 69 years), 86 % had \nCD4+ T cell count greater than 200 cells per mm3, 84 % were male, 27 % were non-white, 4 % had \nhepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10 % had a history of AIDS, 20 % had HIV-1 RNA greater \nthan 100,000 copies per mL, 13 % received ABC/3TC and 87 % received FTC/TDF; these \ncharacteristics were similar between treatment groups.\n\nIn DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil 100/300/245 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or \nefavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (EFV/FTC/TDF) once daily. At baseline, the median age \nof subjects was 31 years (range 18-70 years), 85 % were male, 52 % were non-white, 3% had hepatitis \nB or C co-infection, 14 % had a history of AIDS, 21 % had HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies per mL, and \n12 % had CD4+ T cell count < 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment \ngroups.\n\nWeek 48 and 96 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in Table 4.

Baseline CD4 cell count was carried forward for \n\nsubjects who discontinued assigned therapy due to lack of efficacy. \nNote: Both doravirine and efavirenz were administered with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (FTC/TDF).\n\nVirologically suppressed adult subjects\nThe efficacy of switching from a baseline regimen consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors in combination with a ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted PI, or cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, \nor an NNRTI to DOR/3TC/TDF was evaluated in a randomized, open-label trial (DRIVE-SHIFT), in \nvirologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.  Subjects must have been virologically suppressed \n(HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months prior to trial entry, with \nno history of virologic failure, and a documented absence of RT substitutions conferring resistance to \ndoravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir (see section Resistance).  Subjects were randomized to either \nswitch to DOR/3TC/TDF at baseline [N = 447, Immediate Switch Group (ISG)], or stay on their \nbaseline regimen until Week 24, at which point they switched to DOR/3TC/TDF [N = 223, Delayed \nSwitch Group (DSG)].  At baseline, the median age of subjects was 43 years, 16 % were female, \nand 24 % were non-white.\n\nIn the DRIVE-SHIFT trial, an immediate switch to DOR/3TC/TDF was demonstrated to be non-\ninferior at Week 48 compared to continuation of the baseline regimen at Week 24 as assessed by the \nproportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL.

See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nThe pharmacokinetics of doravirine were studied in healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected subjects. \nDoravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. Steady state \nwas generally achieved by Day 2 of once daily dosing, with accumulation ratios of 1.2 to 1.4 for \nAUC0-24, Cmax, and C24. Doravirine steady state pharmacokinetics following administration of 100 mg \nonce daily to HIV-1 infected subjects, based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis, are provided \nbelow.\n\nParameter\nGM (% CV)\n\nAUC0-24 \nμM hr\n\nCmax\nμM\n\nC24\nnM\n\nDoravirine \n100 mg \nonce daily\n\n37.8 (29) 2.26 (19) 930 (63)\n\nGM: Geometric mean, % CV: Geometric coefficient of variation\n\nFollowing oral dosing, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2 hours after dosing. Doravirine has \nan estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 64 % for the 100 mg tablet.\n\nEffect of food on oral absorption\nThe administration of a single doravirine tablet with a high-fat meal to healthy subjects resulted in a \n16 % and 36 % increase in doravirine AUC and C24, respectively, while Cmax was not significantly \naffected.\n\nDistribution\nBased on administration of an IV microdose, the volume of distribution of doravirine is 60.5 L. \nDoravirine is approximately 76 % bound to plasma proteins.\n\nBiotransformation\nBased on in vitro data, doravirine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A.\n\nElimination\nDoravirine has a terminal half-life (t1/2) of approximately 15 hours. Doravirine is primarily eliminated \nvia oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Biliary excretion of unchanged medicinal product\nmay contribute to the elimination of doravirine, but this elimination route is not expected to be \nsignificant. Excretion of unchanged medicinal product via urinary excretion is minor.\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal excretion of doravirine is minor. In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment \nto 8 subjects without renal impairment, the single dose exposure of doravirine was 31 % higher in \nsubjects with severe renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included \nsubjects with CrCl between 17 and 317 mL/min, renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect \non doravirine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere renal impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or in \npatients undergoing dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nDoravirine is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. There was no clinically relevant\ndifference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine in a study comparing 8 subjects with moderate \nhepatic impairment (classified as Child-Pugh score B primarily due to increased encephalopathy and \nascites scores) to 8 subjects without hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) (see section 4.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nElderly\nAlthough a limited number of subjects aged 65 years and over has been included (n=36), no clinically \nrelevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified in subjects at least \n65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age in a Phase 1 trial or in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis. No dose adjustment is required.\n\nGender\nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between men and women for \ndoravirine.\n\nRace\nNo clinically relevant racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified \nbased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of doravirine in healthy and HIV-1 infected subjects.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nReproductive toxicity\nReproduction studies with orally administered doravirine have been performed in rats and rabbits at \nexposures approximately 9 times (rats) and 8 times (rabbits) the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD) with no effects on embryo-foetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal \n(rats) development. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that doravirine is transferred to the \nfoetus through the placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations of up to 40 % (rabbits) and 52 % (rats) \nthat of maternal concentrations observed on gestation Day 20.\n\nDoravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration, with milk \nconcentrations approximately 1.5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations.\n\nCarcinogenesis\nLong-term oral carcinogenicity studies of doravirine in mice and rats showed no evidence of \ncarcinogenic potential at estimated exposures up to 6 times (mice) and 7 times (rats) the human \nexposures at the RHD.\n\nMutagenesis\nDoravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nThere were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when \ndoravirine was administered to rats up to 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.\n\n6.

It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called ‘antiretroviral medicines’.\n\nPifeltro contains the active substance doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor \n(NNRTI).\n\nWhat Pifeltro is used for\nPifeltro is used to treat HIV infection in people 18 years of age and older. HIV is the virus that causes \nAIDS (‘acquired immune deficiency syndrome’). You should not take Pifeltro if your doctor has told \nyou that the virus causing your infection is resistant to doravirine.\n\nPifeltro must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.\n\nHow Pifeltro works\nWhen used with other medicines, Pifeltro works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your \nbody. This will help by:\n reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your ‘viral load’)\n increasing the number of white blood cells called ‘CD4+ T’. This can make your immune \n\nsystem stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your \nimmune system is weak.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Pifeltro\n\nDo not take Pifeltro:\n\n if you are allergic to doravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \nsection 6.\n\n if you are taking the following medicines:\n carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizures)\n rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or \n\nproducts that contain it\nmitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)\n enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)\n lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)\n\nDo not take Pifeltro if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or \nnurse before taking Pifeltro. See also “Other Medicines and Pifeltro” section.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Pifeltro.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV is spread by contact with blood or through sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still\npass on HIV when taking Pifeltro, although effective therapy lowers the risk. Talk to your doctor \nabout what you can do to avoid infecting other people.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nThis can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including this medicine. Your immune \nsystem may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long \ntime. Tell your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV\nmedicine.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) \nmay also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune \ndisorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up \ntowards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor \nimmediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to anybody aged less than 18 years. The use of Pifeltro in people aged \nless than 18 years has not yet been studied.\n\nOther medicines and Pifeltro\nTell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Pifeltro works, and Pifeltro might affect \nthe way some other medicines work.\n\nThere are some medicines you must not take with Pifeltro. See list under “Do not take Pifeltro” \nsection.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Pifeltro, as your doctor may need to \nchange the dose of your medicines:\n\n bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)\n dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\n lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)\n modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)\n nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)\n rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)\n telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhoea in people with carcinoid syndrome)\n thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)\n\nIf your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Pifeltro, one tablet of doravirine should be \ntaken twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).\n\nYour doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following \nmedicines with Pifeltro:\n sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)\n tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk \nto your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Pifeltro. It is preferable to avoid the use of this \nmedicine during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if \nit will harm your baby while you are pregnant.\n\nWomen with HIV should not breast-feed because HIV can be passed on to their babies through breast \nmilk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nUse caution when driving or riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel dizzy, tired, or sleepy \nafter taking this medicine.\n\nPifeltro tablets contain lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before \ntaking this medicine.\n\n3.
