PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nColourless, pH 5.6 to 6.0 solution that may contain translucent to white, visible amorphous, \nproteinaceous panitumumab particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVectibix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal \ncancer (mCRC): \n\uf0b7 in first-line in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. \n\uf0b7 in second-line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line \n\nfluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan). \n\uf0b7 as monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing \n\nchemotherapy regimens. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nVectibix treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapy. \nEvidence of wild-type RAS (KRAS and NRAS) status is required before initiating treatment with \nVectibix. Mutational status should be determined by an experienced laboratory using validated test \nmethods for detection of KRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4) and NRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4) mutations. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg/kg of bodyweight given once every two weeks. \n \nModification of the dose of Vectibix may be necessary in cases of severe (\u2265 grade 3) dermatological \nreactions as follows: \n \n\nOccurrence of \nskin symptom(s):  \n\n\u2265 grade 31 \n\nAdministration \nof Vectibix \n\nOutcome Dose regulation \n\nInitial occurrence Withhold 1 or \n2 doses \n\nImproved (< grade 3) Continuing infusion \nat 100% of original dose\n\nNot recovered Discontinue \nAt the second \n\noccurrence \nWithhold 1 or \n\n2 doses \nImproved (< grade 3) Continuing infusion at 80% \n\nof original dose\nNot recovered Discontinue \n\nAt the third \noccurrence \n\nWithhold 1 or \n2 doses \n\nImproved (< grade 3) Continuing infusion at 60% \nof original dose\n\nNot recovered Discontinue \nAt the fourth \noccurrence \n\nDiscontinue - - \n\n1 Greater than or equal to grade 3 is defined as severe or life-threatening \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vectibix have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nThere is no clinical data to support dose adjustments in the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Vectibix in the paediatric population in the indication treatment of \ncolorectal cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nVectibix must be administered as an intravenous infusion via an infusion pump. \n \nPrior to infusion, Vectibix should be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection \nto a final concentration not to exceed 10 mg/mL (for preparation instructions see section 6.6). \n \nVectibix must be administered using a low protein binding 0.2 or 0.22 micrometre in-line filter, \nthrough a peripheral line or indwelling catheter. The recommended infusion time is approximately \n60 minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated, then subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 to \n60 minutes. Doses higher than 1,000 mg should be infused over approximately 90 minutes (for \nhandling instructions, see section 6.6). \n \nThe infusion line should be flushed with sodium chloride solution before and after Vectibix \nadministration to avoid mixing with other medicinal products or intravenous solutions. \n \nA reduction in the rate of infusion of Vectibix may be necessary in cases of infusion-related reactions \n(see section 4.4). \n \nVectibix must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nPatients with a history of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of \nthe excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis (see section 4.4). \n \nThe combination of Vectibix with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients \nwith mutant RAS mCRC or for whom RAS mCRC status is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nDermatologic reactions and soft tissue toxicity \n \nDermatologic related reactions, a pharmacologic effect observed with epidermal growth factor \nreceptor (EGFR) inhibitors, are experienced with nearly all patients (approximately 94%) treated with \nVectibix. Severe (NCI-CTC grade 3) skin reactions were reported in 23% and life-threatening \n(NCI-CTC grade 4) skin reactions in < 1% of patients who received Vectibix monotherapy and in \ncombination with chemotherapy (n = 2,224) (see section 4.8). If a patient develops dermatologic \nreactions that are grade 3 (CTCAE v 4.0) or higher, or that are considered intolerable, see the \nrecommendation for dose modification in section 4.2. \n \nIn clinical studies, subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic reactions (including \nstomatitis), infectious complications including sepsis and necrotising fasciitis, in rare cases leading to \ndeath, and local abscesses requiring incisions and drainage were reported. Patients who have severe \ndermatologic reactions or soft tissue toxicity or who develop worsening reactions whilst receiving \nVectibix should be monitored for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae (including \ncellulitis and necrotising fasciitis), and appropriate treatment promptly initiated. Life-threatening and \nfatal infectious complications including necrotising fasciitis and sepsis have been observed in patients \ntreated with Vectibix. Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have \nbeen reported in patients treated with Vectibix in the post-marketing setting. Withhold or discontinue \nVectibix in the event of dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening \ninflammatory or infectious complications. \n \nTreatment and management of dermatologic reactions should be based on severity and may include a \nmoisturiser, sun screen (SPF > 15 UVA and UVB), and topical steroid cream (not stronger than 1% \nhydrocortisone) applied to affected areas, and/or oral antibiotics (e.g. doxycycline). It is also \nrecommended that patients experiencing rash/dermatological toxicities wear sunscreen and hats and \nlimit sun exposure as sunlight can exacerbate any skin reactions that may occur. Patients may be \nadvised to apply moisturiser and sunscreen to face, hands, feet, neck, back and chest every morning \nduring treatment, and to apply the topical steroid to face, hands, feet, neck, back and chest every night \nduring treatment. \n \nPulmonary complications \n \nPatients with a history of, or evidence of, interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis were excluded \nfrom clinical studies. Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), both fatal and non-fatal, have been \nreported, mainly from the Japanese population. In the event of acute onset or worsening pulmonary \nsymptoms, Vectibix treatment should be interrupted and a prompt investigation of these symptoms \nshould occur. If ILD is diagnosed, Vectibix should be permanently discontinued and the patient should \nbe treated appropriately. In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the \n\n\n\n5 \n\nbenefits of therapy with panitumumab versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully \nconsidered. \n \nElectrolyte disturbances \n \nProgressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 4) hypomagnesaemia have \nbeen observed in some patients. Patients should be periodically monitored for hypomagnesaemia and \naccompanying hypocalcaemia prior to initiating Vectibix treatment, and periodically thereafter for up \nto 8 weeks after the completion of treatment (see section 4.8). Magnesium repletion is recommended, \nas appropriate. \n \nOther electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalaemia, have also been observed. Monitoring as above \nand repletion as appropriate of these electrolytes is also recommended. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nAcross monotherapy and combination mCRC clinical studies (n = 2,224), infusion-related reactions \n(occurring within 24 hours of an infusion) were reported in Vectibix-treated patients, including severe \ninfusion-related reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3 and grade 4). \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, serious infusion-related reactions have been reported, including rare \npost-marketing reports with a fatal outcome. If a severe or life-threatening reaction occurs during an \ninfusion or at any time post-infusion [e.g. presence of bronchospasm, angioedema, hypotension, need \nfor parenteral treatment, or anaphylaxis], Vectibix should be permanently discontinued (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients experiencing a mild or moderate (CTCAE v 4.0 grades 1 and 2) infusion-related reaction \nthe infusion rate should be reduced for the duration of that infusion. It is recommended to maintain \nthis lower infusion rate in all subsequent infusions. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after infusion have been reported including a \nfatal case of angioedema that occurred more than 24 hours after the infusion. Patients should be \ninformed of the possibility of a late onset reaction and instructed to contact their physician if \nsymptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction occur. \n \nAcute renal failure \n \nAcute renal failure has been observed in patients who develop severe diarrhoea and dehydration. \nPatients who experience severe diarrhoea should be instructed to consult a healthcare professional \nurgently. \n \nVectibix in combination with irinotecan, bolus 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL) chemotherapy \n \nPatients receiving Vectibix in combination with the IFL regimen [bolus 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), \nleucovorin (20 mg/m2) and irinotecan (125 mg/m2)] experienced a high incidence of severe diarrhoea \n(see section 4.8). Therefore administration of Vectibix in combination with IFL should be avoided (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nVectibix in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy regimens \n \nShortened progression-free survival time and increased deaths were observed in the patients receiving \nVectibix in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. A greater frequency of pulmonary \nembolism, infections (predominantly of dermatologic origin), diarrhoea, electrolyte imbalances, \nnausea, vomiting and dehydration was also observed in the treatment arms using Vectibix in \ncombination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Vectibix should not be administered in \ncombination with bevacizumab containing chemotherapy (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVectibix in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with mutant RAS mCRC or \nfor whom RAS tumour status is unknown \n \nThe combination of Vectibix with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients \nwith mutant RAS mCRC or for whom RAS mCRC status is unknown (see sections 4.3 and 5.1). \n \nA shortened progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) time were observed in patients \nwith mutant KRAS (exon 2) tumours and additional RAS mutations (KRAS [exons 3 and 4] or NRAS \n[exons 2, 3, 4]) who received panitumumab in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, \nand oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) versus FOLFOX alone (see section 5.1). \n \nRAS mutational status should be determined using a validated test method by an experienced \nlaboratory (see section 4.2). If Vectibix is to be used in combination with FOLFOX then it is \nrecommended that mutational status be determined by a laboratory that participates in a RAS External \nQuality Assurance programme or wild-type status be confirmed in a duplicate test. \n \nOcular toxicities \n \nSerious cases of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis have been rarely reported in the post-marketing \nsetting. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or \nworsening: eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye \nshould be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. \n \nIf a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with Vectibix should be interrupted or \ndiscontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be \ncarefully considered. \n \nVectibix should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or \nsevere dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration. \n \nPatients with ECOG 2 performance status treated with Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy \n \nFor patients with ECOG 2 performance status, assessment of benefit-risk is recommended prior to \ninitiation of Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of mCRC. A positive benefit-\nrisk balance has not been documented in patients with ECOG 2 performance status. \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) \ntreated with Vectibix monotherapy. However, an increased number of serious adverse reactions were \nreported in elderly patients treated with Vectibix in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX \nchemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (see section 4.8). \n \nWarnings for excipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 3.45 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.017% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData from an interaction study involving Vectibix and irinotecan in patients with mCRC indicated that \nthe pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, are not altered when the \nmedicinal products are co-administered. Results from a cross-study comparison indicated that \nirinotecan-containing regimens (IFL or FOLFIRI) have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npanitumumab. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nVectibix should not be administered in combination with IFL chemotherapy or with bevacizumab-\ncontaining chemotherapy. A high incidence of severe diarrhoea was observed when panitumumab was \nadministered in combination with IFL (see section 4.4), and increased toxicity and deaths were seen \nwhen panitumumab was combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe combination of Vectibix with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients \nwith mutant RAS mCRC or for whom RAS mCRC status is unknown. A shortened progression-free \nsurvival and overall survival time were observed in a clinical study in patients with mutant RAS \ntumours who received panitumumab and FOLFOX (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Vectibix in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. EGFR has \nbeen implicated in the control of prenatal development and may be essential for normal organogenesis, \nproliferation, and differentiation in the developing embryo. Therefore, Vectibix has the potential to \ncause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. \n \nHuman IgG is known to cross the placental barrier, and panitumumab may therefore be transmitted \nfrom the mother to the developing foetus. In women of childbearing potential, appropriate \ncontraceptive measures must be used during treatment with Vectibix, and for 2 months following the \nlast dose. If Vectibix is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this \nmedicinal product, she should be advised of the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy or potential \nhazard to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether panitumumab is excreted in human breast milk. Because human IgG is secreted \ninto human milk, panitumumab might also be secreted. The potential for absorption and harm to the \ninfant after ingestion is unknown. It is recommended that women do not breast-feed during treatment \nwith Vectibix and for 2 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies have shown reversible effects on the menstrual cycle and reduced female fertility in \nmonkeys (see section 5.3). Panitumumab may impact the ability of a woman to become pregnant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVectibix may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients experience \ntreatment-related symptoms affecting their vision and/or ability to concentrate and react, it is \nrecommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nBased on an analysis of all mCRC clinical trial patients receiving Vectibix monotherapy and in \ncombination with chemotherapy (n = 2,224), the most commonly reported adverse reactions are skin \nreactions occurring in approximately 94% of patients. These reactions are related to the pharmacologic \neffects of Vectibix, and the majority are mild to moderate in nature with 23% severe (grade 3 \nNCI-CTC) and < 1% life-threatening (grade 4 NCI-CTC). For clinical management of skin reactions, \nincluding dose modification recommendations, see section 4.4. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nVery commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 20% of patients were gastrointestinal \ndisorders [diarrhoea (46%), nausea (39%), vomiting (26%), constipation (23%) and abdominal pain \n(23%)]; general disorders [fatigue (35%), pyrexia (21%)]; metabolism and nutrition disorders \n[decreased appetite (30%)]; infections and infestations [paronychia (20%)]; and skin and subcutaneous \ndisorders [rash (47%), dermatitis acneiform (39%), pruritus (36%), erythema (33%) and dry skin \n(21%)]. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical studies in patients with \nmCRC who received panitumumab as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy (n = 2,224) \nand spontaneous reporting.

For these ADRs the maximum frequency category was estimated from the upper \nlimit of 95% confidence interval for the point estimate based on regulatory guidelines for estimation of the frequency of \nadverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. The maximum frequency estimated from the upper limit of 95% confidence \ninterval for the point estimate, i.e., 3/2,224 (or 0.13%). \n \nThe safety profile of Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy consisted of the reported adverse \nreactions of Vectibix (as a monotherapy) and the toxicities of the background chemotherapy regimen. \nNo new toxicities or worsening of previously recognised toxicities beyond the expected additive \neffects were observed. Skin reactions were the most frequently occurring adverse reactions in patients \nreceiving panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy. Other toxicities that were observed with a \ngreater frequency relative to monotherapy included hypomagnesaemia, diarrhoea, and stomatitis. \nThese toxicities infrequently led to discontinuation of Vectibix or of chemotherapy. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nDiarrhoea when reported was mainly mild or moderate in severity. Severe diarrhoea (NCI-CTC \ngrade 3 and 4) was reported in 2% of patients treated with Vectibix as a monotherapy and in 16% of \npatients treated with Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThere have been reports of acute renal failure in patients who develop diarrhoea and dehydration (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nAcross monotherapy and combination mCRC clinical studies (n = 2,224), infusion-related reactions \n(occurring within 24 hours of any infusion), which may include symptoms/signs such as chills, fever \nor dyspnoea, were reported in approximately 5% of Vectibix-treated patients, of which 1% were \nsevere (NCI-CTC grade 3 and grade 4). \n \nA case of fatal angioedema occurred in a patient with recurrent and metastatic squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck treated with Vectibix in a clinical trial. The fatal event occurred after \nre-exposure following a prior episode of angioedema; both episodes occurred greater than 24 hours \nafter administration (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than \n24 hours after infusion have also been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nFor clinical management of infusion-related reactions, see section 4.4. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nSkin rash most commonly occurred on the face, upper chest, and back, but could extend to the \nextremities. Subsequent to the development of severe skin and subcutaneous reactions, infectious \ncomplications including sepsis, in rare cases leading to death, cellulitis and local abscesses requiring \nincisions and drainage were reported. The median time to first symptom of dermatologic reaction was \n10 days, and the median time to resolution after the last dose of Vectibix was 31 days. \n \nParonychial inflammation was associated with swelling of the lateral nail folds of the toes and fingers. \n \nDermatological reactions (including nail effects), observed in patients treated with Vectibix or other \nEGFR inhibitors, are known to be associated with the pharmacologic effects of therapy. \n \nAcross all clinical trials, skin reactions occurred in approximately 94% of patients receiving Vectibix \nas monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy (n = 2,224). These events consisted \npredominantly of rash and dermatitis acneiform and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Severe \n(NCI-CTC grade 3) skin reactions were reported in 23% and life-threatening (NCI-CTC grade 4) skin \nreactions in < 1% of patients. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotising \nfasciitis and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix (see section 4.4). \n \nFor clinical management of dermatological reactions, including dose modification recommendations, \nsee section 4.4. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, rare cases of skin necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (see section 4.4) have been reported. \n \nOcular toxicities \n \nNon-serious cases of keratitis have been observed in 0.3% of clinical trial patients. In the \npost-marketing setting, serious cases of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis have been rarely reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nOther special populations \n \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) \ntreated with Vectibix monotherapy. However, an increased number of serious adverse events were \nreported in elderly patients treated with Vectibix in combination with FOLFIRI (45% versus 32%) or \nFOLFOX (52% versus 37%) chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (see section 4.4). The \nmost increased serious adverse events included diarrhoea in patients treated with Vectibix in \n\n\n\n11 \n\ncombination with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, and dehydration and pulmonary embolism when \npatients were treated with Vectibix in combination with FOLFIRI. \n \nThe safety of Vectibix has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 9 mg/kg have been tested in clinical trials. There have been reports of overdose at doses \nup to approximately twice the recommended therapeutic dose (12 mg/kg). Adverse events observed \nincluded skin toxicity, diarrhoea, dehydration and fatigue and were consistent with the safety profile at \nthe recommended dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPanitumumab is a recombinant, fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity \nand specificity to the human EGFR. EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of a \nsubfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR (HER1/c-ErbB-1), HER2, HER3, and \nHER4. EGFR promotes cell growth in normal epithelial tissues, including the skin and hair follicle, \nand is expressed on a variety of tumour cells. \n \nPanitumumab binds to the ligand binding domain of EGFR and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation \ninduced by all known EGFR ligands. Binding of panitumumab to EGFR results in internalisation of \nthe receptor, inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and decreased interleukin 8 and vascular \nendothelial growth factor production. \n \nKRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homologue) and NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS viral \noncogene homologue) are highly related members of the RAS oncogene family. KRAS and NRAS \ngenes encode small, GTP-binding proteins involved in signal transduction. A variety of stimuli, \nincluding that from the EGFR activate KRAS and NRAS which in turn stimulate other intracellular \nproteins to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and angiogenesis. \n \nActivating mutations in the RAS genes occur frequently in a variety of human tumours and have been \nimplicated in both oncogenesis and tumour progression. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn vitro assays and in vivo animal studies have shown that panitumumab inhibits the growth and \nsurvival of tumour cells expressing EGFR. No anti-tumour effects of panitumumab were observed in \nhuman tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression. The addition of panitumumab to radiation, \nchemotherapy or other targeted therapeutic agents, in animal studies resulted in an increase in anti-\ntumour effects compared to radiation, chemotherapy or targeted therapeutic agents alone. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nDermatological reactions (including nail effects), observed in patients treated with Vectibix or other \nEGFR inhibitors, are known to be associated with the pharmacologic effects of therapy (with cross-\nreference to sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Data on the development of \nanti-panitumumab antibodies has been evaluated using two different screening immunoassays for the \ndetection of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies (an ELISA which detects high-affinity antibodies, \nand a Biosensor Immunoassay which detects both high and low-affinity antibodies). For patients \nwhose sera tested positive in either screening immunoassay, an in vitro biological assay was \nperformed to detect neutralising antibodies. \n \nAs monotherapy: \n\uf0b7 The incidence of binding antibodies (excluding predose and transient positive patients) was \n\n< 1% as detected by the acid-dissociation ELISA and 3.8% as detected by the Biacore assay; \n\uf0b7 The incidence of neutralising antibodies (excluding predose and transient positive patients) \n\nwas < 1%; \n\uf0b7 Compared with patients who did not develop antibodies, no relationship between the presence \n\nof anti-panitumumab antibodies and pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety has been observed. \nIn combination with irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy: \n\uf0b7 The incidence of binding antibodies (excluding predose positive patients) was 1% as detected \n\nby the acid-dissociation ELISA and < 1% as detected by the Biacore assay; \n\uf0b7 The incidence of neutralising antibodies (excluding predose positive patients) was < 1%; \n\uf0b7 No evidence of an altered safety profile was found in patients who tested positive for antibodies \n\nto Vectibix. \n \nThe detection of antibody formation is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The \nobserved incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including \nassay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicinal products \nand underlying disease, therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to other products may be \nmisleading. \n \nClinical efficacy as monotherapy \n \nThe efficacy of Vectibix as monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who \nhad disease progression during or after prior chemotherapy was studied in open-label, single-arm trials \n(585 patients) and in two randomised controlled trials versus best supportive care (463 patients) and \nversus cetuximab (1,010 patients). \n \nA multinational, randomised, controlled trial was conducted in 463 patients with EGFR-expressing \nmetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum after confirmed failure of oxaliplatin and irinotecan-\ncontaining regimens. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive Vectibix at a dose of 6 mg/kg given \nonce every two weeks plus best supportive care (not including chemotherapy) (BSC) or BSC alone. \nPatients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Upon disease \nprogression BSC alone patients were eligible to crossover to a companion study and receive Vectibix \nat a dose of 6 mg/kg given once every two weeks. \n \nThe primary endpoint was PFS. The study was retrospectively analysed by wild-type KRAS (exon 2) \nstatus versus mutant KRAS (exon 2) status. Tumour samples obtained from the primary resection of \ncolorectal cancer were analysed for the presence of the seven most common activating mutations in \nthe codon 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. 427 (92%) patients were evaluable for KRAS status of which \n184 had mutations. The efficacy results from an analysis adjusting for potential bias from unscheduled \nassessments are shown in the table below. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) seen in \neither group. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n Wild-type KRAS (exon 2) \npopulation\n\nMutant KRAS (exon 2) \npopulation \n\n Vectibix plus \nBSC \n\n(n = 124)\n\nBSC \n(n = 119) \n\nVectibix plus \nBSC \n\n(n = 84) \n\nBSC \n(n = 100) \n\nORR n (%) 17% 0% 0% 0%\nResponse rate (investigator \nassessed)a (95% CI) \n\n22% \n(14, 32)\n\n0% \n(0, 4) \n\nStable Disease 34% 12% 12% 8%\nPFS \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.49 (0.37,0.65), p < 0.0001 1.07 (0.77,1.48), p = 0.6880\nMedian (weeks) 16.0 8.0 8.0 8.0\nCI = confidence interval \na In patients that crossed over to panitumumab after progression on BSC alone (95% CI) \n \nIn an exploratory analysis of banked tumour specimens from this study, 11 of 72 patients (15%) with \nwild-type RAS tumours receiving panitumumab had an objective response compared to only 1 of \n95 patients (1%) with mutant RAS tumour status. Moreover, panitumumab treatment was associated \nwith improved PFS compared to BSC in patients with wild-type RAS tumours (HR = 0.38 \n[95% CI: 0.27, 0.56]), but not in patients with tumours harbouring a RAS mutation (HR = 0.98 \n[95% CI: 0.73, 1.31]). \n \nThe efficacy of Vectibix was also evaluated in an open-label trial in patients with wild-type KRAS \n(exon 2) mCRC. A total of 1,010 patients refractory to chemotherapy were randomised 1:1 to receive \nVectibix or cetuximab to test whether Vectibix is non-inferior to cetuximab. The primary endpoint \nwas OS. Secondary endpoints included PFS and objective response rate (ORR). \n \nThe efficacy results for the study are presented in the table below. \n \n\nWild-type KRAS (exon 2) \npopulation \n\nVectibix \n(n = 499) \n\nCetuximab \n(n = 500) \n\nOS \nMedian (months) (95% CI) 10.4 (9.4, 11.6) 10.0 (9.3, 11.0) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.97 (0.84, 1.11) \nPFS \nMedian (months) (95% CI) 4.1 (3.2, 4.8) 4.4 (3.2, 4.8) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 1.00 (0.88, 1.14) \nORR \nn (%) (95% CI) 22% (18%, 26%) 20% (16%, 24%) \nOdds ratio (95% CI) 1.15 (0.83, 1.58) \n \nOverall, the safety profile of panitumumab was similar to that of cetuximab, in particular regarding \nskin toxicity. However, infusion reactions were more frequent with cetuximab (13% versus 3%) but \nelectrolyte disturbances were more frequent with panitumumab, especially hypomagnesaemia \n(29% versus 19%). \n \nClinical efficacy in combination with chemotherapy \n \nAmong patients with wild-type RAS mCRC, PFS, OS, and ORR were improved for subjects receiving \npanitumumab plus chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) compared with those receiving \nchemotherapy alone. Patients with additional RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 were unlikely to \nbenefit from the addition of panitumumab to FOLFIRI and a detrimental effect was seen with the \naddition of panitumumab to FOLFOX in these patients. BRAF mutations in exon 15 were found to be \nprognostic of worse outcome. BRAF mutations were not predictive of the outcome for panitumumab \ntreatment in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nFirst-line combination with FOLFOX \n \nThe efficacy of Vectibix in combination with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin \n(FOLFOX) was evaluated in a randomised, controlled trial of 1,183 patients with mCRC with the \nprimary endpoint of PFS. Other key endpoints included the OS, ORR, time to response, time to \nprogression (TTP), and duration of response. The study was prospectively analysed by tumour KRAS \n(exon 2) status which was evaluable in 93% of the patients. \n \nA predefined retrospective subset analysis of 641 patients of the 656 patients with wild-type KRAS \n(exon 2) mCRC was performed. Patient tumour samples with wild-type KRAS exon 2 (codons 12/13) \nstatus were tested for additional RAS mutations in KRAS exon 3 (codons 61) and exon 4 \n(codons 117/146) and NRAS exon 2 (codons 12/13), exon 3 (codon 61), and exon 4 (codons 117/146) \nand BRAF exon 15 (codon 600). The incidence of these additional RAS mutations in the wild-type \nKRAS exon 2 population was approximately 16%. \n \nResults in patients with wild-type RAS mCRC and mutant RAS mCRC are presented in the table \nbelow. \n \n Vectibix plus \n\nFOLFOX \n(months) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n\nFOLFOX  \n(months) \n\nMedian (95% CI) \n\nDifference \n(months) \n\nHazard ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\nWild-type RAS population \nPFS 10.1 \n\n(9.3, 12.0) \n7.9 \n\n(7.2, 9.3)\n2.2 0.72 \n\n(0.58, 0.90)\nOS 26.0 \n\n(21.7, 30.4) \n20.2 \n\n(17.7, 23.1)\n5.8 0.78 \n\n(0.62, 0.99)\nMutant RAS population \nPFS 7.3 \n\n(6.3, 7.9) \n8.7 \n\n(7.6, 9.4)\n-1.4 1.31 \n\n(1.07, 1.60)\nOS 15.6 \n\n(13.4, 17.9) \n19.2 \n\n(16.7, 21.8)\n-3.6 1.25 \n\n(1.02, 1.55)\n \nAdditional mutations in KRAS and NRAS at exon 3 (codon 59) were subsequently identified (n = 7). \nAn exploratory analysis showed similar results to those in the previous table. \n \nCombination with FOLFIRI \n \nThe efficacy of Vectibix in second-line in combination with irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and \nleucovorin (FOLFIRI) was evaluated in a randomised, controlled trial of 1,186 patients with mCRC \nwith the primary endpoints of OS and PFS. Other key endpoints included the ORR, time to response, \nTTP, and duration of response. The study was prospectively analysed by tumour KRAS (exon 2) status \nwhich was evaluable in 91% of the patients. \n \nA predefined retrospective subset analysis of 586 patients of the 597 patients with wild-type KRAS \n(exon 2) mCRC was performed, where tumour samples from these patients were tested for additional \nRAS and BRAF mutations as previously described. The RAS/BRAF ascertainment was 85% (1,014 of \n1,186 randomised patients). The incidence of these additional RAS mutations (KRAS exons 3, 4 and \nNRAS exons 2, 3, 4) in the wild-type KRAS (exon 2) population was approximately 19%.

In the final analysis, the \nhazard ratio for PFS was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.52). Median PFS was 10.0 (95% CI: 8.9, 11.0) and \n11.4 (95% CI: 10.5, 11.9) months in the panitumumab and the non-panitumumab arm, respectively. \nThere was an increase in mortality in the panitumumab arm. The hazard ratio for overall survival \nwas 1.43 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.83). Median overall survival was 19.4 (95% CI: 18.4, 20.8) and 24.5 \n(95% CI: 20.4, 24.5) in the panitumumab arm and the non-panitumumab arm. \n \nAn additional analysis of efficacy data by KRAS (exon 2) status did not identify a subset of patients \nwho benefited from panitumumab in combination with oxaliplatin- or irinotecan based chemotherapy \nand bevacizumab. For the wild-type KRAS subset of the oxaliplatin cohort, the hazard ratio for PFS \n\n\n\n16 \n\nwas 1.36 with 95% CI: 1.04-1.77. For the mutant KRAS subset, the hazard ratio for PFS was 1.25 with \n95% CI: 0.91-1.71. A trend for OS favouring the control arm was observed in the wild-type KRAS \nsubset of the oxaliplatin cohort (hazard ratio = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.75). A trend towards worse \nsurvival was also observed with panitumumab in the irinotecan cohort regardless of KRAS mutational \nstatus. Overall, panitumumab treatment combined with chemotherapy and bevacizumab is associated \nwith an unfavourable benefit-to-risk profile irrespective of tumour KRAS mutational status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVectibix in all subsets of the paediatric population in colorectal cancer (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nVectibix administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy exhibits nonlinear \npharmacokinetics. \n \nFollowing a single-dose administration of panitumumab as a 1-hour infusion, the area under the \nconcentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and clearance \n(CL) of panitumumab decreased from 30.6 to 4.6 mL/day/kg as the dose increased from 0.75 to \n9 mg/kg. However, at doses above 2 mg/kg, the AUC of panitumumab increases in an approximately \ndose-proportional manner. \n \nFollowing the recommended dose regimen (6 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks as a 1-hour infusion), \npanitumumab concentrations reached steady-state levels by the third infusion with mean (\u00b1 Standard \nDeviation [SD]) peak and trough concentrations of 213 \u00b1 59 and 39 \u00b1 14 mcg/mL, respectively. The \nmean (\u00b1 SD) AUC0-tau and CL were 1,306 \u00b1 374 mcg\u2022day/mL and 4.9 \u00b1 1.4 mL/kg/day, respectively. \nThe elimination half-life was approximately 7.5 days (range: 3.6 to 10.9 days). \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to explore the potential effects of selected \ncovariates on panitumumab pharmacokinetics. Results suggest that age (21-88), gender, race, hepatic \nfunction, renal function, chemotherapeutic agents, and EGFR membrane staining intensity (1+, 2+, \n3+) in tumour cells had no apparent impact on the pharmacokinetics of panitumumab. \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of panitumumab in patients \nwith renal or hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with \npossible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nSkin rash and diarrhoea were the major findings observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to \n26 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings were observed at doses approximately \nequivalent to the recommended human dose and were reversible upon termination of administration of \npanitumumab. The skin rash and diarrhoea observed in monkeys are considered related to the \npharmacological action of panitumumab and are consistent with the toxicities observed with other \nanti-EGFR inhibitors. \n \nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of panitumumab have not been \nperformed. \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development since foetal panitumumab \nexposure levels were not examined. Panitumumab has been shown to cause foetal abortions and/or \nfoetal deaths in cynomolgus monkeys when administered during the period of organogenesis at doses \napproximately equivalent to the recommended human dose. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nFormal male fertility studies have not been conducted; however, microscopic evaluation of male \nreproductive organs from repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \napproximately 5-fold the human dose on a mg/kg basis, revealed no differences compared to control \nmale monkeys. Fertility studies conducted in female cynomolgus monkeys showed that panitumumab \nmay produce prolonged menstrual cycle and/or amenorrhea and reduced pregnancy rate which \noccurred at all doses evaluated. \n \nNo pre- and post-natal development animal studies have been conducted with panitumumab. All \npatients should be advised regarding the potential risk of panitumumab on pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment prior to initiation of Vectibix therapy. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vectibix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Vectibix \n3. How to use Vectibix \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vectibix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vectibix is and what it is used for \n \nVectibix is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (cancer of the bowel) for adult patients \nwith a certain type of tumour known as a \u201cWild-type RAS tumour\u201d. Vectibix is used alone or in \ncombination with other anti-cancer medicines. \n \nVectibix contains the active substance panitumumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nmonoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins, which specifically recognise and attach \n(bind) to other unique proteins in the body. \n \nPanitumumab recognises and binds specifically to a protein known as epidermal growth factor \nreceptor (EGFR), which is found on the surface of some cancer cells. When growth factors (other \nbody proteins) attach to the EGFR, the cancer cell is stimulated to grow and divide. Panitumumab \nbinds onto the EGFR and prevents the cancer cell from receiving the messages it needs for growth and \ndivision. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Vectibix \n \nDo not use Vectibix: \n \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to panitumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 if you have previously had or have evidence of interstitial pneumonitis (swelling of the lungs \n\ncausing coughing and difficulty breathing) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring and thickening in the \nlungs with shortness of breath). \n\n\uf0b7 in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, if your RAS test shows that you have \nmutant RAS tumour, or if your RAS tumour status is unknown. Please consult your doctor if you \nare unsure of your RAS tumour status. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou may experience skin reactions or severe swelling and tissue damage, if these worsen or become \nintolerable please tell your doctor or nurse immediately. If you experience a severe skin reaction, your \ndoctor may recommend an adjustment of the dose of Vectibix. If you develop a severe infection or \nfever as a result of skin reactions, your doctor may stop your treatment with Vectibix. \n \nIt is recommended that you limit sun exposure whilst receiving Vectibix and if you are experiencing \nskin reactions as sunlight can worsen these. Wear sunscreen and a hat if you are going to be exposed \nto sunlight. Your doctor may ask you to use a moisturiser, sun screen (SPF > 15), topical steroid, \nand/or oral antibiotics which may help in the management of skin toxicities that can be associated with \nthe use of Vectibix. \n \nYour doctor will check your blood levels of several substances such as magnesium, calcium and \npotassium in your blood before you start Vectibix treatment. Your doctor will also check your blood \nlevels of magnesium and calcium periodically during your treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after you \nhave finished your treatment. If these levels are too low, your doctor may prescribe you appropriate \nsupplements. \n \nIf you experience severe diarrhoea please tell your doctor or nurse since you may lose a lot of water \nfrom your body (become dehydrated) and this could damage your kidneys. \n \nTell your doctor if you use contact lenses and/or have a history of eye problems such as severe dry \neye, inflammation of the front part of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the front part of the eye. \n \nIf you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred vision \nand/or sensitivity to light, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately as you may need urgent \ntreatment (see \u201cPossible side effects\u201d below). \n \nBased on your age (older than 65 years) or general health, your doctor will discuss with you your \nability to tolerate taking Vectibix with your chemotherapy treatment. \n \nOther medicines and Vectibix \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nVectibix should not be used in combination with bevacizumab (another monoclonal antibody used in \ncancer of the bowel) or with a chemotherapy combination known as \u201cIFL\u201d. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nVectibix has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant; \nthink you may be pregnant; or plan to get pregnant. Vectibix could affect your unborn baby or ability \nto stay pregnant. \n \nIf you are a woman of child bearing potential, you should use effective methods of contraception \nduring treatment with Vectibix and for 2 months after the last dose. \n \nIt is not recommended to breast-feed your baby during treatment with Vectibix and for 2 months after \nthe last dose. It is important to tell your doctor if you plan to breast-feed. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nYou should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects may impair \nyour ability to do so safely. \n \nVectibix contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains 3.45 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each mL unit. This \nis equivalent to 0.017% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How to use Vectibix \n \nVectibix will be administered in a healthcare facility under the supervision of a doctor experienced in \nthe use of anti-cancer medicines. \n \nVectibix is administered intravenously (into a vein) with an infusion pump (a device that gives a slow \ninjection). \n \nThe recommended dose of Vectibix is 6 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram of body weight) given once \nevery two weeks. The treatment will usually be given over a period of approximately 60 minutes. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effects and main side effects for Vectibix are listed below: \n \nInfusion reactions \n \nDuring or following treatment you may experience an infusion reaction. These can be mild or \nmoderate (likely to occur in approximately 5 out of 100 people who take Vectibix), or severe (likely to \noccur in 1 out of 100 people who take Vectibix). Symptoms may include headache, rashes, itching or \nhives, flushing, swelling (face, lips, mouth, around the eyes, and throat area), rapid and irregular \nheartbeat, fast pulse, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or a \ndecrease in blood pressure that may be severe or life-threatening and, very rarely, may lead to death. If \nyou experience any of these symptoms, you should notify your doctor immediately. Your doctor may \ndecide to reduce the rate of your infusion or discontinue your treatment with Vectibix. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nVery rarely, serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions involving symptoms similar to an infusion \nreaction (see \u201cInfusion reactions\u201d) have occurred more than 24 hours after treatment and resulted in a \nfatal outcome. Seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction \nto Vectibix, including but not limited to difficulty breathing, chest tightness, a sensation of choking, \ndizziness, or fainting. \n \nSkin reactions \n \nSkin-related reactions are likely to occur in approximately 94 out of 100 people who take Vectibix and \nare usually mild to moderate. The skin rash commonly resembles acne and often involves the face, \nupper chest and back, but can affect any area of the body. Some rashes have been associated with \nredness, itching and flaking of the skin which can become severe. In some cases, it may cause infected \nsores requiring medical and/or surgical treatment, or cause severe skin infections that in rare cases \ncould be fatal. In rare cases patients may experience blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals, \nwhich may indicate a severe skin reaction called \u201cStevens-Johnson syndrome\u201d or blistering of the \n\n\n\n31 \n\nskin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called \u201ctoxic epidermal necrolysis\u201d. If you experience \nblistering, you should notify your doctor immediately. Prolonged exposure to the sun can make the \nrash worse. Also, dry skin, fissures (cracks in the skin) on the fingers or toes, fingernail bed or toenail \nbed infection (paronychia) or inflammation has been reported. Once treatment is withheld or \ndiscontinued, the skin reactions will generally resolve. Your doctor may decide to treat the rash, adjust \nthe dose or discontinue your treatment with Vectibix. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 low red blood cell numbers (anaemia); low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalaemia); low \n\nmagnesium levels in the blood (hypomagnesaemia); \n\uf0b7 eye inflammation (conjunctivitis); \n\uf0b7 local or widespread rash which may be bumpy (with or without spots), itchy, red or flaky; \n\uf0b7 hair loss (alopecia); mouth ulcers and cold sores (stomatitis); inflammation of the mouth \n\n(mucosal inflammation); \n\uf0b7 diarrhoea; nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; constipation; decreased appetite; decreased \n\nweight; \n\uf0b7 extreme tiredness (fatigue); fever or high temperature (pyrexia); lack or loss of strength \n\n(asthenia); accumulation of fluid in the extremities (oedema peripheral); \n\uf0b7 back pain; \n\uf0b7 inability to sleep (insomnia); \n\uf0b7 cough; dyspnoea (breathing difficulties). \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\uf0b7 low white blood numbers (leucopenia); low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcaemia); low \n\nphosphates in the blood (hypophosphataemia); high glucose in the blood (hyperglycaemia); \n\uf0b7 growth of eyelashes; flow of tears (lacrimation increased); redness of the eye (ocular \n\nhyperaemia); dry eye; itchy eyes (eye pruritus); eye irritation; eyelid inflammation (blepharitis); \n\uf0b7 skin ulcer; scab; excess hair growth (hypertrichosis); redness and swelling of palms of hands or \n\nsoles of feet (hand-foot syndrome); excess sweating (hyperhidrosis); skin reaction (dermatitis); \n\uf0b7 spreading infection below the skin (cellulitis); hair follicle inflammation (folliculitis); localised \n\ninfection; skin rash with pus-filled blisters (rash pustular); urinary tract infection; \n\uf0b7 nail disorder; breaking of the nails (onychoclasis); \n\uf0b7 dehydration; \n\uf0b7 dry mouth; indigestion (dyspepsia); rectal bleeding (rectal haemorrhage); lip inflammation \n\n(cheilitis); heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux); \n\uf0b7 chest pain; pain; chills; pain in the extremity; immune reaction (hypersensitivity); rapid heart \n\nrate (tachycardia); \n\uf0b7 blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) the symptoms of which may be sudden onset of \n\nshortness of breath or chest pain; nose bleed (epistaxis); blood clot in a deep vein (deep vein \nthrombosis); high blood pressure (hypertension); flushing; \n\n\uf0b7 headache; dizziness; anxiety. \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\uf0b7 blue colouration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); \n\uf0b7 ulcerative keratitis (a serious condition of ulceration of the front part of the eye (cornea) \n\nrequiring urgent treatment); \n\uf0b7 keratitis (inflammation of the front part of the eye (cornea)); \n\uf0b7 skin cell death (skin necrosis); \n\uf0b7 severe skin reaction with blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals (Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome); \n\uf0b7 severe skin reaction with blistering of the skin (toxic epidermal necrolysis); \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\uf0b7 eyelid irritation; chapped lips and/or dry lips; eye infection; eyelid infection; nasal dryness; \nloosening of the nails (onycholysis); ingrowing nail; excessive hair growth (hirsutism); \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease). \n \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

substances such as magnesium, calcium and potassium in your blood before you start vectibix treatment. your doctor will also check your blood levels of magnesium and calcium periodically during your treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after you have finished your treatment. if these levels are too low, your doctor may prescribe you appropriate supplements. if you experience severe diarrhoea please tell your doctor or nurse since you may lose a lot of water from your body (become dehydrated) and this could damage your kidneys. tell your doctor if you use contact lenses and/or have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eye, inflammation of the front part of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the front part of the eye. if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred vision and/or sensitivity to light, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately as you may need urgent treatment (see \"possible side effects\" below). based on your

"Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. the most serious side effects and main side effects for vectibix are listed below: infusion reactions during or following treatment you may experience an infusion reaction. these can be mild or moderate (likely to occur in approximately 5 out of 100 people who take vectibix), or severe (likely to occur in 1 out of 100 people who take vectibix). symptoms may include headache, rashes, itching or hives, flushing, swelling (face, lips, mouth, around the eyes, and throat area), rapid and irregular heartbeat, fast pulse, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or a decrease in blood pressure that may be severe or life-threatening and, very rarely, may lead to death. if you experience any of these symptoms, you should notify your doctor immediately. your doctor may decide to reduce the rate of your infusion or discontinue your treatment with vectibix. allergic reactions very rarely, serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions involving symptoms similar to an infusion reaction (see \"infusion reactions\") have occurred more than 24 hours after treatment and resulted in a fatal outcome. seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction to vectibix, including but not limited to difficulty breathing, chest tightness, a sensation of choking, dizziness, or fainting. skin reactions skin-related reactions are likely to occur in approximately 94 out of 100 people who take vectibix and are usually mild to moderate. the skin rash commonly resembles acne and often involves the face, upper chest and back, but can affect any area of the body. some rashes have been associated with redness, itching and flaking of the skin which can become severe. in some cases, it may cause infected sores requiring medical and/or surgical treatment, or cause severe skin infections that in rare cases could be fatal. in rare cases patients may experience blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called \"stevens-johnson syndrome\" or blistering of the 31 skin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called \"toxic epidermal necrolysis\". if you experience blistering, you should notify your doctor immediately. prolonged exposure to the sun can make the rash worse. also, dry skin, fissures (cracks in the skin) on the fingers or toes, fingernail bed or toenail bed infection (paronychia) or inflammation has been reported. once treatment is withheld or discontinued, the skin reactions will generally resolve. your doctor may decide to treat the rash, adjust the dose or discontinue your treatment with vectibix. other side effects include: very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people low red blood cell numbers (anaemia); low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalaemia); low magnesium levels in the blood (hypomagnesaemia); eye
