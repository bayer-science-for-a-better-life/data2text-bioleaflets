CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 \nyears and older. \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I \nDisorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic \nepisodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in \nBipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia: the recommended starting dose for Aripiprazole Sandoz is 10 or 15 mg/day with a \nmaintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than \na daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher \ndose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for Aripiprazole Sandoz is 15 mg \nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see \nsection 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed \n30 mg. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic episodes \nin patients who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, continue therapy at \nthe same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of \nclinical status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for Aripiprazole Sandoz is \n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be initiated at \n2 mg (using an appropriate aripiprazole containing medicinal product) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 \nadditional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see section \n5.1). Aripiprazole Sandoz is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher \nthan a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher \ndose. \nAripiprazole Sandoz is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose for \nAripiprazole Sandoz is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using an appropriate aripiprazole containing medicinal product) for 2 days, \ntitrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration \nshould be the minimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at \ndoses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore only be \nused in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). Younger patients \nare at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. Therefore, Aripiprazole \nSandoz is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole Sandoz in children and \nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in \nsection 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nTics associated with Tourette’s disorder: the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole Sandoz in children and \nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in \nsection 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In these patients \ndosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with \ncaution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole Sandoz in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in \nBipolar I Disorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater \nsensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nGender \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \n \nSmoking status \nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the \naripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the \ncombination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose \nshould be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole \ndose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz is for oral use. \n \nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to Aripiprazole Sandoz tablets for \npatients who have difficulty swallowing Aripiprazole Sandoz tablets (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to \nsome weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases \nhas been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including treatment with \naripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic \ntreatment.  \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular \ndisease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and \ntreatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant. \nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. Since \npatients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors \nfor VTE should be identified before and during treatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures \nundertaken. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. Aripiprazole \nshould be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see section 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia \nduring treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on \naripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These symptoms can \ntemporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nOther extrapyramidal symptoms \n \nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and symptoms \nof other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical monitoring should be \nconsidered. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare cases of \nNMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, \nmuscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood \npressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine \nphosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. However, elevated creatine \nphosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported. If a \npatient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without \nadditional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Therefore, \naripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions \nassociated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n=938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly \npatients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at \nincreased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% \ncompared to 1.7% in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths \nappeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature \n(see section 4.8). \n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-\ntreated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients \nin these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose \ntrial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients \ntreated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, \nhas been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk factors that \nmay predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes. In clinical \ntrials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related \nadverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo. \nPrecise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole and \n\n\n\n7 \n\nwith other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow direct comparisons. Patients treated with any \nantipsychotic, including aripiprazole, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such \nas polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for \ndiabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section \n4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use of \nantipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. When \nseen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or \npituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain \nin adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar mania, aripiprazole has been \nshown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. Weight gain should be monitored in \nadolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically significant, dose reduction should be \nconsidered (see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges \nwhile taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge \nor compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important for prescribers to ask \npatients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual \nurges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with \naripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying \ndisorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the \nmedication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result in harm to the patient and others if not \nrecognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking \naripiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \n \nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be taken when \nthese medicinal products are co-administered. \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazol may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to \nfalls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose should be \nconsidered (e.g elderly or debilitated patients) (see section 4.2). \n \nLactose \n \nAripiprazole Sandoz tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is administered in \ncombination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse reactions such as \nsedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT prolongation or \nelectrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \n \nA gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is \ndeemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers. \n \nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC \nby 107%, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, \ndecreased by 32% and 47%, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of \nits prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong \ninhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar \ndose reductions should therefore be applied. \n \nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole \nAUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% \nand 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may \nresult in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. \nWhen considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with \naripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant \nadministration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and \nHIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore \nbe applied (see section 4.2). Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of \naripiprazole should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak \ninhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with \naripiprazole, modest increases in plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral aripiprazole \nto patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for \naripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was \nadministered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after \ncarbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment \nwith aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of \naripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole and other inducers of \nCYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St. \nJohn's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied. \nUpon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of aripiprazole should be reduced to the \nrecommended dose. \n \nValproate and lithium \n\n\n\n9 \n\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically \nsignificant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary when either \nvalproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \n \nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 \n(omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not \nshow potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause \nclinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes. \n \nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there was \nno clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase aripiprazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital anomalies \nhave been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. Animal studies \ncould not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be advised to notify their \nphysician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole. Due to \ninsufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal \nproduct should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of pregnancy \nare at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in \nseverity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, \nsomnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn infants should be monitored \ncarefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea each \noccurring in more than 3% of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are tabulated \nbelow. The table is based on adverse events reported during clinical trials and/or post-marketing use.  \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they are \nderived from spontaneous reports.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was \n19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients. In another long-term 26-week \ncontrolled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-\ntreated patients.  \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for \naripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, the \nincidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium. \nIn the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% \nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients. \n \nAkathisia \nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and \n3.2% with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% \nwith placebo. \n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck \nmuscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or \nprotrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with \ngreater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic medicinal products. \nAn elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nLaboratory parameters \nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who \nreceived placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with schizophrenia, \nthe frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for the following reactions \nthat were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than in adults receiving aripiprazole \n(and more frequently than placebo):  \nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (≥ 1/10), and dry mouth, \nincreased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10).The safety profile \nin a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled \ntrial. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10). \n \nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, incidence of \nlow serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 29.5% and 48.3%, respectively. \nIn the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole exposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 \nmonths, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 25.6% and \n45.0%, respectively. \nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 37.0 % \nand 59.4 %, respectively. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to those in \nadults except for the following reactions: very commonly (≥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0%), extrapyramidal \ndisorder (18.4%), akathisia (16.0%), and fatigue (11.8%); and commonly (≥ 1/100, < 1/10) abdominal pain \nupper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle twitching, and dyskinesia. \n \nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1%, 30 mg, 28.8%, placebo, 1.7%,); and akathisia (incidences were 10 mg, 12.1%, \n30 mg, 20.3%, placebo, 1.7%). \n \nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for aripiprazole \nwere 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \n \nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with bipolar \ndisorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \n \nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low serum \nprolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) was 28.0% and 53.3%, respectively. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can occur in \npatients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of aripiprazole alone \nwas identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities. The \npotentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, \nsomnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, reports of accidental overdose with \naripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities. The potentially medically \nserious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and \nextrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal product \ninvolvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and \nshould include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. Following any \nconfirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should \ncontinue until the patient recovers. \n \nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about \n41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, \nhaemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma \nproteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole’s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through \na combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1a receptors and antagonism of \nserotonin 5-HT2a receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited \nhigh binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1a and 5-HT2a receptors and moderate \naffinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2c and 5-HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. \nAripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable \naffinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may \nexplain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate \nand putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia \nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult patients, \npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly \ngreater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \n \nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of \nresponder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups \n(aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%). The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on \naripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%). Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, \nincluding PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement \nover haloperidol. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had \nsignificantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a 26- week, \nolanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 adult patients \nand where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over \nbaseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n= 18, or 13% \nof evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients). \n \nLipid parameters \nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole has not \nbeen shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and \nLDL. \n \nProlactin \nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n=28,242). The incidence of \nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3%) was similar to \nthat of placebo (0.2%). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was 42 days and median \nduration was 34 days. \n \nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole was \n0.4%, compared with 0.02% for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median \ntime to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of \nmanic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or \nwithout a rapid-cycling course. \n \nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed \nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \n \nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode \nof Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to \nplacebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12. Aripiprazole \nalso demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or \nhaloperidol at week 12. \n \nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, \nwith or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy \nfor 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior \nefficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy. \n \nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved \nremission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole demonstrated \nsuperiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but \nfailed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. \n \nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores ≤ 12) on aripiprazole \n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46% decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65% decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into \nmania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence \ninto depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo on the secondary outcome \n\n\n\n16 \n\nmeasure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients were assigned by investigators with \neither open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine partial non-response. Patients were \nstabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination of aripiprazole and the same mood \nstabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the same mood stabilizer with double-blind \naripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were assessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole \n+ lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; placebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for \nrecurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive treatment arm were 16% in aripiprazole + lithium and \n18% in aripiprazole + valproate compared to 45% in placebo + lithium and 19% in placebo + valproate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSchizophrenia in adolescents \nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly \ngreater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of the adolescent \npatients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74% of the total enrolled population, maintenance \nof effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \n \nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects (n = 146; ages \n13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of relapse of \npsychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39%) and placebo (37.50%) groups. The point estimate of \nthe hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) in the full population. In subgroup \nanalyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to 14 years of age compared to 0.454 for \nsubjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the HR for the younger (13-14 years) group was \nnot precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in that group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), \nand the confidence interval for this estimation (ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be \ndrawn on the presence of a treatment effect. In contrast the 95% confidence interval for the HR in the older \nsubgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; placebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be \nconcluded in the older patients. \n \nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents (10-\n17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without \npsychotic features and had a Y-MRS score ≥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in the primary \nefficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \n \nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS total \nscore. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients with \nassociated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no difference \nfrom placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \n \nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were extrapyramidal \ndisorder (28.3%), somnolence (27.3%), headache (23.2%), and nausea (14.1%). Mean weight gain in the 30 \nweeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients treated with placebo. \n \nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one flexible-\ndose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label trial. Dosing in \nthese trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and increased by 5 mg/day in \nweekly increments to the target dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. Aripiprazole \ndemonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist \nIrritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. The safety \nprofile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The duration of the long-term safety study was \nlimited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \nand males (<2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 258/298 (86.6%), respectively. \nIn the placebo-controlled trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% \nfor aripiprazole and 52% for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks (aripiprazole/placebo) was \n0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over the stabilisation phase (up to 26 \nweeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of 2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to \n0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) of the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were \nmainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17% of patients, with tremor accounting for 6.5%. \n \nTics associated with Tourette’s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2)  \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette’s disorder (aripiprazole: n=99, \nplacebo: n=44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed dose weight-\nbased treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting dose of 2 mg. \nPatients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic Score on the Yale Global \nTic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an improvement on TTS-YGTSS change \nfrom baseline to week 8 of 13.35,for the low dose group (5 mg or 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group \n(10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of 7.09 in the placebo group.  \n \nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Tourette’s syndrome (aripiprazole: n=32, placebo: \nn=29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting dose of 2 mg, in \na 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-Korea. Patients were 6 - \n18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. Aripiprazole group showed an \nimprovement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 10 as compared with an improvement \nof 9.62 in the placebo group. \n \nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been established, \nconsidering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the unclear effects \nregarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the efficacy and the \nsafety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing aripiprazole in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the \ntreatment of schizophrenia and in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing. \nAripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet \nformulation is 87%. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nDistribution \n \nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, \nindicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-\naripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation. At \nsteady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in \nplasma. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nElimination \n \nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of \nCYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \n \nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces. Less than 1% of unchanged \naripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age \nwere similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nElderly \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult \nsubjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic \npatients. \n \nGender \nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects \nnor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic \npatients. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in \npatients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did \nnot reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-\naripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw \nconclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess \nof the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to \nclinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/or \nparenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/kg/day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state \nAUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined \n\n\n\n19 \n\nadrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at \nthe maximum recommended human dose). The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times \nthe human exposure at the recommended dose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy \nmetabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/kg/day (1 to 3 \ntimes the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the \nmaximum recommended human dose based on mg/m2). However, the concentrations of the sulphate \nconjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more \nthan 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their \nlimits of in vitro solubility. \n \nIn repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable to that \nobserved in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse reactions on development. \n \nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic. \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. Developmental toxicity, including dose-\ndependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses \nresulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 \ntimes the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at \ndoses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.
