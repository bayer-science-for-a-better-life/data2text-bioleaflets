NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVelphoro 500 mg chewable tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach chewable tablet contains 500 mg iron as sucroferric oxyhydroxide also known as a mixture of \npolynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose, and starches. \n \nThe active ingredient sucroferric oxyhydroxide contains 750 mg sucrose and 700 mg starches (potato \nstarch and pregelatinised maize starch) per tablet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nChewable tablet. \nBrown, circular tablets embossed with PA500 on one side. Tablets have a 20 mm diameter and a \nthickness of 6.5 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVelphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) \npatients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). \n \nVelphoro should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include \ncalcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 or one of its analogues, or calcimimetics to control \nthe development of renal bone disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStarting dose \n \nThe recommended starting dose of Velphoro is 1,500 mg iron (3 tablets) per day, divided across the \nmeals of the day. Velphoro is for oral administration only and must be taken with meals. \nPatients receiving Velphoro should adhere to their prescribed diets. \n \nTitration and maintenance \n \nSerum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of Velphoro up or down titrated in \nincrements of 500 mg iron (1 tablet) per day every 2 \u2013 4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus \nlevel is reached, with regular monitoring afterwards. \n \nIn clinical practice, treatment will be based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels, though \npatients who respond to Velphoro therapy usually achieve optimal serum phosphorus levels at doses of \n1,500 \u2013 2,000 mg iron per day (3 to 4 tablets). \n \nIf one or more doses are missed, the normal dose of the medicinal product should be resumed with the \nnext meal. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMaximum tolerated daily dose \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is 3,000 mg iron (6 tablets) per day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nElderly population (\u226565 years of age) \n \nVelphoro has been administered to over 248 seniors (\u226565 years of age) according to the approved \ndosing regimen. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Velphoro, 29.7% were aged 65 \nand over, while 8.7% were aged 75 and over. No special dose and administration guidelines were \napplied to seniors in these studies and the dosing schedules were not associated with any significant \nconcerns. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nVelphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult CKD patients on HD or PD. \nThere is no clinical data available with Velphoro in patients with earlier stages of renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from participating in clinical studies with \nVelphoro. However, no evidence of hepatic impairment or significant alteration of hepatic enzymes \nwere observed in the clinical studies with Velphoro. See further information in section 4.4. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nVelphoro is a chewable tablet that must be taken with meals. In order to maximise the adsorption of \ndietary phosphate, the total daily dose should be divided across the meals of the day. Patients are not \nrequired to drink more fluid than they normally would. Tablets must be chewed or crushed; tablets \nmust not be swallowed whole. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 Haemochromatosis and any other iron accumulation disorders. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPeritonitis, gastric and hepatic disorders and gastrointestinal surgery \n \nPatients with a recent history of peritonitis (within the last 3 months), significant gastric or hepatic \ndisorders and patients with major gastrointestinal surgery have not been included in clinical studies \nwith Velphoro. Velphoro should only be used in these patients following careful assessment of \nbenefit/risk. \n \nInformation about sucrose and starches (carbohydrates) \n \nVelphoro contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \nIt may be harmful to the teeth. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nVelphoro contains potato starch and pregelatinised maize starch. Patients with diabetes should take \nnotice that one tablet of Velphoro is equivalent to approximately 1.4 g of carbohydrates (equivalent to \n0.116 bread units). \n \nDiscoloured stool \n \nVelphoro can cause discoloured (black) stool. Discoloured (black) stool may visually mask \ngastrointestinal bleeding (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVelphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although the potential for interactions \nwith medicinal products seems low, for concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow \ntherapeutic window, the clinical effect and adverse events should be monitored, on initiation or dose-\nadjustment of either Velphoro or the concomitant medicinal product, or the physician should consider \nmeasuring blood levels. When administering any medicinal product that is already known to interact \nwith iron (like alendronate and doxycycline) or has the potential to interact with Velphoro based only \non in vitro studies like levothyroxine, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour \nbefore or two hours after Velphoro. \n \nIn vitro studies with the following active substances did not show any relevant interaction: \nacetylsalicylic acid, cephalexin, cinacalcet, ciprofloxacin, clopidogrel, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, \nmetformin, metoprolol, nifedipine, pioglitazone and quinidine. \n \nDrug-drug interaction studies have only been performed in healthy volunteers. They have been \nconducted in healthy human male and female subjects with losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin, \nand omeprazole. Concomitant administration of Velphoro did not affect the bioavailability of these \nmedicinal products as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). \n \nData from clinical studies have shown that Velphoro does not affect the lipid lowering effects of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin and simvastatin). In addition, post-hoc analyses \nfrom clinical studies demonstrated no impact of Velphoro on iPTH lowering effect of oral Vitamin D \nanalogues. Vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D levels remained unchanged. \n \nVelphoro does not affect guaiac based (Haemoccult) or immunological based (iColo Rectal and \nHexagon Obti) faecal occult blood tests. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available clinical data from the use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide on exposed human \npregnancies. \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals revealed no risk with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Velphoro should \nonly be used by pregnant women if clearly needed following careful assessment of benefit/risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no available clinical data from the use of Velphoro in breast-feeding women. Since \nabsorption of iron from Velphoro is minimal (see section 5.2), excretion of iron from Velphoro in \nbreast milk is unlikely. A decision on whether to continue breast-feeding or to continue therapy with \nVelphoro should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit \nof Velphoro therapy to the mother. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effect of Velphoro on fertility in humans. In animal studies, there were no \nadverse effects on mating performance, fertility, and litter parameters following treatment with \nVelphoro (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVelphoro has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe current safety profile of Velphoro is based on a total of 778 patients on haemodialysis and 57 \npatients on peritoneal dialysis, who received Velphoro treatment of up to 55 weeks. \n \nIn these clinical trials, approximately 43% of patients experienced at least one adverse reaction during \nVelphoro treatment, which were reported as serious adverse reactions in 0.36%. The majority of the \nadverse reactions reported from trials were gastrointestinal disorders, with the most frequently reported \nadverse reactions being diarrhoea and discoloured faeces (very common). The vast majority of these \ngastrointestinal disorders occurred early during treatment and abated with time with continued dosing. \nNo dose-dependent trends were observed in the adverse reaction profile of Velphoro. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported from the use of Velphoro at doses from 250 mg iron/day to 3,000 mg \niron/day in these patients (n=835) are listed in Table 1. \nThe reporting rate is classified as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions detected in clinical trials \n \nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  Hypercalcaemia \nHypocalcaemia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n  Headache \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea* \nFaeces discoloured \n\nNausea \nConstipation \n\nVomiting \nDyspepsia \n\nAbdominal pain \nFlatulence \n\nTooth discolouration \n\nAbdominal distension \nGastritis \n\nAbdominal discomfort \nDysphagia \n\nGastro-oesophageal \nreflux disease (GORD) \nTongue discolouration \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Pruritus Rash \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Product taste abnormal Fatigue \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n*Diarrhoea \n\nDiarrhoea occurred in 11.6% of patients in clinical trials. In the 55 weeks long term studies, the \nmajority of these diarrhoea adverse reactions were transient, occurred early during treatment \ninitiation and led to treatment discontinuation in 3.1% of the patients. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAny instances of overdose of Velphoro (e.g. hypophosphataemia) should be treated by standard \nclinical practice. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and hyperphosphataemia; ATC \ncode: V03AE05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVelphoro contains a mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide (pn-FeOOH), sucrose and starches. \nPhosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and/or water and the \nphosphate ions throughout the physiological pH range of the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nSerum phosphorus levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nOne phase 3 clinical study has been performed in patients with CKD on dialysis to investigate the \nefficacy and safety of Velphoro in this population. This study was an open-label, randomised, active-\ncontrolled (sevelamer carbonate), parallel group study for up to 55 weeks. Adult patients with \nhyperphosphataemia (serum phosphorus levels \u22651.94 mmol/L) were treated with Velphoro at a starting \ndose of 1,000 mg iron/day followed by an 8-week dose titration period. Non-inferiority to sevelamer \ncarbonate was determined at week 12. Subjects were continued on their study medication from \nweek 12 to week 55. From week 12 to 24, dose titrations were allowed for both tolerability and \nefficacy reasons. Treatment of patient sub-populations from week 24 to week 27 with maintenance \ndose of Velphoro (1,000 to 3,000 mg iron/day) or low dose (250 mg iron/day) of Velphoro \ndemonstrated superiority of the maintenance dose. \n \nIn Study-05A, 1,055 patients on hemodialysis (N=968) or peritoneal dialysis (N=87) with serum \nphosphorus \u22651.94 mmol/L following a 2 \u2013 4-week phosphate binder washout period, were randomized \nand treated with either Velphoro, at a starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day (N=707), or active-control \n(sevelamer carbonate, N=348) for 24 weeks. At the end of week 24, 93 patients on hemodialysis \nwhose serum phosphorus levels were controlled (<1.78 mmol/L) with Velphoro in the first part of the \nstudy, were re-randomized to continue treatment with either their week 24 maintenance dose (N=44 or \na non-effective low dose control 250 mg iron/day, N=49) of Velphoro for a further 3 weeks. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nFollowing completion of Study-05A, 658 patients (597 on hemodialysis and 61 on peritoneal dialysis) \nwere treated in the 28-week extension study (Study-05B) with either Velphoro (N=391) or sevelamer \ncarbonate (N=267) according to their original randomization. \n \nMean serum phosphorus levels were 2.5 mmol/L at baseline and 1.8 mmol/L at week 12 for Velphoro \n(reduction by 0.7 mmol/L). Corresponding levels for sevelamer carbonate at baseline were 2.4 mmol/L \nand 1.7 mmol/L at week 12 (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L), respectively. \n \nThe serum phosphorus reduction was maintained over 55 weeks. Serum phosphorus levels and \ncalcium-phosphorus product levels were reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate \nabsorption. \n \nThe response rates, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving serum phosphorus levels within the \nKDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) recommended range were 45.3% and 59.1% at \nweek 12 and 51.9% and 55.2% at week 52, for Velphoro and sevelamer carbonate, respectively. \n \nThe mean daily dose of Velphoro over 55 weeks of treatment was 1,650 mg iron and the mean daily \ndose of sevelamer carbonate was 6,960 mg. \n \nPost-authorization data \n \nA prospective, non-interventional, post-authorisation safety study (VERIFIE) has been conducted, \nevaluating the short- and long-term (up to 36 months) safety and effectiveness of Velphoro in adult \npatients on haemodialysis (n=1,198) or peritoneal dialysis (n=160), who were followed in routine \nclinical practice for 12 to 36 months (safety analysis set, N=1,365). During the study, 45% (n=618) of \nthese patients were concomitantly treated with phosphate binder(s) other than Velphoro. \n \nIn the safety analysis set, the most common ADRs were diarrhoea and discoloured faeces, reported by \n14% (n=194) and 9% (n=128) of patients, respectively. The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the \nfirst week and decreased with duration of use. Diarrhoea was of mild to moderate intensity in most \npatients and resolved in the majority of patients within 2 weeks. Discoloured (black) faeces is expected \nfor an oral iron-based compound, and may visually mask gastrointestinal bleeding. For 4 of the 40 \ndocumented concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding events, Velphoro-related stool discolouration was \nreported as causing an insignificant delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, without affecting \npatient health. In the remaining cases, no delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding has been \nreported. \n \nThe results from this study showed that the effectiveness of Velphoro in a real-life setting (including \nconcomitant use of other phosphate binders in 45% of patients), was in line with that observed in the \nphase 3 clinical study. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVelphoro in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nVelphoro works by binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the serum concentration is \nnot relevant for its efficacy. Due to the insolubility and degradation characteristics of Velphoro, no \nclassical pharmacokinetic studies can be carried out, e.g., determination of the distribution volume, \narea under the curve, mean residence time, etc. \n \nIn 2 Phase 1 studies, it was concluded that the potential for iron overload is minimal and no dose \ndependent effects were observed in healthy volunteers. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAbsorption \n \nThe active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is practically insoluble and therefore not absorbed. Its \ndegradation product, mononuclear iron species, can however be released from the surface of pn-\nFeOOH and be absorbed. \n \nThe absolute absorption studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species \n(rats and dogs) showed that systemic absorption was very low (\u22641% of the administered dose). \n \nThe iron uptake from radiolabelled Velphoro drug substance, 2,000 mg iron in 1 day was investigated \nin 16 CKD patients (8 pre-dialysis and 8 haemodialysis patients) and 8 healthy volunteers with low \niron stores (serum ferritin <100 mcg/L). In healthy subjects, the median uptake of radiolabelled iron in \nthe blood was estimated to be 0.43% (range 0.16 \u2013 1.25%) on Day 21, in pre-dialysis patients 0.06% \n(range 0.008 \u2013 0.44%) and in haemodialysis patients 0.02% (range 0 \u2013 0.04%). Blood levels of \nradiolabelled iron were very low and confined to the erythrocytes. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe distribution studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species (rats \nand dogs) showed that pn-FeOOH is distributed from the plasma to the liver, spleen and bone marrow, \nand utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. \n \nIn patients, absorbed iron is expected to be also distributed to the target organs, i.e. liver, spleen and \nbone marrow, and utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is not metabolised. However, the degradation product of \nVelphoro, mononuclear iron species, can be released from the surface of polynuclear iron(III)-\noxyhydroxide and be absorbed. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the systemic absorption of iron \nfrom Velphoro is low. \n \nIn vitro data suggest that the sucrose and starch components of the drug substance can be digested to \nglucose and fructose, and maltose and glucose, respectively. These compounds can be absorbed in the \nblood. \n \nElimination \n \nIn animal studies with rats and dogs administered 59Fe-Velphoro drug substance orally, radiolabelled \niron was recovered in the faeces but not the urine. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \nEffects seen in the rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study (skeletal variations and incomplete \nossificaton) are related to exaggerated pharmacology, and likely not relevant for patients. Other \nreproduction toxicity studies showed no adverse effects. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. There was no clear evidence of a \ncarcinogenic effect in mice. Mucosal hyperplasia, with diverticulum/cyst formation was observed in \nthe colon and caecum of mice after 2-years treatment, but this was considered a species-specific effect \nwith no diverticula/cysts seen in long term studies in rats or dogs. In rats, there was a slightly increased \nincidence of benign C-cell adenoma in the thyroid of male rats given the highest dose of sucroferric \noxyhydroxide. This is thought to be most likely an adaptive response to the pharmacological effect of \nthe drug, and not clinically relevant. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nVelphoro 500 mg chewable tablets \niron as sucroferric oxyhydroxide \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n\u2013 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\u2013 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Velphoro is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Velphoro \n3. How to take Velphoro \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Velphoro \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Velphoro is and what it is used for \n \nVelphoro is a medicine that contains the active substance sucroferric oxyhydroxide, which is made up \nfrom iron, sugar (sucrose) and starches. \n \nVelphoro is for use by adult patients who undergo haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (procedures to \neliminate toxic substances from the blood) because of chronic kidney disease; it is used in order to \nhelp control the phosphorus level in their blood when it is too high (hyperphosphataemia). \n \nToo much phosphorus in the blood can lead to calcium being deposited in tissues (calcification). This \ncan result in stiffening of the blood vessels, making it harder for the blood to be pumped around the \nbody. It may also lead to calcium deposits in soft tissues and bone causing effects such as red eyes, \nitchy skin and bone pain. \n \nVelphoro works by binding phosphorus from food in your digestive tract (stomach and intestines). \nThis reduces the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and thus lowers \nphosphorus levels in your blood. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Velphoro \n \nDo not take Velphoro: \n \n\u2013 if you are allergic to sucroferric oxyhydroxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2013 if you have a history of abnormal iron build-up in your organs (haemochromatosis) \n\u2013 if you have any other disorder associated with too much iron. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Velphoro: \n\u2013 if you have had peritonitis, an inflammation of the peritoneum (the thin tissue that lines the inner \n\nwall of the abdomen) within the last 3 months, \n\u2013 if you have significant stomach and/or liver problems, \n\u2013 if you have had major surgery on your stomach and/or intestines. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nthis medicine. \n \nVelphoro can cause black stools. Any potential bleeding from your digestive tract (stomach and gut) \nmay be hidden by these black stools. If you have black stools and also have symptoms like \nincreasing tiredness and breathlessness contact your doctor immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not yet \nbeen established. Therefore Velphoro is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Velphoro \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nIf you are taking any other medicine that is known to be affected by iron (for example medicines \ncontaining the active substance alendronate (used to treat certain bone disorders) or doxycycline (an \nantibiotic)) or has the potential to be affected by iron (for example medicines containing the active \nsubstance levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid function disorder)), make sure that you take this \nmedicine at least one hour before taking Velphoro or at least two hours after taking Velphoro. Ask \nyour doctor if you are not sure. \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding \n \nThere is no information on the effects of this medicine if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. If \nyou are pregnant or breastfeeding, or you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nYour doctor will advise you whether Velphoro should be used during pregnancy, based on benefit and \nrisk assessment for use during pregnancy. \n \nIf you are breastfeeding, your doctor will discuss with you whether to continue breastfeeding or to \ncontinue therapy with Velphoro, taking into account the benefit of Velphoro therapy to you and the \nbenefit of breastfeeding to your child. \n \nIt is unlikely that this medicine would pass into the mother\u2019s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine has no significant effect on your ability to drive or to use tools or machines. \n \nVelphoro contains sucrose and starches (carbohydrates) \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nVelphoro may be harmful to the teeth. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nVelphoro contains starches. If you have diabetes you should take notice that one tablet of Velphoro is \nequivalent to approximately 1.4 g of carbohydrates (equivalent to 0.116 bread units). \n \n \n3. How to take Velphoro \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe usual recommended starting dose is the equivalent of 1,500 mg iron per day (3 tablets). \nThe maximum recommended dose is 3,000 mg iron (6 tablets) per day. \n \nYour doctor may adjust the dose during the treatment course depending on the phosphorus level in \nyour blood. \n \nMethod of administration \n \n\u2013 Velphoro should only be taken by mouth. \n\u2013 Take the tablet during a meal and chew it (if necessary, the tablet may be crushed to make this \n\neasier for you). DO NOT swallow it whole. \n\u2013 The amount of tablets taken per day should be divided across the meals of the day. \n\u2013 When taking Velphoro you should adhere to your recommended diet and treatments prescribed \n\nby your doctor such as calcium supplements, vitamin D3 or calcimimetics. \n \nOnly for the blister packs: \n\u2013 Separate the blister pack at perforations. \n\u2013 Peel back the paper foil at the corner. \n\u2013 Push the tablet through the aluminium foil. \n \nIf you take more Velphoro than you should \n \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, do not take any more and talk to your doctor or \npharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Velphoro \n \nIf you have missed a dose, just take the next dose at the usual time with a meal. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Velphoro \n \nDo not stop taking the medicine before talking to your doctor or pharmacist as the phosphorus level in \nyour blood may increase (see section 1). \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nBlack stools may occur very commonly in patients taking Velphoro. If you also have symptoms like \nincreasing tiredness and breathlessness contact your doctor immediately (see section 2 \u201cWarnings\u201d). \n \nThe following side effects have also been reported in patients taking this medicine: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea (generally occurring early on in the \ntreatment, and improving over time). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): feeling sick (nausea), constipation, vomiting, indigestion, \npain in stomach and gut, gas, tooth discolouration, change in taste. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): bloating (abdominal distension), inflammation of the \nstomach, abdominal discomfort, difficulty swallowing, acid coming back up from the stomach (gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease), tongue discolouration, low or high calcium levels in the blood seen in \ntests, tiredness, itch, rash, headache, shortness of breath. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Velphoro \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date stated on the carton, bottle or blister after \u201cEXP\u201d. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nAfter first opening of the bottle the chewable tablets can be used for 90 days. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
