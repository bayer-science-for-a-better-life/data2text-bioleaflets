NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTelzir 700 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 700 mg of fosamprenavir as fosamprenavir calcium (equivalent to \napproximately 600 mg of amprenavir). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nPink film coated, capsule shaped, biconvex tablets, marked with GXLL7 on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nTelzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is indicated for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 6 years and \nabove in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \n \nIn moderately antiretroviral experienced adults, Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir has not \nbeen shown to be as effective as lopinavir / ritonavir. No comparative studies have been undertaken in \nchildren or adolescents. \n \nIn heavily pretreated patients the use of Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir has not been \nsufficiently studied. \n \nIn protease inhibitor (PI) experienced patients the choice of Telzir should be based on individual viral \nresistance testing and treatment history (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTelzir must only be given with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of amprenavir and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \nritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Telzir. \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nFosamprenavir is a pro-drug of amprenavir and must not be administered concomitantly with other \nmedicinal products containing amprenavir. \n \nThe importance of complying with the full recommended dosing regimen should be stressed to all \npatients. \n \nCaution is advised if the recommended doses of Telzir with ritonavir detailed below are exceeded (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTelzir tablet is administered orally.  \nTelzir tablet can be taken with or without food. \n \nTelzir is also available as an oral suspension for use in patients unable to swallow tablets, and in \npaediatric patients less than 39 kg (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Telzir \noral suspension). \n \nAdults \n \nThe recommended dose is 700 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily. \n \nPaediatric patients from 6 years of age \n \nThe adult dose of Telzir tablet 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily may be used in \nchildren weighing at least 39 kg and able to swallow tablets. \nFor children weighing less than 39 kg, Telzir oral suspension is the recommended option for the most \naccurate dosing in children based on body weight (please refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for Telzir oral suspension). \n \nChildren less than 6 years of age  \n \nTelzir with ritonavir is not recommended in children below 6 years due to insufficient data on \npharmacokinetics, safety and antiviral response (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir have not been studied in this patient population (see section \n5.2). Therefore, no recommendations can be made in this patient population. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFor adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) the recommended dose is 700 mg \nfosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. \n \nFor adults with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) the recommended dose is \n450 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. This adjusted dose has not been \nevaluated in a clinical study and has been derived from extrapolation (see section 5.2). As it is not \npossible to achieve this fosamprenavir dose using the tablet formulation, these patients should be \ntreated with fosamprenavir oral suspension. \n \nFor adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 10-15): fosamprenavir should be used \nwith caution and at a reduced dose of 300 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once \ndaily. As it is not possible to achieve this fosamprenavir dose using the tablet formulation, these \npatients should be treated with fosamprenavir oral suspension. \n \nOverall, even with these dose adjustments for adults with hepatic impairment, some patients may have \nhigher or lower than anticipated amprenavir and/or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to \npatients with normal hepatic function, due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), \ntherefore close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted. \n \nNo dose recommendation can be made for children and adolescents with hepatic impairment as no \nstudies have been conducted in these age groups. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to fosamprenavir, amprenavir, or ritonavir, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1. \n \nTelzir must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, \nastemizole, bepridil, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, \nterfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), \noral triazolam, sildenafil used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (for use of \nsildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction, see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of the antipsychotic medicinal product lurasidone and fosamprenavir/ritonavir \n(FPV/RTV) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).  \n \n \nCo-administration of paritaprevir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV) is contraindicated due to \nthe expected increase of paritaprevir exposure and the lack of clinical data assessing the magnitude of \nthis increase (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Telzir with simvastatin or lovastatin is contraindicated because of increased \nplasma concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin which can increase the risk of myopathy, \nincluding rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.5). \nTelzir with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, e.g. flecainide and propafenone (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCombination of rifampicin with Telzir with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \nTelzir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of amprenavir \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n \nPatients should be advised that treatment with Telzir, or any other current antiretroviral therapy, does \nnot cure HIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV \ninfection.  \n \nFosamprenavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between medicinal \nproducts in the sulphonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In the pivotal studies of Telzir, in \npatients receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir there was no evidence of an increased risk of rashes in \npatients with a history of sulphonamide allergy versus those who did not have a sulphonamide allergy. \nYet, Telzir should be used with caution in patients with a known sulphonamide allergy. \n \nCo-administration of Telzir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily \nhas not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the \ncombination and therefore is not recommended. \n \nLiver disease \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTelzir with ritonavir should be used with caution and at reduced doses in adults with mild, moderate, \nor severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for \nthese medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nMedicinal products \u2013 interactions \n \nThe use of Telzir concomitantly with halofantrine or lidocaine (systemic) is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: The use of Telzir concomitantly with \nPDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nCo-administration of Telzir with low dose ritonavir and these medicinal products is expected to \nsubstantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.5).  Note that co-administration of \nTelzir with low dose ritonavir with sildenafil used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \nis contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nA reduction in the rifabutin dosage by at least 75 % is recommended when administered with Telzir \nwith ritonavir. Further dose reduction may be necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nBecause there may be an increased risk of hepatic transaminase elevations and hormonal levels may \nbe altered with co-administration of fosamprenavir, ritonavir and oral contraceptives, alternative non-\nhormonal methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing potential (see \nsection 4.5). \nNo data are available on the co-administration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir with oestrogens and/or \nprogestogens when used as hormonal replacement therapies. The efficacy and safety of these therapies \nwith fosamprenavir and ritonavir has not been established. \n \nAnticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be used with caution. Telzir may be less \neffective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these medicinal \nproducts concomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant medicinal products \n(cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin) when co-administered with Telzir (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine \nand nortriptyline) when coadministered with Telzir (see section 4.5). \n \nWhen warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are coadministered with Telzir a reinforced monitoring of \nINR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Telzir with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised \nby CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section \n4.5). \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCo-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with other antineoplastics metabolised by CYP3A (for \nexample dasatinib, nilotinib, ibrutinib, vinblastine and everolimus) may increase concentrations of \nthese medicinal products, potentially increasing the risk of adverse events usually associated with \nthese agents. Please refer to the relevant product information for these medications (see section 4.5).   \n \nHepatitis C virus (HCV) Direct-Acting Antivirals: When hepatitis C virus direct-acting antiviral \n(DAA) drugs, which are metabolised by CYP3A4 or are inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4, are co-\nadministered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir, altered plasma concentrations of medications are expected \ndue to inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 enzyme activity (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nRash / cutaneous reactions \n \nMost patients with mild or moderate rash can continue Telzir. Appropriate antihistamines (e.g. \ncetirizine dihydrochloride) may reduce pruritus and hasten the resolution of rash. Severe and \nlife-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, were reported in less than 1% of \npatients included in the clinical development programme. Telzir should be permanently discontinued \nin case of severe rash, or in case of rash of moderate intensity with systemic or mucosal symptoms \n(see section 4.8). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors (PIs). In some \npatients administration of factor VIII was necessary. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment \nwith protease inhibitors was continued, or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be informed of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported \nto occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable \nand can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWhen fosamprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug \ninteraction profile may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. The \nfull prescribing information for ritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of \ntherapy with Telzir with ritonavir. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 but to a lesser extent than \nCYP3A4. Ritonavir induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and glucuronosyl transferase. \n \nAdditionally, both amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, and ritonavir are primarily \nmetabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, any medicinal products that either share this \nmetabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and \nritonavir. Similarly administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir may modify the pharmacokinetics \nof other active substances that share this metabolic pathway. \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nUnless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir (i.e. 700/100 mg twice daily), and the interaction was assessed under steady-\nstate conditions where drugs were administered for 10 to 21 days.  \n \n\nDrugs by Therapeutic Area Interaction \n \nGeometric mean change \n(%) \n \n(Possible mechanism) \n\nRecommendation \nconcerning co-\nadministration \n\nANTIRETROVIRAL \nMEDICINAL PRODUCTS \n \n\n  \n\nNon-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors: \n \n\n  \n\nEfavirenz  \n600 mg once daily  \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is observed. \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nNevirapine  \n200 mg twice daily  \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is observed. \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n \n\nEtravirine \n \n \n(Study conducted in 8 \npatients) \n\nAmprenavir AUC \u2191 69% \nAmprenavir Cmin \u2191 77% \nAmprenavir Cmax \u2191 62% \n \nEtravirine AUC \u2194a \nEtravirine Cmin\u2194a \nEtravirine Cmax\u2194a \n \n\n a Comparison based on \nhistoric control. \n \n\nTelzir may require dose \nreduction (using oral \nsuspension). \n\nNucleoside / Nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase \ninhibitors: \n \n\n  \n\nAbacavir \nLamivudine  \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nZidovudine  \n \nStudy performed with \namprenavir. \n \nNo FPV/RTV drug \ninteraction studies. \n \n\n  \n\nDidanosine chewable tablet \n \nNo drug interaction studies. \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n \n\nNo dose separation or dosage \nadjustment necessary (see \nAntacids).  \n \n\nDidanosine gastro-resistant \ncapsule \n \nNo drug interaction studies. \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nTenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg once daily \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction observed. \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\n \n \n\nProtease Inhibitors: \nAccording to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally \nnot recommended. \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir \n400 mg/100 mg  \ntwice daily  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir \n533 mg/133 mg twice daily  \n \n \n(Telzir 1400 mg twice daily) \n \n\nLopinavir: Cmax\u2191 30% \nLopinavir: AUC \u2191 37% \nLopinavir: Cmin \u2191 52% \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2193 58% \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2193 63% \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2193 65% \n \nLopinavir: Cmax \u2194* \nLopinavir: AUC \u2194* \nLopinavir: Cmin \u2194* \n* compared to lopinavir / \nritonavir 400 mg/100 mg \ntwice daily \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2193 13%* \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2193 26%* \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2193 42 %* \n* compared to fosamprenavir \n/ ritonavir 700 mg/100 mg \ntwice daily  \n \n(Mixed CYP3A4 \ninduction/inhibition, Pgp \ninduction) \n\nConcomitant use is not \nrecommended. \n \n\nIndinavir \nSaquinavir \n \nNo drug interaction studies.  \n\n \n \n\nNo dose recommendations \ncan be given. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAtazanavir \n \n300 mg once daily  \n \n \n\nAtazanavir: Cmax \u2193 24%* \nAtazanavir: AUC\u2193 22%*  \nAtazanavir: Cmin\u2194* \n *compared to atazanavir/ \nritonavir 300 mg/ 100 mg \nonce daily  \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2194 \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2194 \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2194 \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nIntegrase inhibitors \n \nRaltegravir \n \n400 mg twice daily \n\nFasting state \n \nAmprenavir :  \nCmax \u2193 14% (-36%; +15%) \nAUC \u2193 16% (-36%; +8%) \nCmin \u2193 19% (-42%; +13%)  \n \nRaltegravir: \nCmax \u2193 51% (-75%; -3%) \nAUC \u2193 55% (-76%; -16%) \nCmin \u2193 36 % (-57%; -3%)  \n \nFed state \n \nAmprenavir: \nCmax \u2193 25% (-41%; -4%) \nAUC \u2193 25% (-42%; -3%) \nCmin \u2193 33% (-50%; -10%)  \n \nRaltegravir:  \nCmax \u2193 56% (-70%; -34%) \nAUC \u2193 54% (-66%; -37%) \nCmin \u2193 54 % (-74%; -18%)  \n \n\nConcomitant use is not \nrecommended.

Placental transfer of amprenavir has been shown to occur in humans. \n \nIn animal studies at systemic plasma exposures (AUC) to amprenavir lower than therapeutic exposure \nin patients treated with Telzir, some developmental toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). In view of \nthe low exposure in reproductive toxicity studies, the potential developmental toxicity of Telzir has \nnot been fully determined. \n \nTelzir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAmprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir is excreted \nin human milk. Rat pups exposed pre and post-natally to amprenavir and fosamprenavir showed \ndevelopmental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIt is recommended that HIV-infected women must not breast-feed under any circumstances to avoid \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of fosamprenavir on fertility are available. In rats, there was no major \neffect on fertillty or reproductive performance with fosamprenavir (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Telzir in combination with ritonavir on the ability to drive and use \nmachines have been performed. The adverse reaction profile of Telzir should be borne in mind when \nconsidering the patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n\nThe adverse reaction profile was similar across all the respective adult studies: antiretroviral na\u00efve \npatients (APV30002, ESS100732), protease inhibitor experienced (twice daily dosing, APV30003) \npatients. This is based on safety data from a total of 864 patients exposed to fosamprenavir/ritonavir in \nthese three studies. \n \nThe most frequently (> 5% of adult subjects treated) reported adverse reactions with \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir combination were gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal \npain and vomiting) and headache. Most adverse reactions associated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir \ncombination therapies were mild to moderate in severity, early in onset and rarely treatment limiting. \nMore serious adverse reactions such as serious skin rashes and hepatic transaminase elevations have \nalso been reported (cf paragraph Description of selected adverse reactions). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10), Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or Very rare (< 1/10,000), or Not known. \n \nFrequency categories for the reactions below have been based on clinical trials and postmarketing \ndata. \n \nMost of the adverse reactions below were reported from three large clinical studies in adults, where \nthe adverse events were of at least moderate intensity (Grade 2 or more) occurring in at least 1% of \npatients and reported by investigators as being attributable to the medicinal products used in the \nstudies.  \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nBody System Adverse reaction Frequency \n \nNervous system disorders \n \n\n \nHeadache, dizziness, oral \nparaesthesia \n \n\n \nCommon \n\n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \nDiarrhoea \n\n \nVery common \n\n  \nLoose stools, nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain \n\n \nCommon \n\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\n \nStevens Johnson syndrome \n \nAngioedema \n \nRash (see text below \n\u201crash/cutaneous reactions\u201d) \n \n\n \nRare  \n \nUncommon \n \nCommon \n \n \n\n \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\n \nFatigue \n\n \nCommon \n\nInvestigations Blood cholesterol increased  \n \nBlood triglycerides increased \n \nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased \n \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased \n \nLipase increased \n \n \n\nVery common \n \nCommon \n \nCommon \n \n \nCommon \n \n \nCommon \n \n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nRash / cutaneous reactions: erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or without \npruritus, may occur during therapy. The rash generally will resolve spontaneously without the \nnecessity of discontinuing treatment with the fosamprenavir with ritonavir. \n \nSevere or life-threatening cases of rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome are rare. Fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir therapy should be definitively stopped in case of severe rash or in case of rash of mild or \nmoderate intensity associated with systemic or mucosal signs (see section 4.4). \n \nClinical chemistry abnormalities: clinical chemistry abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) potentially related to \ntreatment with fosamprenavir with ritonavir and reported in greater than or equal to 1 % of adult \npatients, included: increased ALT (common), AST (common), serum lipase (common) and \ntriglycerides (common).  \n \nMetabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during \nantiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nRhabdomyolysis: an increase in CPK, myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis, have been \nreported with protease inhibitors, more specifically in association with nucleoside analogues. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic \nor residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have \nalso been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset \nis more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally \nacknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of \nthis is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric / other populations \n\nChildren and adolescents: The adverse reaction profile in children and adolescents is based on \nintegrated safety data from two studies (APV29005 Week 24 data and APV20003 Week 168 data \n[final data]) in which 158 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 18 years of age received fosamprenavir with \nritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1 for \ninformation on dosing regimens applied for each age group). 79 % of subjects received greater than 48 \nweeks of exposure. \nOverall the safety profile in these 158 children and adolescents was similar to that observed in the \nadult population.  Vomiting occurred more frequently amongst paediatric patients. Drug-related \nadverse reactions were more common in APV20003 (57%) where subjects received once daily \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir when compared to APV29005 (33%) where subjects received twice daily \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir. \nNo new safety concerns were identified from analyses of 48 week data from studies APV29005 or \nAPV20002, in which 54 subjects 4 weeks to <2 years of age received twice daily fosamprenavir / \nritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy and 5 subjects received \nonly single doses of fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir. \n \nHaemophiliac patients: There have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac \npatients receiving antiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for Telzir. It is not known whether amprenavir can be removed by \nperitoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence \nof toxicity (see section 4.8) and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitor, ATC Code: J05AE07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\nThe in vitro antiviral activity observed with fosamprenavir is due to the presence of trace amounts of \namprenavir. Amprenavir is a competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the \nactive site of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein \nprecursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. \n \nAdministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily results in \nplasma amprenavir concentrations (data from study APV30003 in antiretroviral experienced patients) \nwhich results in protein adjusted median ratios of Cmin/IC50 and Cmin/IC95 of 21.7 (range 1.19-240) and \n3.21 (range 0.26-30.0), respectively. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and \nchronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 \u00b5M in \nacutely infected cells and was 0.41 \u00b5M in chronically infected cells (1 \u00b5M = 0.50 \u00b5g/ml). The \nrelationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication \nin humans has not been defined. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vivo \n \n\na) ART-na\u00efve or PI-na\u00efve patients \n \n\nVarious regimens have been assessed in the amprenavir/fosamprenavir development programs with \nand without co-administration of ritonavir. Analysis of the virological failure samples across these \nregimens defined four main resistance pathways: V32I+I47V, I50V, I54L/M and I84V.  Additional \nmutations observed which may contribute to resistance were: L10V/F/R, I13V, K20R/T, L33F/V, \nM36I, M46I/L, I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L.   \n\n \nWhen ART na\u00efve adult patients were treated with the currently approved doses of \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir, as for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were \ninfrequently observed. Sixteen of 434 ART-na\u00efve patients who received fosamprenavir 700 \nmg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 \nisolates genotyped. Three of 14 isolates had protease resistance mutations. One resistance mutation \nwas observed in each of 3 isolates: K20K/R, I54I/L and I93I/L respectively  \n \nAmong the 81 PI-na\u00efve paediatric patients treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir, 15 patients met \nprotocol-defined virological failure through 48 weeks in APV29005 and up to 108 weeks in \nAPV20003.  Treatment-emergent major or APV-associated protease mutations were observed in virus \nisolated from 2 patients. Resistance patterns were similar to those observed in adults. \n \n\nb) PI-experienced patients \n \nAmprenavir  \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced adult patients, PRO30017 (amprenavir 600 mg / ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily in sub-study A and B with 80 and 37 patients respectively), the following mutations \nemerged in patients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, \nM46I/L, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, \nL90M and I93L/M. \n \nFosamprenavir \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn the studies of PI-experienced adult patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 \n(fosamprenavir 700 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in \npatients experiencing virological failure through 96 weeks: L10F/I, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, \nI47V, I50V, I54L/M/S, A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M.  \n \nIn the paediatric studies APV20003 and APV29005, 77 PI-experienced patients were treated with \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir-based regimens and 43 patients met study-defined virologic failure criteria \nthrough 48 weeks in APV29005 and up to 108 weeks in APV20003. Treatment-emergent major \nprotease or APV-associated mutations were observed in virus isolated from 1 patient in APV29005 \nand 6 patients from APV20003.  The mutational profiles were similar to those described for PI-\nexperienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. \n \nAntiviral activity according to genotypic/phenotypic resistance \n \nGenotypic resistance testing \n \nGenotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates. The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 \nalgorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations \nV32I+I47A/V, or I50V, or at least four mutations among: L10F/I/V, L33F, M36I, I54A/L/M/S/T/V, \nI62V, V82A/C/F/G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance). \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nPhenotypic resistance testing \n \nClinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic \ndata to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI-\nresistant isolates.  Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs \nfor FPV/RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results. \n \nClinical experience \n \nClinical experience with fosamprenavir boosted with ritonavir is mainly based on two open label \nstudies one in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients (study ESS100732), and one study in antiretroviral \nexperienced patients (study APV30003).  Both of these studies compared fosamprenavir/ritonavir with \nlopinavir / ritonavir. \n \nAntiretroviral Na\u00efve Adult Patients \n \nIn a randomised open-label study (ESS100732 - KLEAN) in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients, \nfosamprenavir (700 mg) co-administered with low dose ritonavir (100 mg) in a twice daily regimen \nincluding abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg) fixed dose combination tablet once daily showed \ncomparable efficacy over 48 weeks to lopinavir / ritonavir (400 mg / 100 mg) given twice daily in \ncombination with abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg once daily). \n \nNon-inferiority was demonstrated between fosamprenavir co-administered with ritonavir and lopinavir \n/ ritonavir based on the proportions of patients achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 400 copies/ml at \n48 weeks (primary endpoint). In the Time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) analysis for the \nITT(E) population, the proportion of patients achieving <400 copies/ml was 73 % (315 / 434) in the \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir group compared to 71 % (317 / 444) of patients receiving lopinavir / \nritonavir, with a 95 % confidence interval of the difference of [-4,84%; 7;05%].  \n \nEfficacy outcomes by subgroups are described in the table below. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nTable 1   Efficacy Outcome at Week 48 in ESS100732 (ART-Na\u00efve Patients) \n\n FPV/RTV 700 mg/100 mg \nBID (n= 434) \n\nLPV/RTV 400 mg/100 mg BID \n(n=444) \n\nITT-E Population \nTLOVR analysis \n\nProportion with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml \n\nAll Subjects 72.5 % 71.4% \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA \n < 100,000 copies/ml \n\n69.5 % (n=197) 69.4% (n=209) \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA  \n\u2265 100,000 copies/ml \n\n75.1% (n=237) 73.2% (n=235) \n\n Proportion with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml \n\nAll Subjects 66% 65% \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA  \n< 100,000 copies/ml \n\n67% (n=197) 64% (n=209) \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA  \n\u2265 100,000 copies/ml \n\n65% (n=237) 66% (n=235) \n\n Median Change from baseline in CD4 cells (cells/\u00b5l) \n\nITT-E observed \nanalysis \n\n176 (n=323) 191 (n=336) \n\n \nFollowing completion of the 48 week treatment period, subjects at European and Canadian sites were \neligible to participate in a study extension to Week 144 maintaining their treatment regimen as per the \noriginal randomisation.

Results were in \nfavour of the lopinavir / ritonavir arm as detailed below. \n \nAll patients in this study had failed treatment with a previous protease inhibitor regimen (defined as \nplasma HIV-1 RNA that never went below 1,000 copies/ml after at least 12 consecutive weeks of \ntherapy, or initial suppression of HIV-1 RNA which subsequently rebounded to \u2265 1,000 copies/ml). \nHowever, only 65 % of patients were receiving a PI based regimen at study entry. \n \nThe population enrolled mainly consisted of moderately antiretroviral experienced patients. The \nmedian durations of prior exposure to NRTIs were 257 weeks for patients receiving fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir twice daily (79 % had \u2265 3 prior NRTIs) and 210 weeks for patients receiving \nlopinavir/ritonavir (64 % had \u2265 3 prior NRTIs). The median durations of prior exposure to protease \ninhibitors were 149 weeks for patients receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir twice daily (49 % \nreceived \u2265 2 prior PIs) and 130 weeks for patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (40 % received \n\u2265 2 prior PIs). \n \nThe mean AAUCMBs (log10 c/ml) in the ITT (E) population (Observed analysis) at 48 weeks (primary \nend-point) and other efficacy outcomes by subgroup are described in the tables below: \n \nTable 3   Efficacy at Week 48 Outcomes in APV30003 ITT(E) Population (ART-experienced \nPatients) \n\n FPV/RTV BID \n\n(N=107) \n\nLPV/RTV BID \n\n(N=103) \n\nAAUCMB Observed Analysis Mean (n) Mean (n) \n\nAll Patients -1.53 (105) -1.76 (103) \n\n     1000 \u2013 10,000 copies/ml -1.53 (41) -1.43 (43) \n\n     >10,000 \u2013 100,000 copies/ml -1.59 (45) -1.81 (46) \n\n     >100,000 copies/ml -1.38 (19) -2.61 (14) \n\nFPV/RTV BID vs LPV/RTV BID AAUCMB Mean Diff (97.5% CI) \n\nAll Patients 0.244 (-0.047, 0.536) \n\n\n\n26 \n\n     1000 \u2013 10,000 copies/ml -0.104 (-0.550, 0.342) \n\n     >10,000 \u2013 100,000 copies/ml 0.216 (-0.213, 0.664) \n\n     >100,000 copies/ml 1.232 (0.512, 1.952) \n\nAAUCMB Observed Analysis Mean (n) Mean (n) \n\nAll Patients -1.53 (105) -1.76 (103) \n\n         CD4-count    <50 -1.28 (7) -2.45 (8) \n\n                              \u226550 -1.55 (98) -1.70 (95) \n\n                              <200 -1.68 (32) -2.07 (38) \n\n                             \u2265 200  -1.46 (73) -1.58 (65) \n\n         GSS to OBT1       0 -1.42 (8) -1.91 (4) \n\n                                     1 -1.30 (35) -1.59 (23) \n\n                                   \u2265 2 -1.68 (62) -1.80 (76) \n\nAll Patients, RD=F Analysis2  n (%) n(%) \n\nSubjects (%) with plasma HIV-1 RNA \n<50 copies/ml \n\n49 (46%) 52 (50%) \n\nSubjects (%) with plasma HIV-1 RNA \n<400 copies/ml \n\n62 (58%) 63 (61%) \n\nSubjects with >1 log10 change from \nbaseline in plasma  HIV-\n1 RNA \n\n62 (58%) 71 (69%) \n\nChange from baseline in CD4 cells \n(cells/\u00b5l) \n\nMedian (n) Median (n) \n\nAll Patients 81 (79) 91 (85) \n\nKey: 1GSS to OBT: Genotypic Sensitivity Score to Optimised Background.

The benefit in \nthis age group has mainly been derived from study APV29005, an open label 48 week study \nevaluating the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with ritonavir \nadministered twice daily to HIV 1 protease inhibitor experienced and naive patients 2 to 18 years of \nage. Results through 48 weeks of treatment are provided below. \n \nAPV29005 enrolled 30 patients aged 6 to 11 (the majority of whom were treated with fosamprenavir / \nritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily or the adult tablet regimen), and 40 patients aged 12 to 18 (the \nmajority of whom were treated with the adult tablet regimen). \n \nTable 5   Baseline Characteristics and Efficacy Outcomes at Week 48 in APV29005 ITT(E) \nPopulation \n\n Patients aged 6 to 11 \nN=30 \n\nPatients aged 12 to 18 \nN=40 \n\nBaseline Characteristics   \nART/PI status, n (%)   \n\nART-na\u00efve 2 (7) 14 (35) \nART-experienced, PI-na\u00efve 8 (27) 12 (30) \nPI-experienced 20 (67) 14 (35) \n\nMedian duration of prior ART exposure, weeks   \nNRTI 386        409 \nPI 253 209 \n\nMedian plasma HIV-1 RNA log10 copies/mL 4.6 (n=29) 4.7 \n>100,000 copies/ml, n (%) 9 (31) 13 (33) \nMedian CD4 cells/\u03bcl 470 250 \n\nCD4 count < 350 cells/\u03bcl, n (%) 10 (33) 27 (68) \nEfficacy Outcomes   \nPatients with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 \ncopies/ml, Snapshot analysis \n\n16 (53%) 25 (63%) \n\nMedian change from baseline in CD4 cells \n(cells/\u03bcl), observed analysis \n\n210 (n=21) 140 (n=35) \n\n \nThese data were further substantiated by the supportive study APV20003; however, a different dosage \nregimen than that of study APV29005 was used. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter oral administration, fosamprenavir is rapidly and almost completely hydrolysed to amprenavir \nand inorganic phosphate prior to reaching the systemic circulation. The conversion of fosamprenavir \nto amprenavir appears to primarily occur in the gut epithelium. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of amprenavir following co-administration of Telzir with ritonavir \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV-infected patients and no substantial differences \nwere observed between these two groups. \n \nTelzir tablet and oral suspension formulations, both given fasted, delivered equivalent plasma \namprenavir AUC\u221e values and the Telzir oral suspension formulation delivered a 14 % higher plasma \namprenavir Cmax as compared to the oral tablet formulation. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter single dose administration of fosamprenavir, amprenavir peak plasma concentrations are \nobserved approximately 2 hours after administration. Fosamprenavir AUC values are, in general, less \nthan 1 % of those observed for amprenavir. The absolute bioavailability of fosamprenavir in humans \nhas not been established. \n \nAfter multiple dose oral administration of equivalent fosamprenavir and amprenavir doses, \ncomparable amprenavir AUC values were observed; however, Cmax values were approximately 30 % \nlower and Cmin values were approximately 28 % higher with fosamprenavir.  \n \nCo-administration of ritonavir with fosamprenavir increase plasma amprenavir AUC by approximately \n2-fold and plasma C\u03c4,ss by 4- to 6-fold, compared to values obtained when fosamprenavir is \nadministered alone. \n \nAfter multiple dose oral administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, \namprenavir was rapidly absorbed with a geometric mean (95 % CI) steady state peak plasma \namprenavir concentration (Cmax) of 6.08 (5.38-6.86) \u00b5g/ml occurring approximately 1.5 (0.75-5.0) \nhours after dosing (tmax). The mean steady state plasma amprenavir trough concentration (Cmin) was \n2.12 (1.77-2.54) \u00b5g/ml and AUC0-tau was 39.6 (34.5\u201345.3) h*\u00b5g/ml. \n \nAdministration of the fosamprenavir tablet formulation in the fed state (standardised high fat meal: \n967 kcal, 67 grams fat, 33 grams protein, 58 grams carbohydrate) did not alter plasma amprenavir \npharmacokinetics (Cmax, tmax or AUC0-\u221e) compared to the administration of this formulation in the \nfasted state. Telzir tablets may be taken without regard to food intake. \n \nCo-administration of amprenavir with grapefruit juice was not associated with clinically significant \nchanges in plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of amprenavir following administration of Telzir is approximately \n430 l (6 l/kg assuming a 70 kg body weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with \npenetration of amprenavir freely into tissues beyond the systemic circulation. This value is decreased \nby approximately 40 % when Telzir is co-administered with ritonavir, most likely due to an increase in \namprenavir bioavailability. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the protein binding of amprenavir is approximately 90 %. It is bound to the alpha-1-\nacid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin,but has a higher affinity for AAG. Concentrations of AAG have \nbeen shown to decrease during the course of antiretroviral therapy. This change will decrease the total \n\n\n\n29 \n\nactive substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which is \nthe active moiety, is likely to be unchanged. \n \nCSF penetration of amprenavir is negligible in humans. Amprenavir appears to penetrate into semen, \nthough semen concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFosamprenavir is rapidly and almost completely hydrolysed to amprenavir and inorganic phosphate as \nit is absorbed through the gut epithelium, following oral administration. Amprenavir is primarily \nmetabolised by the liver with less than 1 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The primary route of \nmetabolism is via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Amprenavir metabolism is inhibited by \nritonavir, via inhibition of CYP3A4, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of amprenavir. \nAmprenavir in addition is also an inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme, although to a lesser extent than \nritonavir. Therefore medicinal products that are inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be \nused with caution when administered concurrently with Telzir with ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing administration of Telzir, the half-life of amprenavir is 7.7 hours. When Telzir is \nco-administered with ritonavir, the half-life of amprenavir is increased to 15 \u2013 23 hours. \nThe primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism with less than 1 % excreted \nunchanged in the urine and no detectable amprenavir in faeces. Metabolites account for approximately \n14 % of the administered amprenavir dose in the urine, and approximately 75 % in the faeces. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatrics \n \nIn a clinical study on pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir in paediatric patients, eight subjects 12 to 18 \nyears of age received the standard fosamprenavir adult tablet dose of 700 mg twice daily (with \nritonavir 100 mg twice daily). Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir / \nritonavir 700 / 100 mg twice daily, 12 to 18 year old subjects had 20 % lower plasma APV AUC(0-\n24), 23 % lower Cmax, and 20 % lower Cmin values. Children 6 to 11 years of age  (n=9) receiving \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir 18 / 3 mg/kg twice daily had 26 % higher AUC(0-24) and similar Cmax and \nCmin values when compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 / \n100 mg twice daily. \n \nAPV20002 is a 48 week, Phase II, open label study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, \ntolerability and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with and without ritonavir in paediatric subjects 4 \nweeks to < 2 years of age. Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir with \nritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily, a subset of five pediatric subjects ages 6 to < 24-months \nreceiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 45/7 mg/kg twice daily demonstrated that despite an approximate \n5-fold increase in fosamprenavir and ritonavir doses on a mg/kg basis, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-\u03c4) \nwas approximately 48 % lower, Cmax 26 % lower, and C\u03c4 29 % lower in the paediatric subjects. No \ndosing recommendations can be made for the very young (children < 2 years of age) and Telzir with \nritonavir is not recommended for this patient population (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in patients \nover 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPatients with renal impairment have not been specifically studied. Less than 1 % of the therapeutic \ndose of amprenavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, \ntherefore the impact of renal impairment on amprenavir and ritonavir elimination should be minimal \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFosamprenavir is converted in man to amprenavir. The principal route of amprenavir and ritonavir \nelimination is hepatic metabolism. \n \nThe plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a 14 day repeat-dose study in HIV-1 \ninfected adult subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment receiving fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir compared to matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. \n \nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 5-6), the dosage regimen of \nfosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily \nprovided slightly higher plasma amprenavir Cmax (17 %), slightly higher plasma amprenavir \nAUC(0-12) (22 %), similar plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 117 % higher \nplasma unbound amprenavir C12 values compared to subjects with normal hepatic function receiving \nthe standard fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 mg /100 mg twice daily regimen.  \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9), a reduced dose of \nfosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is \npredicted to deliver similar plasma amprenavir Cmax and AUC(0-12), but approximately 35 % lower \nplasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88 % higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 \nvalues than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. Predicted exposures are based on extrapolation \nfrom data observed following administration of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with ritonavir \n100 mg once daily in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nIn subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-13), a reduced dose of \nfosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily \ndelivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but \nsimilar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. \nDespite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% \nhigher ritonavir Cmax, 40% higher ritonavir AUC(0-24), and 38% higher ritonavir C12 than achieved in \nsubjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / \n100 mg twice daily regimen.   \n \nFosamprenavir with ritonavir was generally well-tolerated in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe \nhepatic impairment, and these regimens had similar adverse event and clinical laboratory profiles as \nprevious studies of HIV-1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function. \n \nPregnancy \n \nAmprenavir (APV) pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women receiving FPV/RTV 700/100 \nmg twice daily during the second trimester (n=6) or third trimester (n=9) and postpartum. APV \nexposure was 25-35% lower during pregnancy. APV geometric mean (95% CI) and Ctau values were \n1.31 (0.97, 1.77), 1.34 (0.95, 1.89), and 2.03 (1.46, 2.83) \u00b5g/mL for the second trimester, third \ntrimester, and postpartum, respectively and within the range of values in non-pregnant patients on the \nsame FPV/RTV containing regimens.  \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nToxicity was similar to that of amprenavir and occurred at amprenavir plasma exposure levels below \nhuman exposure after treatment with fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir at the recommended \ndose. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in adult rats and dogs, fosamprenavir produced evidence of \ngastrointestinal disturbances (salivation, vomiting and soft to liquid faeces), and hepatic changes \n(increased liver weights, raised serum liver enzyme activities and microscopic changes, including \nhepatocyte necrosis). Toxicity was not aggravated when juvenile animals were treated as compared \nwith adult animals, but the data did indicate a steeper dose response. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with fosamprenavir in rats, male fertility was not affected. In females, \nat the high dose, there was a reduction in the weight of gravid uterus (0 to 16%) probably due to a \nreduction of the number of ovarian corporea lutea and implantations. In pregnant rats and rabbits there \nwere no major effects on embryo-foetal development. However, the number of abortions increased. In \nrabbits, systemic exposure at the high dose level was only 0.3 times human exposure at the maximum \nclinical dose and thus the developmental toxicity of fosamprenavir has not been fully determined. In \nrats exposed pre- and post-natally to fosamprenavir, pups showed impaired physical and functional \ndevelopment and reduced growth. Pup survival was decreased. In addition, decreased number of \nimplantation sites per litter and a prolongation of gestation were seen when pups were mated after \nreaching maturity. \n \nFosamprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. In \nlong-term carcinogenicity studies with fosamprenavir in mice and rats, there were increases in \nhepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in mice at exposure levels equivalent to 0.1 to \n0.3-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, and \nincreases in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats at exposure levels \nequivalent to 0.3 to 0.6-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir \ntwice daily. The relevance of the hepatocellular findings in the rodents for humans is uncertain; \nhowever, there is no evidence from clinical trials or marketed use to suggest that these findings are of \nclinical significance. Repeat dose studies with fosamprenavir in rats produced effects consistent with \nhepatic enzyme induction, which predisposes rats to thyroid neoplasms. The thyroid tumorigenic \npotential is regarded to be species-specific. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. In rats \nonly there was an increase in interstitial cell hyperplasia in males at exposure levels equivalent to 0.5-\nfold those in humans, and an increase in uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma in females at an \nexposure level equivalent to 1.1-fold those in humans. The incidence of endometrial findings was \nslightly increased over concurrent controls, but within background range for female rats. The \nrelevance of the uterine endometrial adenocarcinomas for humans is uncertain; however there is no \nevidence from clinical trials or marketed use to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTelzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is indicated for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 6 years and \nabove in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \n \nIn moderately antiretroviral experienced adults, Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir has not \nbeen shown to be as effective as lopinavir / ritonavir. No comparative studies have been undertaken in \nchildren or adolescents. \n \nIn heavily pretreated patients the use of Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir has not been \nsufficiently studied. \n \nIn protease inhibitor (PI) experienced patients, the choice of Telzir should be based on individual viral \nresistance testing and treatment history (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTelzir must only be given with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of amprenavir and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \nritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Telzir. \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nFosamprenavir is a pro-drug of amprenavir and must not be administered concomitantly with other \nmedicinal products containing amprenavir. \n \nThe importance of complying with the full recommended dosing regimen should be stressed to all \npatients. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nCaution is advised if the recommended dose of fosamprenavir with ritonavir detailed below are \nexceeded (see section 4.4). \n \nTelzir suspension is administered orally.  \n \nShake the bottle vigorously for 20 seconds before first dose is removed and 5 seconds before each \nsubsequent dose. \n \nTelzir is also available as 700 mg film-coated tablets. \n \nAdults \n \nIn adults, the oral suspension should be taken without food and on an empty stomach. \n \nPlease refer to the table below for the dosing recommendations in adults. \n \nPaediatric patients (from 6 years of age) \n \nIn paediatric patients, the oral suspension should be taken with food in order to aid palatability and \nassist compliance (see section 5.2). \n \nTelzir oral suspension is the recommended option for the most accurate dosing in children based on \nbody weight. \n \nPlease refer to the table below for the dosing recommendations in paediatric patients. \n \nNo dosing recommendations can be made for children weighing less than 25 kg. \n \nChildren less than 6 years of age \n \nTelzir with ritonavir is not recommended in children below 6 years due to insufficient data on \npharmacokinetics, safety and antiviral response (see section 5.2). \n \nDosing recommendations for Telzir with ritonavir \n \n\nAge  Body \nweight \n\nTelzir dose  \n(TWICE DAILY) \n \n\nRitonavir dose \n(TWICE DAILY) \n\nAdult \n(>18 \nyears) \n\n Tablet or Oral suspension  \n \n700 mg (1 tablet or 14 ml \nsuspension) \n \nOral suspension should be \ntaken without food \n\nCapsule or Solution \n \n100 mg  \n\n6-17 years >39 kg Tablet or Oral suspension  \n \n700 mg (1 tablet or 14 ml \nsuspension) \n \nOral suspension should be \ntaken with food \n\nCapsule or Solution \n \n100 mg \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n 33-38 kg Oral suspension \n \n18 mg/kg (0.36 ml/kg );  \nmaximum 700 mg or 14 ml \n \nOral suspension should be \ntaken with food \n\nCapsule or Solution \n \n100 mg \n\n25-32 kg Oral suspension \n \n18 mg/kg (0.36 ml/kg ) \n \nOral suspension should be \ntaken with food \n\nSolution \n \n3 mg/kg \n \n\n<25 kg No dosing recommendations \n \n\n \n\n<6 years  Not recommended \n \n\n \n\n \nElderly (over 65 years of age) \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir have not been studied in this patient population (see section \n5.2).  Therefore, no recommendations can be made in this patient population. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFor adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) the recommended dose is 700 mg \nfosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. \n \nFor adults with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) the recommended dose is \n450 mg fosamprenavir (i.e. 9 ml Telzir oral suspension) twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. \nThis adjusted dose has not been evaluated in a clinical study and has been derived from extrapolation \n(see section 5.2). \n \nFor adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 10-15): fosamprenavir should be used \nwith caution and at a reduced dose of 300 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once \ndaily.  \n \nOverall, even with these dose adjustments for adults with hepatic impairment, some patients may have \nhigher or lower than anticipated amprenavir and/or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to \npatients with normal hepatic function, due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), \ntherefore close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted. \n \nIn this patient population, the oral suspension should be taken without food and on an empty stomach. \n \nNo dose recommendation can be made for children and adolescents with hepatic impairment as no \nstudies have been conducted in these age groups. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to fosamprenavir, amprenavir, or ritonavir, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nTelzir must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, \nastemizole, bepridil, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, \nterfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), \noral triazolam, sildenafil used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (for use of \nsildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction, see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of the antipsychotic medicinal product lurasidone and fosamprenavir/ritonavir \n(FPV/RTV) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).   \n \nCo-administration of paritaprevir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV) is contraindicated due to \nthe expected increase of paritaprevir exposure and the lack of clinical data assessing the magnitude of \nthis increase (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Telzir with simvastatin or lovastatin is contraindicated because of increased \nplasma concentrations of lovastatin and simvastatin which can increase the risk of myopathy, \nincluding rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.5). \n \nTelzir with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic \nwindows that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism e.g. flecainide and propafenone (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCombination of rifampicin with Telzir with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHerbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking \nTelzir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of amprenavir \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n \nPatients should be advised that treatment with the Telzir, or any other current antiretroviral therapy, \ndoes not cure HIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV infection.  \n \nFosamprenavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between medicinal \nproducts in the sulphonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In the pivotal studies of Telzir, in \npatients receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir there was no evidence of an increased risk of rashes in \npatients with a history of sulphonamide allergy versus those who did not have a sulphonamide allergy. \nYet, Telzir should be used with caution in patients with a known sulphonamide allergy. \n \nThe Telzir oral suspension contains propyl and methyl parahydroxybenzoate. These products may \ncause an allergic reaction in some individuals. This reaction may be delayed. \n \nCo-administration of Telzir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily \nhas not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the \ncombination and therefore is not recommended. \n \n \nLiver disease \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nTelzir with ritonavir should be used with caution and at reduced doses in adults with mild, moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for \nthese medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nMedicinal products \u2013 interactions \n \nThe use of Telzir concomitantly with halofantrine or lidocaine (systemic) is not recommended. \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: The use of Telzir concomitantly with \nPDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nCo-administration of Telzir with low dose ritonavir and these medicinal products is expected to \nsubstantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.5). Note that co-administration of \nTelzir with low dose ritonavir with sildenafil used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \nis contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nA reduction in the rifabutin dosage by at least 75 % is recommended when administered with Telzir \nwith ritonavir. Further dose reduction may be necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nBecause there may be an increased risk of hepatic transaminase elevations and hormonal levels may \nbe altered with co-administration of fosamprenavir, ritonavir and oral contraceptives, alternative non-\nhormonal methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing potential (see \nsection 4.5). \nNo data are available on the co-administration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir with oestrogens and/or \nprogestogens when used as hormonal replacement therapies. The efficacy and safety of these therapies \nwith fosamprenavir and ritonavir has not been established. \n \nAnticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be used with caution. Telzir may be less \neffective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these medicinal \nproducts concomitantly (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant medicinal products \n(cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin) when co-administered with Telzir (see section 4.5). \n \nTherapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine \nand nortriptyline) when co-administered with Telzir (see section 4.5). \n \nWhen warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are co-administered with Telzir a reinforced monitoring of \nINR (International normalised ratio) is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Telzir with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised \nby CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section \n4.5). \n \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nCo-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with other antineoplastics metabolised by CYP3A (for \nexample dasatinib, nilotinib, ibrutinib, vinblastine and everolimus) may increase concentrations of \nthese medicinal products, potentially increasing the risk of adverse events usually associated with \nthese agents. Please refer to the relevant product information for these medications (see section 4.5).   \n \nHepatitis C virus (HCV) Direct-Acting Antivirals: When hepatitis C virus direct-acting antiviral \n(DAA) drugs, which are metabolised by CYP3A4 or are inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4, are co-\nadministered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir, altered plasma concentrations of medications are expected \ndue to inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 enzyme activity (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nRash / cutaneous reactions \n \nMost patients with mild or moderate rash can continue Telzir. Appropriate antihistamines (e.g. \ncetirizine dihydrochloride) may reduce pruritus and hasten the resolution of rash. Severe and \nlife-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, were reported in less than 1% of \npatients included in the clinical development programme. Telzir should be permanently discontinued \nin case of severe rash, or in case of rash of moderate intensity with systemic or mucosal symptoms \n(see section 4.8). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors (PIs). In some \npatients administration of factor VIII was necessary. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment \nwith protease inhibitors was continued, or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be informed of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWhen fosamprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug \ninteraction profile may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. The \nfull prescribing information for ritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of \ntherapy with Telzir with ritonavir. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 but to a lesser extent than \nCYP3A4. Ritonavir induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and glucuronosyl transferase. \n \nAdditionally, both amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, and ritonavir are primarily \nmetabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, any medicinal products that either share this \nmetabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and \nritonavir. Similarily, administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir may modify the pharmacokinetics \nof other active substances that share this metabolic pathway. \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nUnless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir (i.e. 700/100 mg twice daily), and the interaction was assessed under steady-\nstate conditions where drugs were administered for 10 to 21 days, \n \n \n\nDrugs by Therapeutic Area Interaction \n \nGeometric mean change \n(%) \n \n(Possible mechanism) \n\nRecommendation \nconcerning co-\nadministration \n\nANTIRETROVIRAL \nMEDICINAL PRODUCTS \n \n\n  \n\nNon-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors: \n \n\n  \n\nEfavirenz  \n600 mg once daily  \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is observed. \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nNevirapine  \n200 mg twice daily  \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is observed. \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n \n\nEtravirine \n \n \n(Study conducted in 8 \npatients) \n\nAmprenavir AUC \u2191\u2191 69% \nAmprenavir Cmin \u2191 77% \nAmprenavir Cmax \u2191 62% \n \nEtravirine AUC \u2194a \nEtravirine Cmin\u2194a \nEtravirine Cmax\u2194a \n \n\n a Comparison based on \nhistoric control. \n\nTelzir may require dose \nreduction (using oral \nsuspension). \n\nNucleoside / Nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase \ninhibitors: \n \n\n  \n\nAbacavir \nLamivudine  \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\n\n\n40 \n\nZidovudine  \n \nStudy performed with \namprenavir. \n \nNo FPV/RTV drug \ninteraction studies. \n \n\n  \n\nDidanosine chewable tablet \n \nNo drug interaction studies. \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n \n\nNo dose separation or dosage \nadjustment necessary (see \nAntacids).  \n \n \n\nDidanosine gastro-resistant \ncapsule \n \nNo drug interaction studies. \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction is expected. \n \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nTenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg once daily \n \n\nNo clinically significant \ninteraction observed. \n \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\n \n \n\nProtease Inhibitors: \nAccording to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally \nnot recommended. \nLopinavir / ritonavir \n400 mg/100 mg  \ntwice daily  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLopinavir / ritonavir \n533 mg/133 mg twice daily  \n \n \n(Telzir 1400 mg twice daily) \n \n\nLopinavir: Cmax \u2191 30% \nLopinavir: AUC \u2191 37% \nLopinavir: Cmin \u2191 52% \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2193 58% \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2193 63% \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2193 65% \n \nLopinavir: Cmax \u2194* \nLopinavir: AUC \u2194* \nLopinavir: Cmin \u2194* \n* compared to lopinavir / \nritonavir 400 mg/100 mg \ntwice daily \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2193 13%* \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2193 26%* \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2193 42 %* \n* compared to fosamprenavir \n/ ritonavir 700 mg/100 mg \ntwice daily  \n \n(Mixed CYP3A4 \ninduction/inhibition, Pgp \ninduction) \n\nConcomitant use is not \nrecommended. \n \n\nIndinavir \nSaquinavir \n \n\n No dose recommendations \ncan be given. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nNo drug interaction studies.  \n \nAtazanavir \n \n300 mg once daily  \n \n \n\nAtazanavir: Cmax \u2193 24%* \nAtazanavir: AUC \u2193 22%*  \nAtazanavir: Cmin\u2194* \n *compared to atazanavir/ \nritonavir 300 mg/ 100 mg \nonce daily  \n \nAmprenavir: Cmax \u2194 \nAmprenavir: AUC \u2194 \nAmprenavir: Cmin \u2194 \n \n\nNo dosage adjustment \nnecessary. \n\nIntegrase inhibitors \n \nRaltegravir \n \n400 mg twice daily \n\nFasting state \n \nAmprenavir :  \nCmax \u2193 14% (-36%; +15%) \nAUC \u2193 16% (-36%; +8%) \nCmin \u2193 19% (-42%; +13%)  \n \nRaltegravir: \nCmax \u2193 51% (-75%; -3%) \nAUC \u2193 55% (-76%; -16%) \nCmin \u2193 36 % (-57%; -3%)  \n \nFed state \n \nAmprenavir: \nCmax \u2193 25% (-41%; -4%) \nAUC \u2193 25% (-42%; -3%) \nCmin \u2193 33% (-50%; -10%)  \n \nRaltegravir:  \nCmax \u2193 56% (-70%; -34%) \nAUC \u2193 54% (-66%; -37%) \nCmin \u2193 54 % (-74%; -18%)  \n \n\nConcomitant use is not \nrecommended.

Placental transfer of amprenavir has been shown to occur in humans. \n \nIn animal studies at systemic plasma exposures (AUC) to amprenavir lower than therapeutic exposure \nin patients treated with Telzir, some developmental toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). In view of \nthe low exposure in reproductive toxicity studies, the potential developmental toxicity of Telzir has \nnot been fully determined. \n \nTelzir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAmprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir is excreted \nin human milk. Rat pups exposed pre and post-natally to amprenavir and fosamprenavir showed \ndevelopmental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nIt is recommended that HIV-infected women must not breast-feed under any circumstances to avoid \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of fosamprenavir on fertility are available. In rats, there was no major \neffect on fertillty or reproductive performance with fosamprenavir (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nNo studies on the effects of Telzir in combination with ritonavir on the ability to drive and use \nmachines have been performed. The adverse reaction profile of Telzir should be borne in mind when \nconsidering the patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIt should be noted that the Telzir oral suspension has not been evaluated clinically in adults and that \nthe adverse reaction profile detailed in this section is based on the experience in adults with the Telzir \nfilm coated tablets. \n \nSummary of safety profile \n\nThe adverse reaction profile was similar across all the respective adult studies: antiretroviral na\u00efve \npatients (APV30002, ESS100732), protease inhibitor experienced (twice daily dosing, APV30003) \npatients. This is based on safety data from a total of 864 patients exposed to fosamprenavir/ritonavir in \nthese three studies. \n \nThe most frequently (> 5% of adult subjects treated) reported adverse reactions with \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir combination were gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal \npain and vomiting) and headache. Most adverse reactions  associated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir \ncombination therapies were mild to moderate in severity, early in onset and rarely treatment limiting. \nMore serious adverse reactions such as serious skin rashes and hepatic transaminase elevations have \nalso been reported (cf paragraph Description of selected adverse reactions). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: Very common (\u2265 1/10), Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or Very rare (< 1/10,000), or Not known. \n \nFrequency categories for the reactions below have been based on clinical trials and postmarketing \ndata. \n \nMost of the adverse reactions below were reported from three large clinical studies in adults, where \nthe adverse events were of at least moderate intensity (Grade 2 or more) occurring in at least 1% of \npatients and reported by investigators as being attributable to the medicinal products used in the \nstudies.  \n \n\nBody System Adverse reaction Frequency \n \nNervous system disorders \n \n\n \nHeadache, dizziness, oral \nparaesthesia \n \n\n \nCommon \n\n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \nDiarrhoea \n\n \nVery common \n\n  \nLoose stools, nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain \n\n \nCommon \n\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\n \nStevens Johnson syndrome \n \nAngioedema \n \nRash (see text below \n\u201crash/cutaneous reactions\u201d) \n \n\n \nRare \n \nUncommon \n \nCommon \n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\n \nFatigue \n\n \nCommon \n\nInvestigations Blood cholesterol increased \n \nBlood triglycerides increased \n \nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased \n \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased \n \nLipase increased \n\nVery common \n \nCommon \n \nCommon \n \n \nCommon \n \n \nCommon \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nRash / cutaneous reactions: erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or without \npruritus, may occur during therapy. The rash generally will resolve spontaneously without the \nnecessity of discontinuing treatment with the fosamprenavir with ritonavir. \n \nSevere or life-threatening cases of rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome are rare. Fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir therapy should be definitively stopped in case of severe rash or in case of rash of mild or \nmoderate intensity associated with systemic or mucosal signs (see section 4.4). \n \nClinical chemistry abnormalities: clinical chemistry abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) potentially related to \ntreatment with fosamprenavir with ritonavir and reported in greater than or equal to 1 % of adult \npatients, included:  \nincreased ALT (common), AST (common), serum lipase (common) and triglycerides (common).  \n \nMetabolic parameters: weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral \ntherapy (see section 4.4). \n \nRhabdomyolysis: an increase in CPK, myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis, have been \nreported with protease inhibitors, more specifically in association with nucleoside analogues. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic \nor residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) have \nalso been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset \nis more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally \nacknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of \nthis is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric / other populations \n\nChildren and adolescents: the adverse reaction profile in children and adolescents is based on \nintegrated safety data from two studies (APV29005 Week 24 data and APV20003 Week 168 data \n[final data]) in which 158 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 18 years of age received fosamprenavir with \nritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1 for \n\n\n\n53 \n\ninformation on dosing regimens applied for each age group). 79 % of subjects received greater than 48 \nweeks of exposure. \nOverall the safety profile in these 158 children and adolescents was similar to that observed in the \nadult population. Vomiting occurred more frequently amongst paediatric patients. Drug-related \nadverse reactions were more common in APV20003 (57%) where subjects received once daily \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir when compared to APV29005 (33%) where subjects received twice daily \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir. \nNo new safety concerns were identified from analyses of 48 week data from studies APV29005 or \nAPV20002, in which 54 subjects 4 weeks to <2 years of age received twice daily fosamprenavir / \nritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy and 5 subjects received \nonly single doses of fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir. \n \nHaemophiliac patients: there have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac \npatients receiving antiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for Telzir. It is not known whether amprenavir can be removed by \nperitoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence \nof toxicity (see section 4.8) and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitor, ATC Code: J05AE07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity observed with fosamprenavir is due to the presence of trace amounts of \namprenavir. Amprenavir is a competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the \nactive site of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-\npol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral \nparticles. \n \nAdministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily results in \nplasma amprenavir concentrations (data from study APV30003 in antiretroviral experienced patients) \nwhich results in protein adjusted median ratios of Cmin/IC50 and Cmin/IC95 of 21.7 (range 1.19-240) and \n3.21 (range 0.26-30.0), respectively. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and \nchronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood \nlymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 \u00b5M in \nacutely infected cells and was 0.41 \u00b5M in chronically infected cells (1 \u00b5M = 0.50 \u00b5g/ml). The \nrelationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication \nin humans has not been defined. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n54 \n\nResistance \n \nIn vivo \n \n\na)ART-na\u00efve or PI-na\u00efve patients \n \nVarious regimens have been assessed in the amprenavir/fosamprenavir development programs with \nand without co-administration of ritonavir. Analysis of the virological failure samples across these \nregimens defined four main resistance pathways: V32I+I47V, I50V, I54L/M and I84V.  Additional \nmutations observed which may contribute to resistance were: L10V/F/R, I13V, K20R/T, L33F/V, \nM36I, M46I/L, I47V/L Q58E, I62V, L63P, V77I, I85V, and I93L.   \n\n \nWhen ART na\u00efve adult patients were treated with the currently approved doses of \nfosamprenavir/ritonavir, as for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were \ninfrequently observed. Sixteen of 434 ART-na\u00efve patients who received fosamprenavir 700 \nmg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 \nisolates genotyped. Three of 14 isolates had protease resistance mutations. One resistance mutation \nwas observed in each of 3 isolates: K20K/R, I54I/L and I93I/L respectively  \n \nAmong the 81 PI-na\u00efve paediatric patients treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir, 15 patients met \nprotocol-defined virological failure through 48 weeks in APV29005 and up to 108 weeks in \nAPV20003.  Treatment-emergent major or APV-associated protease mutations were observed in virus \nisolated from 2 patients. Resistance patterns were similar to those observed in adults. \n \n b) PI-experienced patients \n \nAmprenavir  \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced adult patients, PRO30017 (amprenavir 600 mg / ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily in sub-study A and B with 80 and 37 patients respectively), the following mutations \nemerged in patients with virological failure: L10F/I/V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, \nM46I/L, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/M/T/V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/I, I84V, I85V, \nL90M and I93L/M. \n \nFosamprenavir \n \nIn the studies of PI-experienced adult patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 \n(fosamprenavir 700 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in \npatients experiencing virological failure through 96 weeks: L10F/I, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, \nI47V, I50V, I54L/M/S, A71I/T/V, G73S, V82A, I84V, and L90M.  \n \nIn the paediatric studies APV20003 and APV29005, 77 PI-experienced patients were treated with \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir-based regimens and 43 patients met study-defined virologic failure criteria \nthrough 48 weeks in APV29005 and up to 108 weeks in APV20003. Treatment-emergent major \nprotease or APV-associated mutations were observed in virus isolated from 1 patient in APV29005 \nand 6 patients from APV20003.  The mutational profiles were similar to those described for \nPI-experienced adults treated with fosamprenavir / ritonavir. \n \nAntiviral activity according to genotypic/phenotypic resistance \n \nGenotypic resistance testing \n \nGenotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates. The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 \nalgorithm for fosamprenavir / ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations \nV32I+I47A/V, or I50V, or at least four mutations among: L10F/I/V, L33F, M36I, I54A/L/M/S/T/V, \n\n\n\n55 \n\nI62V, V82A/C/F/G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance). \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nPhenotypic resistance testing \n \nClinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic \ndata to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI-\nresistant isolates.  Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs \nfor FPV/RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results. \n \nClinical experience \n \nClinical experience with fosamprenavir boosted with ritonavir is mainly based on two open label \nstudies, one in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients (study ESS100732), and one study in antiretroviral \nexperienced patients (study APV30003). Both of these studies compared fosamprenavir/ritonavir with \nlopinavir / ritonavir. \n \nAntiretroviral Na\u00efve Adult Patients \n \nIn a randomised open-label study (ESS100732 - KLEAN) in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients, \nfosamprenavir (700 mg) co-administered with low dose ritonavir (100 mg) in a twice daily regimen \nincluding abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg) fixed dose combination tablet once daily showed \ncomparable efficacy over 48 weeks to lopinavir / ritonavir (400 mg / 100 mg) given twice daily in \ncombination with abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg once daily). \n \nNon-inferiority was demonstrated between fosamprenavir co-administered with ritonavir and lopinavir \n/ ritonavir based on the proportions of patients achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 400 copies/ml at \n48 weeks (primary endpoint). In the Time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) analysis for the \nITT(E) population, the proportion of patients achieving <400 copies/ml was 73 % (315 / 434) in the \nfosamprenavir with ritonavir group compared to 71 % (317 / 444) of patients receiving lopinavir / \nritonavir, with a 95 % confidence interval of the difference of [-4,84%; 7;05%].  \n \nEfficacy outcomes by subgroups are described in the table below. \n \nTable 1   Efficacy Outcome at Week 48 in ESS100732 (ART-Na\u00efve Patients) \n\n FPV/RTV 700 mg/100 mg \nBID (n= 434) \n\nLPV/RTV 400 mg/100 mg BID \n(n=444) \n\nITT-E Population \nTLOVR analysis \n\nProportion with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml \n\nAll Subjects 72.5 % 71.4% \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA \n < 100,000 copies/ml \n\n69.5 % (n=197) 69.4% (n=209) \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA \n \u2265 100,000 copies/ml \n\n75.1% (n=237) 73.2% (n=235) \n\n Proportion with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml \n\n\n\n56 \n\nAll Subjects 66% 65% \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA  \n< 100,000 copies/ml \n\n67% (n=197) 64% (n=209) \n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA  \n\u2265 100,000 copies/ml \n\n65% (n=237) 66% (n=235) \n\n Median Change from baseline in CD4 cells (cells/\u00b5l) \n\nITT-E observed \nanalysis \n\n176 (n=323) 191 (n=336) \n\n \nFollowing completion of the 48 week treatment period, subjects at European and Canadian sites were \neligible to participate in a study extension to Week 144 maintaining their treatment regimen as per the \noriginal randomisation.

Results were in favour of \nthe lopinavir / ritonavir arm as detailed below. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \nAll patients in this study had failed treatment with a previous protease inhibitor regimen (defined as \nplasma HIV-1 RNA that never went below 1,000 copies/ml after at least 12 consecutive weeks of \ntherapy, or initial suppression of HIV-1 RNA which subsequently rebounded to \u2265 1,000 copies/ml). \nHowever, only 65 % of patients were receiving a PI based regimen at study entry. \n \nThe population enrolled mainly consisted of moderately antiretroviral experienced patients. The \nmedian durations of prior exposure to NRTIs were 257 weeks for patients receiving fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir twice daily (79 % had \u2265 3 prior NRTIs) and 210 weeks for patients receiving \nlopinavir/ritonavir (64 % had \u2265 3 prior NRTIs). The median durations of prior exposure to protease \ninhibitors were 149 weeks for patients receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir twice daily (49 % \nreceived \u2265 2 prior PIs) and 130 weeks for patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (40 % received \n\u22652 prior PIs). \nThe mean AAUCMBs (log10 c/ml) in the ITT (E) population (Observed analysis) at 48 weeks (primary \nend-point) and other efficacy outcomes by subgroup are described in the tables below: \n \n \nTable 3   Efficacy at Week 48 Outcomes in APV30003 ITT(E) Population (ART-experienced \nPatients) \n\n FPV/RTV BID \n\n(N=107) \n\nLPV/RTV BID \n\n(N=103) \n\nAAUCMB Observed Analysis Mean (n) Mean (n) \n\nAll Patients -1.53 (105) -1.76 (103) \n\n     1000 \u2013 10,000 copies/ml -1.53 (41) -1.43 (43) \n\n     >10,000 \u2013 100,000 copies/ml -1.59 (45) -1.81 (46) \n\n     >100,000 copies/ml -1.38 (19) -2.61 (14) \n\nFPV/RTV BID vs LPV/RTV BID AAUCMB Mean Diff (97.5% CI) \n\nAll Patients 0.244 (-0.047, 0.536) \n\n     1000 \u2013 10,000 copies/ml -0.104 (-0.550, 0.342) \n\n     >10,000 \u2013 100,000 copies/ml 0.216 (-0.213, 0.664) \n\n     >100,000 copies/ml 1.232 (0.512, 1.952) \n\nAAUCMB Observed Analysis Mean (n) Mean (n) \n\nAll Patients -1.53 (105) -1.76 (103) \n\n         CD4-count    <50 -1.28 (7) -2.45 (8) \n\n                              \u226550 -1.55 (98) -1.70 (95) \n\n                              <200 -1.68 (32) -2.07 (38) \n\n                             \u2265 200  -1.46 (73) -1.58 (65) \n\n\n\n58 \n\n         GSS to OBT1       0 -1.42 (8) -1.91 (4) \n\n                                     1 -1.30 (35) -1.59 (23) \n\n                                   \u2265 2 -1.68 (62) -1.80 (76) \n\nAll Patients, RD=F Analysis2  n (%) n(%) \n\nSubjects (%) with plasma HIV-1 RNA \n<50 copies/ml \n\n49 (46%) 52 (50%) \n\nSubjects (%) with plasma HIV-1 RNA \n<400 copies/ml \n\n62 (58%) 63 (61%) \n\nSubjects with >1 log10 change from \nbaseline in plasma  HIV-\n1 RNA \n\n62 (58%) 71 (69%) \n\nChange from baseline in CD4 cells \n(cells/\u00b5l) \n\nMedian (n) Median (n) \n\nAll Patients 81 (79) 91 (85) \n\nKey: 1GSS to OBT: Genotypic Sensitivity Score to Optimised Background.

The benefit in \nthis age group has mainly been derived from study APV29005, an open label 48 week study \nevaluating the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with ritonavir \nadministered twice daily to HIV 1 protease inhibitor experienced and naive patients 2 to 18 years of \nage. Results through 48 weeks of treatment are provided below. \n \nAPV29005 enrolled 30 patients aged 6 to 11 (the majority of whom were treated with fosamprenavir / \nritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily or the adult tablet regimen) and 40 patients aged 12 to 18 (the \nmajority of whom were treated with the adult tablet regimen).  \n \nTable 5.

The conversion of fosamprenavir \nto amprenavir appears to primarily occur in the gut epithelium. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of amprenavir following co-administration of Telzir with ritonavir \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and HIV-infected patients and no substantial differences \nwere observed between these two groups. \n \nTelzir tablet and oral suspension formulations, both given fasted, delivered equivalent plasma \namprenavir AUC\u221e values and the Telzir oral suspension formulation delivered a 14 % higher plasma \namprenavir Cmax as compared to the oral tablet formulation. However, the bioequivalence could not be \ndemonstrated when the oral suspension was given with food. Therefore for adult patients the Telzir \noral suspension should be taken without food and on an empty stomach (see section 4.2). \n \nAbsorption \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nAfter single dose administration of fosamprenavir, amprenavir peak plasma concentrations are \nobserved approximately 2 hours after administration. Fosamprenavir AUC values are, in general, less \nthan 1 % of those observed for amprenavir. The absolute bioavailability of fosamprenavir in humans \nhas not been established. \n \nAfter multiple dose oral administration of equivalent fosamprenavir and amprenavir doses, \ncomparable amprenavir AUC values were observed; however, Cmax values were approximately 30 % \nlower and Cmin values were approximately 28 % higher with fosamprenavir.  \n \nCo-administration of ritonavir with fosamprenavir increase plasma amprenavir AUC by approximately \n2-fold and plasma C\u03c4,ss by 4- to 6-fold, compared to values obtained when fosamprenavir is \nadministered alone. \n \nAfter multiple dose oral administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, \namprenavir was rapidly absorbed with a geometric mean (95 % CI) steady state peak plasma \namprenavir concentration (Cmax) of 6.08 (5.38-6.86) \u00b5g/ml occurring approximately 1.5 (0.75-5.0) \nhours after dosing (tmax). The mean steady state plasma amprenavir trough concentration (Cmin) was \n2.12 (1.77-2.54) \u00b5g/ml and AUC0-tau was 39.6 (34.5\u201345.3) h*\u00b5g/ml. \n \nAdministration of the fosamprenavir oral suspension formulation with a high fat meal (967 kcal, \n67 grams fat, 33 grams protein, 58 grams carbohydrate) reduced plasma amprenavir AUC(0-\u221e) by \n28% and Cmax by 46% and delayed Tmax by 0.72 hours. For adult patients the fosamprenavir oral \nsuspension should be taken without food and on an empty stomach. In children and adolescents the \nfosamprenavir oral suspension should be taken with food. The dose recommendations for this \npopulation therefore take into account the observed food effect (see section 4.2). \n \nCo-administration of amprenavir with grapefruit juice was not associated with clinically significant \nchanges in plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of amprenavir following administration of Telzir is approximately \n430 l (6 l/kg assuming a 70 kg body weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with \npenetration of amprenavir freely into tissues beyond the systemic circulation. This value is decreased \nby approximately 40 % when Telzir is co-administered with ritonavir, most likely due to an increase in \namprenavir bioavailability. \n \nIn in vitro studies, the protein binding of amprenavir is approximately 90 %. It is bound to the alpha-1-\nacid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin, but has a higher affinity for AAG. Concentrations of AAG \nhave been shown to decrease during the course of antiretroviral therapy. This change will decrease the \ntotal active substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which \nis the active moiety, is likely to be unchanged. \n \nCSF penetration of amprenavir is negligible in humans. Amprenavir appears to penetrate into semen, \nthough semen concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFosamprenavir is rapidly and almost completely hydrolysed to amprenavir and inorganic phosphate as \nit is absorbed through the gut epithelium, following oral administration. Amprenavir is primarily \nmetabolised by the liver with less than 1 % excreted unchanged in the urine. The primary route of \nmetabolism is via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Amprenavir metabolism is inhibited by \nritonavir, via inhibition of CYP3A4, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of amprenavir. \nAmprenavir in addition is also an inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme, although to a lesser extent than \nritonavir. Therefore medicinal products that are inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be \nused with caution when administered concurrently with Telzir with ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nElimination \n \nFollowing administration of Telzir, the half-life of amprenavir is 7.7 hours. When Telzir is \nco-administered with ritonavir, the half-life of amprenavir is increased to 15 \u2013 23 hours. \nThe primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism with less than 1 % excreted \nunchanged in the urine and no detectable amprenavir in faeces. Metabolites account for approximately \n14 % of the administered amprenavir dose in the urine, and approximately 75 % in the faeces. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatrics \n \nIn a clinical study on pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir in paediatric patients, eight subjects 12 to 18 \nyears of age received the standard fosamprenavir adult tablet dose of 700 mg twice daily (with \nritonavir 100 mg twice daily). Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir / \nritonavir 700 / 100 mg twice daily, 12 to 18 year old subjects had 20 % lower plasma APV AUC(0-\n24), 23 % lower Cmax, and 20 % lower Cmin values. Children 6 to 11 years of age (n=9) receiving \nfosamprenavir / ritonavir 18 / 3 mg/kg twice daily had 26 % higher AUC(0-24) and similar Cmax and \nCmin values when compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 / \n100 mg twice daily. \n \nAPV20002 is a 48 week, Phase II, open label study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, \ntolerability and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with and without ritonavir in paediatric subjects 4 \nweeks to < 2 years of age. Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir with \nritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily, a subset of five pediatric subjects ages 6 to < 24-months \nreceiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 45/7 mg/kg twice daily demonstrated that despite an approximate \n5-fold increase in fosamprenavir and ritonavir doses on a mg/kg basis, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-\u03c4) \nwas approximately 48 % lower, Cmax 26 % lower, and C\u03c4 29 % lower in the paediatric subjects. No \ndosing recommendations can be made for the very young (children < 2 years of age) and Telzir with \nritonavir is not recommended for this patient population (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in patients \nover 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPatients with renal impairment have not been specifically studied. Less than 1 % of the therapeutic \ndose of amprenavir is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, \ntherefore the impact of renal impairment on amprenavir and ritonavir elimination should be minimal \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFosamprenavir is converted in man to amprenavir. The principal route of amprenavir and ritonavir \nelimination is hepatic metabolism. \n \nThe plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a 14 day repeat-dose study in HIV-1 \ninfected adult subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment receiving fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir compared to matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. \n \nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 5-6), the dosage regimen of \nfosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily \nprovided slightly higher plasma amprenavir Cmax (17 %), slightly higher plasma amprenavir \nAUC(0-12) (22 %), similar plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 117 % higher \n\n\n\n62 \n\nplasma unbound amprenavir C12 values compared to subjects with normal hepatic function receiving \nthe standard fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 mg /100 mg twice daily regimen.  \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9), a reduced dose of \nfosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is \npredicted to deliver similar plasma amprenavir Cmax and AUC(0-12), but approximately 35 % lower \nplasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88 % higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 \nvalues than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir \nwith ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. Predicted exposures are based on extrapolation \nfrom data observed following administration of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with ritonavir \n100 mg once daily in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nIn subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-13), a reduced dose of \nfosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily \ndelivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but \nsimilar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. \nDespite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% \nhigher ritonavir Cmax, 40% higher ritonavir AUC(0-24), and 38% higher ritonavir C12 than achieved in \nsubjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / \n100 mg twice daily regimen.   \n \nFosamprenavir with ritonavir was generally well-tolerated in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe \nhepatic impairment, and these regimens had similar adverse event and clinical laboratory profiles as \nprevious studies of HIV-1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function. \n \nPregnancy \n \nAmprenavir (APV) pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women receiving FPV/RTV 700/100 \nmg twice daily during the second trimester (n=6) or third trimester (n=9) and postpartum. APV \nexposure was 25-35% lower during pregnancy. APV geometric mean (95% CI) and Ctau values were \n1.31 (0.97, 1.77), 1.34 (0.95, 1.89), and 2.03 (1.46, 2.83) \u00b5g/mL for the second trimester, third \ntrimester, and postpartum, respectively and within the range of values in non-pregnant patients on the \nsame FPV/RTV containing regimens.  \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicity was similar to that of amprenavir and occurred at amprenavir plasma exposure levels below \nhuman exposure after treatment with fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir at the recommended \ndose. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in adult rats and dogs, fosamprenavir produced evidence of \ngastrointestinal disturbances (salivation, vomiting and soft to liquid faeces), and hepatic changes \n(increased liver weights, raised serum liver enzyme activities and microscopic changes, including \nhepatocyte necrosis). Toxicity was not aggravated when juvenile animals were treated as compared \nwith adult animals, but the data did indicate a steeper dose response. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with fosamprenavir in rats, male fertility was not affected. In females, \nat the high dose, there was a reduction in the weight of gravid uterus (0 to 16%) probably due to a \nreduction of the number of ovarian corporea lutea and implantations. In pregnant rats and rabbits there \nwere no major effects on embryo-foetal development. However, the number of abortions increased. In \nrabbits, systemic exposure at the high dose level was only 0.3 times human exposure at the maximum \nclinical dose and thus the development toxicity of fosamprenavir has not been fully determined. In rats \nexposed pre- and post-natally to fosamprenavir, pups showed impaired physical and functional \ndevelopment and reduced growth. Pup survival was decreased. In addition, decreased number of \n\n\n\n63 \n\nimplantation sites per litter and a prolongation of gestation were seen when pups were mated after \nreaching maturity. \n \nFosamprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. In \nlong-term carcinogenicity studies with fosamprenavir in mice and rats, there were increases in \nhepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in mice at exposure levels equivalent to 0.1 to \n0.3-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, and \nincreases in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats at exposure levels \nequivalent to 0.3 to 0.6-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir \ntwice daily. The relevance of the hepatocellular findings in the rodents for humans is uncertain; \nhowever, there is no evidence from clinical trials or marketed use to suggest that these findings are of \nclinical significance. Repeat dose studies with fosamprenavir in rats produced effects consistent with \nhepatic enzyme induction, which predisposes rats to thyroid neoplasms. The thyroid tumorigenic \npotential is regarded to be species-specific. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  In \nrats only there was an increase in interstitial cell hyperplasia in males at exposure levels equivalent to \n0.5-fold those in humans, and an increase in uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma in females at an \nexposure level equivalent to 1.1-fold those in humans. The incidence of endometrial findings was \nslightly increased over concurrent controls, but within background range for female rats. The \nrelevance of the uterine endometrial adenocarcinomas for humans is uncertain; however there is no \nevidence from clinical trials or marketed use to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n78 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTelzir 700 mg film-coated tablets \nFosamprenavir \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1.  What Telzir is and what it is used for \n2.  What you need to know before you take Telzir \n3.  How to take Telzir \n4.  Possible side effects \n5.       How to store Telzir \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Telzir is and what it is used for \n \nTelzir is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection.  \n  \nTelzir is a type of medicine known as an anti-retroviral.  It is taken with low doses of another \nmedicine, ritonavir, which boosts the level of Telzir in the blood. Telzir belongs to a group of \nanti-retroviral medicines called protease inhibitors.  Protease is an enzyme produced by HIV which \nenables the virus to multiply in white blood cells (CD4 cells) in your blood.  By stopping protease \nfrom working, Telzir stops HIV multiplying and infecting more CD4 cells.    \n \nTelzir with low doses of ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines \n(\u2018combination therapy\u2019) to treat adults, adolescents and children aged over 6 years infected with  \nHIV.     \n \nHIV can become resistant to anti-HIV medicines.  To avoid this happening, and to stop your illness \ngetting worse, it is very important that you keep taking all your medicines exactly as prescribed.  \n \nTelzir will not stop you passing on HIV.  HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone \nwho\u2019s got the infection, or by transfer of infected blood (for example by sharing needles).  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Telzir \n \nTelzir is to be taken in combination with low doses of ritonavir and other antiretroviral \nmedicines. It is therefore important that you carefully read the package leaflet provided with these \nmedicines. If you have any further questions about ritonavir or the other medicines prescribed, please \nask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nDo not take Telzir: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to fosamprenavir, amprenavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6), or to ritonavir. \n\u2022 if you are taking any of these medicines: \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n- alfuzosin (used to treat a prostate problem) \n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms \u2013 these medicines may be \n\navailable without prescription) \n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia)  \n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder)                                                         \n- lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder)  \n- cisapride (used to relieve indigestion) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine, flecainide and propafenone (heart medicines) \n- bepridil (used to treat high blood pressure) \n- oral midazolam or oral triazolam (used to treat anxiety)  \n- products containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)  \n- lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol)  \n- sildenafil if used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, (a condition affecting the blood \n\nvessels to your lungs) \n- paritaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C virus infection) \n\n \n \n\u2192Tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. \n \nTake special care with Telzir \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telzir:  \n\u2022 If you have a known allergy to medicines containing sulphonamide.  You may also be allergic \n\nto Telzir. \n\u2022 If you have liver disease.  Your doctor may lower your dose of Telzir and ritonavir depending on \n\nthe amount of liver damage. You will be monitored while you are taking Telzir. If your liver \ndisease gets worse, you may need to stop taking Telzir for a while, or permanently. People with \nhepatitis B or C taking combination therapy are at increased risk of getting severe liver problems.    \n\n\u2022 If you have haemophilia. Increased bleeding may occur while taking protease inhibitors (such as \nTelzir). The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control any \nbleeding. \n\n\u2022 If you have diabetes. In some patients taking antiretroviral medicines including protease \ninhibitors, there have been reports of increased sugar in the blood and diabetes getting worse. \nAlso, some people have become diabetic while taking these medicines. \n\n\u2022 If you are taking any other medicines.  See section \u2018Other medicines and Telzir\u2019. \n \n\u2192Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  You will need extra check-ups, including blood \ntests, while you\u2019re taking your medication.   \n \nYour doctor will monitor your blood glucose levels before and during treatment with Telzir. \n \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious.  \nThese include: \n\u2022 Flare up of old infections \n\u2022 Change in your body shape \n\u2022 Problems with your bones. \n\nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you\u2019re taking Telzir. \nPlease read the information on \u2018Other side effects of combination therapy for HIV\u2019 in section 4 \nof this leaflet.  If you have any questions about this information or the advice given: \n\u2192Talk to your doctor.  \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nYou may get a skin rash.  However you can still continue to take Telzir. It can be treated with \nantihistamines. Rarely, the skin rash can be severe and serious (Stevens Johnson syndrome). If this \nhappens, Telzir must be stopped immediately and you must never take it again. \n \nProtect other people.  HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, \nor by transfer of infected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV \nwhen taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with \nyour doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOther medicines and Telzir \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you\u2019re taking or have recently taken any other medicines \u2013 \nthese include herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription. Your doctor will \ndecide if these medicines are suitable for you to take with Telzir and ritonavir. This is very \nimportant, as Telzir or ritonavir can strengthen or weaken the effects of other medicines.  This can \nsometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that must not be taken with Telzir. You must check the list of medicines \nunder 'Don't take Telzir' at the beginning of section 2 of this leaflet.  \n \nThese medicines are not recommended with Telzir/ritonavir: \n\u2022 doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole greater than 200 mg per day (used to treat fungal \n\ninfections)  \n\u2022 doses of rifabutin greater than 150 mg every other day (an antibiotic) \n\u2022 lidocaine given by injection   \n\u2022 halofantrine (used to treat malaria) \n\u2022 sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction)  \n\u2022 doses of atorvastatin greater than 20 mg per day (used to lower cholesterol)  \n\u2022 fluticasone propionate and similar medicines used to treat asthma, unless considered essential. In \n\nthis case close monitoring is required. \n\u2022 lopinavir/ritonavir combination (used to treat HIV infection) \n\u2022 raltegravir (used to treat HIV infection) \n\u2022 , , simeprevir, daclatasvir (used to treat hepatitis C virus infection) \n\u2022 maraviroc (used to treat HIV infection) \n \nYou will be closely monitored if you are taking these medicines with Telzir/ritonavir: \n\u2022 atorvastatin up to 20 mg per day (used to lower cholesterol) \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy) \n\u2022 cyclosporin, rapamycin, tacrolimus (used to suppress the immune system) \n\u2022 dolutegravir (used to treat HIV infection) \n\u2022 desipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine and similar medicines (used to treat depression) \n\u2022 warfarin and other medicines that stop blood clotting \n\u2022 injectable midazolam (used to treat anxiety) \n\u2022 clarithromycin, erythromycin (an antibiotic) \n\u2022 methadone (a heroin substitute) \n\u2022 dasatinib, nilotinib, ibrutinib, vinblastine and everolimus  (used to treat several types of cancer) \n\n \nYour dose of Telzir may need to be changed if you are taking \n\u2022 etravirine (used to treat HIV infection) \n \nHormonal contraception \nTaking Telzir and ritonavir while taking the contraceptive pill may harm your liver and may stop the \ncontraceptive from working properly. \n\u2192 Use an alternative non-hormonal type of contraception such as a condom. \nNo studies have been done on the use of Telzir/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as \nhormone replacement therapy (HRT). \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nPregnancy  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby: \n\u2192Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast-feed because HIV infection can be passed on to the \nbaby in breast milk. It is not known whether the ingredients in Telzir can also pass into your breast \nmilk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n\u2192Talk to your doctor immediately.  \n \n \nDriving and using machines \nTelzir can make you feel dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n\u2192 Don\u2019t drive or operate machinery unless you\u2019re feeling well.  \n \nStay in regular contact with your doctor \nTelzir helps to control your condition, but it is not a cure for HIV infection.  You need to keep taking \nit every day to stop your illness getting worse.  You may still develop other infections and illnesses \nlinked to HIV infection. \n\u2192 Keep in touch with your doctor, and don\u2019t stop taking Telzir without your doctor\u2019s advice.   \n \n \n3.  How to take Telzir \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  It is very important \nthat you take the full daily dose of Telzir and ritonavir as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take \nmore than the recommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nSwallow the tablets whole, with some water or another drink.  Telzir tablets can be taken with or \nwithout food. Telzir is also available as a liquid (oral suspension) for people who are unable to \nswallow tablets. (Read the package leaflet of Telzir oral suspension for guidance on whether to take it \nwith or without food.) \n \nAdults  \nThe recommended dose is one 700 mg Telzir tablet twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily.  \n \nChildren from 6 years of age and weighing at least 39 kg \nChildren can take the adult tablet dose of one 700 mg Telzir tablet twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg \ntwice daily if they can swallow the tablets whole.   \n \nChildren from 6 years of age and weighing less than 39 kg \nUse Telzir oral suspension. \n \nAdults with liver disease  \nIf you have mild liver disease, the dose is one Telzir tablet (700 mg) twice daily with 100 mg \nritonavir only once daily.   If you have moderate or severe liver disease the dose of Telzir has to be \nlowered.  This dose adjustment cannot be made with Telzir tablets.  You must take Telzir oral \nsuspension.  \n \nIf you take too much Telzir  \nIf you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Telzir: \n\u2192Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Telzir \n\n\n\n82 \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of Telzir, take it as soon as you remember and then continue your \ntreatment as before. Don\u2019t take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nDon\u2019t stop Telzir without advice \nTake Telzir for as long as your doctor recommends.  Don\u2019t stop unless your doctor advises you to.  \n \n4. Possible side effects \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. When treating \nHIV, it can be hard to tell whether side effects are caused by Telzir, by other medicines taken at the \nsame time or by the HIV disease itself. For this reason, it is very important to talk to your doctor \nabout any changes in your health. \n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Increase in cholesterol (a type of blood fat). \n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 Increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat). \n\u2022 Feeling sick or being sick (nausea or vomiting), pain in the stomach, loose stools \n\u2022 Skin rashes (red, raised or itchy) \u2013 if the skin rash is severe, you may have to stop taking this \n\nmedicine \n\u2022 Headache, feeling dizzy \n\u2022 Feeling tired \n\u2022 Increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme \n\nproduced by the pancreas called lipase. \n\u2022 Tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth. \n\n \nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\u2022 Swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema). \n\n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\u2022 A severe or life-threatening skin reaction (Stevens Johnson syndrome). \n \nYou may experience muscle problems \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with antiretroviral \ntherapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions, these muscle \ndisorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  If you notice any muscle problems: \n\u2192Tell your doctor. \n \nHaemophiliacs may bleed more \nIn patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while \ntaking protease inhibitors.  \nIf this happens to you: \n\u2192Talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you get any side effects \n\n\n\n83 \n\n\u2192Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet.  \n \nOther side effects of combination therapy for HIV \n \nOld infections may flare up \nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections).  When these people start treatment, they may \nfind that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation.  These \nsymptoms are probably caused by the body\u2019s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body \nstarts to fight these infections. \n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nIf you get any symptoms of infection or signs of inflammation while you\u2019re taking Telzir: \n\u2192Tell your doctor immediately.  Don\u2019t take other medicines for the infection without your \n\ndoctor\u2019s advice.  \n \n \nYou may have problems with your bones \nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. \n\nPeople may be more likely to get this condition: \n\u2022 if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n\u2022 if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n\u2022 if they drink alcohol \n\u2022 if their immune systems are very weak \n\u2022 if they are overweight. \n\nSigns to look out for include: \n\u2022 stiffness in the joints \n\u2022 aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty moving. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n\u2192Tell your doctor. \n \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022    This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.  It may \n          harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1.  What Telzir is and what it is used for \n2.  What you need to know before you take Telzir \n3.  How to take Telzir \n4.  Possible side effects \n5.       How to store Telzir \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Telzir is and what it is used for \n \nTelzir is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection.  \n \nTelzir is a type of medicine known as an anti-retroviral.  It is taken with low doses of another \nmedicine, ritonavir, which boosts the level of Telzir in the blood. Telzir belongs to a group of \nanti-retroviral medicines called protease inhibitors.  Protease is an enzyme produced by HIV which \nenables the virus to multiply in white blood cells (CD4 cells) in your blood.  By stopping protease \nfrom working, Telzir stops HIV multiplying and infecting more CD4 cells \n \nTelzir with low doses of ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines \n(\u2018combination therapy\u2019) to treat adults, adolescents and children aged over 6 years infected with  \nHIV.      \n \nHIV can become resistant to anti-HIV medicines.  To avoid this happening, and to stop your illness \ngetting worse, it is very important that you keep taking all your medicines exactly as prescribed.  \n \nTelzir will not stop you passing on HIV.  HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone \nwho\u2019s got the infection, or by transfer of infected blood (for example by sharing needles).  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Telzir \n \nTelzir is to be taken in combination with low doses of ritonavir and other antiretroviral \nmedicines. It is therefore important that you carefully read the package leaflet provided with these \nmedicines. If you have any further questions about ritonavir or the other medicines prescribed, please \nask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nDo not take Telzir: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to fosamprenavir, amprenavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6), or to ritonavir. \n\n\u2022 if you are taking any of these medicines: \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n- alfuzosin (used to treat a prostate problem) \n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms \u2013 these medicines may be \n\navailable without prescription) \n- pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia)  \n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) \n- lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder)  \n- cisapride (used to relieve indigestion) \n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n- amiodarone, quinidine, flecainide and propafenone (heart medicines) \n- bepridil (used to treat high blood pressure) \n- oral midazolam or oral triazolam (used to treat anxiety)  \n- products containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n- lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol)  \n- sildenafil if used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, (a condition affecting the blood \n\nvessels to your lungs) \n- paritaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C virus infection) \n\n \n \n\u2192Tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. \n \nTake special care with Telzir \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telzir: \n\u2022 If you have a known allergy to medicines containing sulphonamide.  You may also be allergic \n\nto Telzir. \n\u2022 If you have liver disease. Your doctor may lower your dose of Telzir and ritonavir depending on \n\nthe amount of liver damage. You will be monitored while you are taking Telzir. If your liver \ndisease gets worse, you may need to stop taking Telzir for a while, or permanently. People with \nhepatitis B or C taking combination therapy are at increased risk of getting severe liver problems.  \n\n\u2022 If you have haemophilia. Increased bleeding may occur while taking protease inhibitors (such as \nTelzir). The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control any \nbleeding. \n\n\u2022 If you have diabetes. In some patients taking antiretroviral medicines including protease \ninhibitors, there have been reports of increased sugar in the blood and diabetes getting worse.  \nAlso, some people have become diabetic while taking these medicines. \n\n\u2022 If you are taking any other medicines.  See section \u2018Other medicines and Telzir\u2019. \n \n\u2192Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.   You will need extra check-ups, including blood \ntests, while you\u2019re taking your medication.   \n \nYour doctor will monitor your blood glucose levels before and during treatment with Telzir. \n \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious.  \nThese include: \n\u2022 Flare up of old infections \n\u2022 Change in your body shape \n\u2022 Problems with your bones. \n\nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you\u2019re taking Telzir. \nPlease read the information on \u2018Other side effects of combination therapy for HIV\u2019 in section 4 \nof this leaflet.  If you have any questions about this information or the advice given: \n\u2192Talk to your doctor.  \n \nYou may get a skin rash.  \n\n\n\n89 \n\nHowever you can still continue to take Telzir. It can be treated with antihistamines. Rarely, the skin \nrash can be severe and serious (Stevens Johnson syndrome). If this happens, Telzir must be stopped \nimmediately and you must never take it again. \n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of infected \nblood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions \nneeded to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOther medicines and Telzir \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you\u2019re taking or have recently taken any other medicines \u2013 \nthese include herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  \nYour doctor will decide if these medicines are suitable for you to take with Telzir and ritonavir.  This \nis very important, as Telzir or ritonavir can strengthen or weaken the effects of other medicines.  This \ncan sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  \n \nThere are some medicines that must not be taken with Telzir. You must check the list of medicines \nunder 'Don't take Telzir' at the beginning of section 2 of this leaflet.  \n \nThese medicines are not recommended with Telzir/ritonavir: \n- doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole greater than 200 mg per day (used to treat fungal \n\ninfections)  \n- doses of rifabutin greater than 150 mg every other day (an antibiotic) \n- lidocaine given by injection   \n- halofantrine  (used to treat malaria) \n- sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction)  \n- doses of atorvastatin greater than 20 mg per day (used to lower cholesterol)  \n- fluticasone propionate and similar medicines used to treat asthma, unless considered essential.

This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. When treating \nHIV, it can be hard to tell whether side effects are caused by Telzir, by other medicines taken at the \nsame time or by the HIV disease itself. For this reason, it is very important to talk to your doctor \nabout any changes in your health. \n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Increase in cholesterol (a type of blood fat).  \n\n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 Increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat). \n\u2022  Feeling sick or being sick (nausea or vomiting), pain in the stomach, loose stools \n\u2022 Skin rashes (red, raised or itchy) \u2013 if the skin rash is severe, you may have to stop taking this \n\nmedicine \n\u2022 Headache, feeling dizzy \n\u2022 Feeling tired \n\u2022 Increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme \n\nproduced by the pancreas called lipase. \n\u2022 Tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth. \n\n \nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\u2022 Swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema). \n\n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\u2022 A severe or life-threatening skin reaction (Stevens Johnson syndrome). \n \nYou may experience muscle problems \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with antiretroviral \ntherapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions, these muscle \ndisorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  If you notice any muscle problems: \n\u2192Tell your doctor. \n \nHaemophiliacs may bleed more \nIn patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nprotease inhibitors. If this happens to you: \n\u2192Talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you get any side effects \n\u2192Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet.  \n \nOther side effects of combination therapy for HIV \n \nOld infections may flare up \nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections).  When these people start treatment, they may \n\n\n\n93 \n\nfind that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation.  These \nsymptoms are probably caused by the body\u2019s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body \nstarts to fight these infections. \n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nIf you get any symptoms of infection or signs of inflammation while you\u2019re taking Telzir: \n\u2192Tell your doctor immediately.  Don\u2019t take other medicines for the infection without your \ndoctor\u2019s advice.  \n \n \nYou may have problems with your bones \nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. \n\nPeople may be more likely to get this condition: \n\u2022 if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n\u2022 if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n\u2022 if they drink alcohol \n\u2022 if their immune systems are very weak \n\u2022 if they are overweight. \n\nSigns to look out for include: \n\u2022 stiffness in the joints \n\u2022 aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty moving. \nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n\uf0e0Tell your doctor. \n \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Telzir \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.   \n \nDo not freeze.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what telzir is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "telzir is used to treat hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. telzir is a type of medicine known as an anti-retroviral. it is taken with low doses of another medicine, ritonavir, which boosts the level of telzir in the blood. telzir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called protease inhibitors. protease is an enzyme produced by hiv which enables the virus to multiply in white blood cells (cd4 cells) in your blood. by stopping protease from working, telzir stops hiv multiplying and infecting more cd4 cells. telzir with low doses of ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines ('combination therapy') to treat adults, adolescents and children aged over 6 years infected with hiv. hiv can become resistant to anti-hiv medicines. to avoid this happening, and to stop your illness getting worse, it is very important that you keep taking all your medicines exactly as prescribed. telzir will not stop you passing on hiv. hiv infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who's got the infection, or by transfer of infected blood (for example by sharing needles).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "telzir", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "telzir", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 0,

the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. when treating hiv, it can be hard to tell whether side effects are caused by telzir, by other medicines taken at the same time or by the hiv disease itself. for this reason, it is very important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. very common side effects these may affect more than 1 in 10 people: diarrhoea increase in cholesterol (a type of blood fat). common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people: increases in triglycerides (a type of blood fat). feeling sick or being sick (nausea or vomiting), pain in the stomach, loose stools skin rashes (red, raised or itchy) if the skin rash is severe, you may have to stop taking this medicine headache, feeling dizzy feeling tired increases in enzymes produced by the liver called transaminases, increases of an enzyme produced by the pancreas called lipase. tingling or numbness around the lips and mouth. uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people: swelling of the face, lips and tongue (angioedema). rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: a severe or life-threatening skin reaction (stevens johnson syndrome). you may experience muscle problems there have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness,

problems: \u2192tell your doctor. haemophiliacs may bleed more in patients with haemophilia type a and b, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking protease inhibitors. if this happens to you: \u2192talk to your doctor immediately. if you get any side effects 83 \u2192talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. other side effects of combination therapy for hiv old infections may flare up people with advanced hiv infection (aids) have weak immune systems and are more likely to develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). when these people start treatment, they may find that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. these symptoms are probably caused by the body's immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these infections. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. if you get any symptoms of infection or signs of inflammation while you're taking telzir: \u2192tell your doctor immediately. don't take other medicines for the infection without your doctor's advice. you may have problems with your bones some people taking combination therapy for hiv develop a condition called osteonecrosis. with this condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. people may be more likely to get this condition: if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids if they drink alcohol if their immune systems are very weak if they are overweight. signs to look out for include: stiffness in the joints aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) difficulty moving. if you notice any of these symptoms: \u2192tell your doctor. reporting of side effects
