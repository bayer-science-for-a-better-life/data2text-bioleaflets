NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 10 mg of fampridine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet. \n \nAn off-white, film coated, oval biconvex 13 x 8 mm tablet with flat edge debossed with A10 on one \nside. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFampyra is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with \nwalking disability (EDSS 4-7). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Fampyra is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of MS. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (one tablet in the \nmorning and one tablet in the evening). Fampyra should not be administered more frequently or at \nhigher doses than recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets should be taken without food \n(see section 5.2). \n \nStarting and Evaluating Fampyra Treatment \n \n• Initial prescription should be limited to two to four weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should \n\ngenerally be identified within two to four weeks after starting Fampyra \n• An assessment of walking ability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) or Twelve Item \n\nMultiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), is recommended to evaluate improvement \nwithin two to four weeks. If no improvement is observed, Fampyra should be discontinued \n\n• Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. \n \nRe-Evaluating Fampyra Treatment \n \nIf decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in \norder to reassess the benefits of Fampyra (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal of \nFampyra and performing an assessment of walking ability. Fampyra should be discontinued if patients \nno longer receive walking benefit. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMissed Dose \nThe usual dosing regimen should always be followed. A double dose should not be taken if a dose is \nmissed. \n \nElderly \nRenal function should be checked in the elderly before starting treatment with Fampyra. Monitoring \nrenal function to detect any renal impairment is recommended in the elderly (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nFampyra is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance <50 ml/min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Fampyra in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFampyra is for oral use. \n \nThe tablet must be swallowed whole. It must not be divided, crushed, dissolved, sucked or chewed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to fampridine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine). \n \nPatients with prior history or current presentation of seizure. \n \nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). \n \nConcomitant use of Fampyra with medicinal products that are inhibitors of Organic Cation \nTransporter 2 (OCT2) for example, cimetidine. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSeizure risk \n \nTreatment with fampridine increases seizure risk (see section 4.8). \n \nFampyra should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may lower seizure \nthreshold. \n \nFampyra should be discontinued in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nFampyra is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment have higher \nplasma concentrations which are associated with increased adverse reactions, in particular \nneurological effects. Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring during \ntreatment is recommended in all patients (particularly in the elderly  in whom renal function might be \nreduced). Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCaution is required when Fampyra is prescribed in patients with mild renal impairment or in patients \nusing medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol and \nmetformin. \n \nHypersensitivity Reactions \n \nIn post-marketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) have \nbeen reported, the majority of these cases occurred within the first week of treatment. Particular \nattention should be given to patients with a previous history of allergic reactions. If an anaphylactic or \nother serious allergic reaction occurs, Fampyra should be discontinued and not restarted. \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \nFampyra should be administered with caution to patients with cardiovascular symptoms of rhythm and \nsinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction cardiac disorders (these effects are seen in overdose). There is \nlimited safety information in these patients. \n \nThe increased incidence of dizziness and balance disorder seen with Fampyra may result in an \nincreased risk of falls. Therefore, patients should use walking aids as needed. \n \nIn clinical studies low white blood cell counts were seen in 2.1% of Fampyra patients versus 1.9% of \npatients on placebo. Infections were seen in the clinical studies (see section 4.8) and increased \ninfection rate and impairment of the immune response cannot be excluded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% \n(see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the \nconcomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, \ncimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol and metformin is cautioned \n(see section 4.4.) \n \nInterferon: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with interferon-beta and no \npharmacokinetic medicinal product interactions were observed. \n \nBaclofen: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with baclofen and no pharmacokinetic \nmedicinal product interactions were observed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is \npreferable to avoid the use of Fampyra in pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fampridine is excreted in human or animal milk. Fampyra is not recommended \nduring breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nFertility \n \nIn animal studies no effects on fertility were seen. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFampyra has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because Fampyra can \ncause dizziness. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of Fampyra has been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open label long \nterm studies and in the post marketing setting. \n \nAdverse reactions identified are mostly neurological and include seizure, insomnia, anxiety, balance \ndisorder, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremor, headache and asthenia. This is consistent with fampridine’s \npharmacological activity. The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo-\ncontrolled trials in multiple sclerosis patients with Fampyra given at the recommended dose, are \nreported as urinary tract infection (in approximately 12% of patients). \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMedDRA SOC Adverse Reaction Frequency category \nInfections and infestations Urinary tract infection1 \n\nInfluenza1 \nNasopharyngitis1 \nViral infection1 \n\nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis \nAngioedema \nHypersensitivity \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia \nAnxiety \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness \nHeadache \nBalance disorder \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nSeizure 3 \nExacerbation of trigeminal \nneuralgia \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n \n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations Common \n Tachycardia Uncommon \nVascular disorders Hypotension2 Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea  \nPharyngolaryngeal pain \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nDyspepsia  \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash \nUrticaria \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nBack pain Common  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nAsthenia \nChest discomfort2 \n\nCommon \nUncommon \n\n1 See section 4.4 \n2 These symptoms were observed in the context of hypersensitivity \n3 See sections 4.3 and 4.4 \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIn post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions (including \nanaphylaxis) which have occurred with one or more of the following: dyspnoea, chest discomfort, \nhypotension, angioedema, rash and urticaria. For further information on hypersensitivity reactions, \nplease refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nAcute symptoms of overdose with Fampyra were consistent with central nervous system excitation \nand included confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, and amnesia. \n \nCentral nervous system side effects at high doses of 4-aminopyridine include dizziness, confusion, \nseizures, status epilepticus, involuntary and choreoathetoid movements. Other side effects at high \ndoses include cases of cardiac arrhythmias (for example, supraventricular tachycardia and \nbradycardia) and ventricular tachycardia as a consequence of potential QT prolongation. Reports of \nhypertension have also been received. \n \nManagement \n \nPatients who overdose should be provided supportive care. Repeated seizure activity should be treated \nwith benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or other appropriate acute anti-seizure therapy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX07. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFampyra is a potassium channel blocker. By blocking potassium channels, Fampyra reduces the \nleakage of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing \naction potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by \nenhancing action potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous \nsystem. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThree phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled confirmatory studies, (MS-F203 and \nMS-F204 and 218MS305) have been performed. The proportion of responders was independent of \nconcomitant immunomodulatory therapy (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod and \nnatalizumab). The Fampyra dose was 10 mg BID. \n \nStudies MS-F203 and MS-F204 \n \nThe primary endpoint in studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 was the responder rate in walking speed as \nmeasured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW). A responder was defined as a patient who \nconsistently had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double \nblind period as compared to the maximum value among five off-treatment visits. \n \nA significantly greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients were responders as compared to placebo \n(MS-F203: 34.8% vs. 8.3%, p<0.001; MS-F204: 42.9% vs. 9.3%, p<0.001). \n \nPatients who responded to Fampyra increased their walking speed on average by 26.3% vs 5.3% on \nplacebo (p<0.001) (MS-F203) and 25.3% vs 7.8% (p< 0.001) (MS-F204). The improvement appeared \nrapidly (within weeks) after starting Fampyra. \n \nStatistically and clinically meaningful improvements in walking were seen, as measured by the 12- \nitem Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1: Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 \n \nSTUDY * MS-F203 MS-F204 \n     \n Placebo Fampyra \n\n10 mg BID \nPlacebo Fampyra \n\n10 mg BID \nn of subjects  72 224 118 119 \n\n     \nConsistent \nimprovement \n\n8.3% 34.8% 9.3% 42.9% \n\nDifference   26.5%  33.5% \nCI95% \n\nP-value \n 17.6%, 35.4% \n\n< 0.001 \n 23.2%, 43.9% \n\n< 0.001 \n \n\n≥20% improvement 11.1% 31.7% 15.3% 34.5% \nDifference   20.6%  19.2% \n\nCI95% \nP-value \n\n 11.1%,30.1% \n<0.001 \n\n 8.5%,29.9% \n<0.001 \n\nWalking speed \nFeet/sec  \n\nFt per sec  Ft per sec Ft per sec  Ft per sec \n\nBaseline  2.04 2.02 2.21 2.12 \nEndpoint 2.15 2.32 2.39 2.43 \n\nChange  0.11 0.30 0.18  0.31 \nDifference 0.19 0.12 \n\np-value 0.010 0.038 \nAverage % Change 5.24 13.88 7.74 14.36 \n\nDifference 8.65 6.62 \np-value < 0.001 0.007 \n\nMSWS-12-score \n(mean, sem)  \n\n    \n\nBaseline 69.27 (2.22) 71.06 (1.34) 67.03 (1.90) 73.81 (1.87) \nAverage change -0.01 (1.46) -2.84 (0.878) 0.87 (1.22) -2.77 (1.20) \n\nDifference 2.83 3.65 \np-value 0.084 0.021 \n\nLEMMT (mean, sem) \n(Lower Extremity \nManual Muscle Test) \n\n    \n\nBaseline 3.92 (0.070) 4.01 (0.042) 4.01 (0.054) 3.95 (0.053) \nAverage change 0.05 (0.024) 0.13 (0.014) 0.05 (0.024) 0.10 (0.024) \n\nDifference 0.08 0.05 \np-value 0.003 0.106 \n\nAshworth Score \n(A test for muscle \nspasticity) \n\n    \n\nBaseline 0.98 (0.078) 0.95 (0.047) 0.79 (0.058) 0.87 (0.057) \nAverage change -0.09 (0.037) -0.18 (0.022) -0.07 (0.033) -0.17 (0.032) \n\nDifference 0.10 0.10 \np-value 0.021 0.015 \n\n \n \nStudy 218MS305 \n \nStudy 218MS305 was conducted in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. \nDuration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post–treatment follow-up. The \nprimary endpoint was improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients \nachieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks. In this \n\n\n\n9 \n\nstudy there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra \ntreated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled \npatients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]). Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 \nweeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. \n \nFampyra treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up \nand Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility.

Absolute bioavailability of Fampyra prolonged-release \ntablets has not been assessed, but relative bioavailability (as compared to an aqueous oral solution) is \n95%. The Fampyra prolonged-release tablet has a delay in the absorption of fampridine manifested by \nslower rise to a lower peak concentration, without any effect on the extent of absorption. \n \nWhen Fampyra tablets are taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-\ntime curve (AUC0-∞) of fampridine is approximately 2-7% (10 mg dose). The small reduction in AUC \nis not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. However, Cmax increases by 15-23%. \nSince there is a clear relationship between Cmax and dose related adverse reactions, it is recommended \nto take Fampyra without food (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution: \n \nFampridine is a lipid-soluble medicinal product which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. \nFampridine is largely unbound to plasma proteins (bound fraction varied between 3-7% in human \nplasma). Fampridine has a volume of distribution of approximately 2.6 l/kg. \nFampridine is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation: \n \nFampridine is metabolised in humans by oxidation to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and further \nconjugated to the 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate. No pharmacological activity was found for the \nfampridine metabolites against selected potassium channels in vitro. \n \nThe 3-hydroxylation of fampridine to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine by human liver microsomes \nappeared to be catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). \n \nThere was evidence of direct inhibition of CYP2E1 by fampridine at 30 μM (approximately 12% \ninhibition) which is approximately 100 times the average plasma fampridine concentration measured \nfor the 10 mg tablet. \n \nTreatment of cultured human hepatocytes with fampridine had little or no effect on induction of \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5 enzyme activities. \n \nElimination: \n \nThe major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with approximately 90% of the dose \nrecovered in urine as parent medicinal product within 24 hours. Renal clearance (CLR 370 ml/min) is \nsubstantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined glomerular filtration and active \nexcretion by the renal OCT2 transporter. Faecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the \nadministered dose. \n \nFampyra is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of fampridine taken at the recommended dose in patients \nwith full renal function. In patients with renal impairment, accumulation occurs relative to the degree \nof impairment. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nElderly: \n \nFampyra is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, and with creatinine clearance known to \ndecrease with age, monitoring of renal function in elderly patients is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nPaediatric Population: \n \nNo data are available. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: \n \nFampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged medicinal product and therefore renal \nfunction should be checked in patients where renal function might be compromised. Patients with mild \nrenal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times the fampridine \nconcentrations achieved by patients with normal renal function. Fampyra must not be administered to \npatients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFampridine was studied in oral repeat dose toxicity studies in several animal species. \n \nAdverse responses to orally administered fampridine were rapid in onset, most often occurring within \nthe first 2 hours post-dose. Clinical signs evident after large single doses or repeated lower doses were \nsimilar in all species studied and included tremors, convulsions, ataxia, dyspnoea, dilated pupils, \nprostration, abnormal vocalization, increased respiration, and excess salivation. Gait abnormalities and \nhyper-excitability were also observed. These clinical signs were not unexpected and represent \nexaggerated pharmacology of fampridine. In addition, single cases of fatal urinary tract obstructions \nwere observed in rats. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated, but a causal \nrelationship with fampridine treatment cannot be excluded. \n \nIn reproduction toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, decreased weight and viability of foetuses and \noffspring were observed at maternally toxic doses. However, no increased risk for malformations or \nadverse effects on fertility was noted. \n \nIn a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies fampridine did not show any potential to be mutagenic, \nclastogenic or carcinogenic. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Fampyra is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Fampyra \n3. How to take Fampyra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fampyra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fampyra is and what it is used for \n \nFampyra is a medicine used to improve walking in adults (18 years and over) with Multiple Sclerosis \n(MS) related walking disability. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath \naround the nerves leading to muscle weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty walking. \n  \nFampyra contains the active substance fampridine which belongs to a group of medicines called \npotassium channel blockers. They work by stopping potassium leaving the nerve cells which have \nbeen damaged by MS. This medicine is thought to work by letting signals pass down the nerve more \nnormally, which allows you to walk better. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Fampyra \n \nDo not take Fampyra \n \n− if you are allergic to fampridine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n− if you have a seizure or have ever had a seizure (also referred to as a fit or convulsion) \n− if your doctor or nurse has told you that you have moderate or severe kidney problems \n− if you are taking a medicine called cimetidine \n− if you are taking any other medicine containing fampridine. This may increase your risk of \n\nserious side effects \n \n\nTell your doctor and do not take Fampyra if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fampyra: \n− if you feel aware of your heartbeat (palpitations) \n− if you are prone to infections \n\n\n\n26 \n\n− you should use a walking aid, such as a cane, as needed because this medicine may make you \nfeel dizzy or unsteady this may result in an increased risk of falls \n\n− if you have any factors or are taking any medicine which affects your risk of fits (seizure). \n− If you have been told by a doctor that you have mild problems with your kidneys \n \nTell your doctor before you take Fampyra if any of these apply to you. \n \nChildren and in adolescents \n \nDo not give Fampyra to children or adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n \nElderly \n \nBefore starting treatment and during treatment your doctor may check that your kidneys are working \nproperly. \n \nOther medicines and Fampyra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDo not take Fampyra if you are taking any other medicine containing fampridine. \n \nOther medicines that affect the kidneys \n \nYour doctor will be especially careful if fampridine is given at the same time as any medicine which \nmay affect how your kidneys eliminate medicines for example carvedilol, propranolol and metformin. \n \nFampyra with food and drink \n \nFampyra should be taken without food, on an empty stomach. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, tell your doctor before you take Fampyra \n \nFampyra is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nYour doctor will consider the benefit of you being treated with Fampyra against the risk to your baby. \n \nYou should not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nFampyra may have an effect on people’s ability to drive or use machines, it can cause dizziness. Make \nsure you’re not affected before you start driving or use machinery. \n \n \n3. How to take Fampyra \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. Fampyra is only available by prescription and under the supervision of doctors \nexperienced in MS. \n \nYour doctor will give you an initial prescription for 2 to 4 weeks. After 2 to 4 weeks the treatment will \nbe reassessed. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nThe recommended dose is \n \nOne tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening (12 hours apart).
