NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMyocet liposomal 50 mg powder, dispersion and solvent for concentrate for dispersion for infusion.  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nLiposome–encapsulated doxorubicin–citrate complex corresponding to 50 mg doxorubicin \nhydrochloride (HCl). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: The reconstituted medicinal product contains approximately 108 mg \nsodium for a 50 mg doxorubicin HCl dose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder, dispersion and solvent for concentrate for dispersion for infusion \n \nMyocet liposomal is supplied as a three-vial system as follows: \nVial 1 - doxorubicin HCl is a red lyophilised powder. \nVial 2 - liposomes is a white to off-white, opaque and homogeneous dispersion. \nVial 3 - buffer is a clear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMyocet liposomal, in combination with cyclophosphamide, is indicated for the first line treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer in adult women. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of Myocet liposomal should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nuse of chemotherapy. \n \nPosology \nWhen Myocet liposomal is administered in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) the \ninitial recommended dose of Myocet liposomal is 60-75 mg/m2 every three weeks. \n \nOlder people \nSafety and efficacy of Myocet liposomal have been assessed in 61 patients with metastatic breast \ncancer, age 65 and over. Data from randomised controlled clinical trials show that the efficacy and \ncardiac safety of Myocet liposomal in this population was comparable to that observed in patients less \nthan 65 years old. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nAs metabolism and excretion of doxorubicin occurs primarily by the hepatobiliary route, evaluation of \nhepatobiliary function should be performed before and during therapy with Myocet liposomal.  \nBased on limited data in patients with liver metastases, it is recommended that the initial dose of \nMyocet liposomal is reduced in accordance with the following table \n \n\nLiver function tests Dose \nBilirubin < ULN and normal AST Standard dose of 60 - 75mg/m2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\nLiver function tests Dose \nBilirubin < ULN and raised AST Consider a 25% dose reduction \nBilirubin > ULN but < 50 μmol/l 50% dose reduction \n\nBilirubin > 50 μmol/l 75% dose reduction \n \nIf possible, Myocet liposomal should be avoided in patients with bilirubin > 50 μmol/l as the \nrecommendation is based mainly on extrapolations. \n \nFor dose reductions due to other toxicity, see section 4.4. \n \nPatients with  renal impairment \nDoxorubicin is metabolised largely by the liver and excreted in the bile. Therefore dose modification \nis not required for patients with renal function impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Myocet liposomal in children aged up to 17 years has not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nMyocet liposomal must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to administration. A final \nconcentration of between 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml doxorubicin HCl, is required. Myocet liposomal is \nadministered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour.  \n \nMyocet liposomal must not be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or as a bolus \ninjection. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMyelosuppression \nTherapy with Myocet liposomal causes myelosuppression. Myocet liposomal  should not be \nadministered to individuals with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) lower than 1,500 cells/µl or \nplatelets less than 100,000/µl prior to the next cycle. Careful haematological monitoring (including \nwhite blood cell and platelet count, and haemoglobin) should be performed during therapy with \nMyocet liposomal. \nA meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of grade 4 neutropenia (RR = 0.82, \np=0.005) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus conventional doxorubicin. However, no \nsignificant differences were identified in the occurrence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and episodes \nof neutropenic fever. \n \nHaematological as well as other toxicity may require dose reductions or delays. The following dosage \nmodifications are recommended during therapy and should be performed in parallel for both Myocet \nliposomal and cyclophosphamide. Dosing subsequent to a dose reduction is left to the discretion of the \nphysician in charge of the patient. \n \n\nHaematological Toxicity \nGrade Nadir ANC \n\n(cells/µl) \nNadir Platelet Count \n\n(cells/µl) \nModification \n\n1 1500 – 1900 75,000 – 150,000 None \n2 1000 – Less than 1500 50,000 – Less than 75,000 None \n3 500 – 999 25,000 – Less than 50,000 Wait until ANC 1500 or \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHaematological Toxicity \nGrade Nadir ANC \n\n(cells/µl) \nNadir Platelet Count \n\n(cells/µl) \nModification \n\nmore and/or platelets \n100,000 or more then redose \nat 25% dose reduction \n\n4 Less than 500 Less than 25,000 Wait until ANC 1500 and/or \nplatelets 100,000 or more \nthen redose at 50% dose \nreduction \n\n \nIf myelotoxicity delays treatment to greater than 35 days after the first dose of the previous cycle, then \nconsideration should be given to stopping treatment. \n \n\nMucositis \nGrade Symptoms Modification \n\n1 Painless ulcers, erythema, or mild \nsoreness. \n\nNone \n\n2 Painful erythema, oedema or ulcers but \ncan eat. \n\nWait one week and if the symptoms \nimprove redose at 100% dose \n\n3 Painful erythema, oedema or ulcers and \ncannot eat \n\nWait one week and if symptoms improve \nredose at 25% dose reduction \n\n4 Requires parenteral or enteral support Wait one week and if symptoms improve \nredose at 50% dose reduction \n\n \nFor dose reduction of Myocet liposomal due to liver function impairment, see section 4.2. \n \nCardiac toxicity \nDoxorubicin and other anthracyclines can cause cardiotoxicity. The risk of toxicity rises with \nincreasing cumulative doses of those medicinal products and is higher in individuals with a history of \ncardiomyopathy, or mediastinal irradiation or pre-existing cardiac disease. \n \nAnalyses of cardiotoxicity in clinical trials have shown a statistically significant reduction in cardiac \nevents in patients treated with Myocet liposomal compared to patients treated with conventional \ndoxorubicin at the same dose in mg. A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of \nboth clinical heart failure (RR = 0.20, p=0.02) and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined (RR \n= 0.38, p<0.0001) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus conventional doxorubicin. The \nreduced risk of cardiotoxicity has also been shown in a retrospective analysis in patients who had \nreceived prior adjuvant doxorubicin (log-rank P=0.001, Hazard Ratio=5.42). \n \nIn a phase III study in combination with cyclophosphamide (CPA) comparing Myocet liposomal \n(60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2), 6% versus 21% \nof patients, respectively, developed a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). \nIn a phase III study comparing single-agent Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) versus single-agent \ndoxorubicin (75 mg/m2), 12% versus 27% of patients, respectively developed a significant decrease in \nLVEF. The corresponding figures for congestive heart failure, which was less accurately assessed, \nwere 0% for Myocet liposomal + CPA versus 3% for doxorubicin + CPA, and 2% for Myocet \nliposomal versus 8% for doxorubicin. The median lifetime cumulative dose of Myocet liposomal in \ncombination with CPA to a cardiac event was > 1260 mg/m2, compared to 480 mg/m2 for doxorubicin \ncombination with CPA. \n \nThere is no experience with Myocet liposomal in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, e.g. \nmyocardial infarction within 6 months prior to treatment. Thus, caution should be exercised in patients \nwith impaired cardiac function. The cardiac function of the patients treated concomitantly with \nMyocet liposomal and trastuzumab must be appropriately monitored as described below. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe total dose of Myocet liposomal should also take into account any previous, or concomitant, \ntherapy with other cardiotoxic compounds, including anthracyclines and anthraquinones. \n \nBefore initiation of Myocet liposomal therapy a measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction \n(LVEF) is routinely recommended, either by Multiple Gated Arteriography (MUGA) or by \nechocardiography. These methods should also be applied routinely during Myocet liposomal \ntreatment. The evaluation of left ventricular function is considered mandatory before each additional \nadministration of Myocet liposomal once a patient exceeds a lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose of \n550 mg/m2 or whenever cardiomyopathy is suspected. If LVEF has decreased substantially from \nbaseline e.g. by > 20 points to a final value > 50% or by > 10 points to a final value of < 50%, the \nbenefit of continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of producing irreversible \ncardiac damage. However, the most definitive test for anthracycline myocardial injury, i.e., \nendomyocardial biopsy, should be considered. \n \nAll patients receiving Myocet liposomal should also routinely undergo ECG monitoring. Transient \nECG changes such as T-wave flattening, S-T segment depression and benign arrhythmias are not \nconsidered mandatory indications for the cessation of Myocet liposomal therapy. However, reduction \nof the QRS complex is considered more indicative of cardiac toxicity. \n \nCongestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, and may also be encountered \nafter discontinuation of therapy. \n \nGastroinstestinal disorders \nA meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of nausea/vomiting grade ≥ 3 (RR = 0.65, \np=0.04) and diarrhoea grade ≥ 3(RR = 0.33, p=0.03) in patients treated with Myocet liposomal versus \nconventional doxorubicin. \n \nInjection site reactions \nMyocet liposomal should be considered an irritant and precautions should be taken to avoid \nextravasation. If extravasation occurs, the infusion should be immediately terminated. Ice may be \napplied to the affected area for approximately 30 minutes. Subsequently, the Myocet liposomal \ninfusion should be restarted in a different vein than that in which the extravasation has occurred. Note \nthat Myocet liposomal may be administered through a central or peripheral vein. In the clinical \nprogram, there were nine cases of accidental extravasation of Myocet liposomal, none of which were \nassociated with severe skin damage, ulceration or necrosis. \n \nInfusion associated reactions \nWhen infused rapidly acute reactions associated with liposomal infusions have been reported. \nReported symptoms have included flushing, dyspnoea, fever, facial swelling, headache, back pain, \nchills, tightness in the chest and throat, and/or hypotension. These acute phenomena may be avoided \nby using a 1-hour infusion time. \n \nOther \nFor precautions regarding the use of Myocet liposomal with other medicinal products, see section 4.5. \nAs for other anthracyclines and doxorubicin products, radiation recall may occur in previously \nirradiated fields. \nEfficacy and safety of Myocet liposomal in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer have not been \ndetermined. The importance of apparent differences in tissue distribution between Myocet liposomal \nand conventional doxorubicin has not been elucidated with respect to long-term antitumour efficacy. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions \n \nSpecific medicinal product compatibility studies have not been performed with Myocet liposomal. \nMyocet liposomal is likely to interact with substances that are known to interact with conventional \ndoxorubicin. Plasma levels of doxorubicin and its metabolite, doxorubicinol, may be increased when \ndoxorubicin is administered with cyclosporin, verapamil, paclitaxel or other agents that inhibit P-\nglycoprotein (P-Gp). Interactions with doxorubicin have also been reported for streptozocin, \n\n\n\n6 \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin and warfarin. Studies of the effect of Myocet liposomal on other substances \nare also lacking. However, doxorubicin may potentiate the toxicity of other antineoplastic agents. \nConcomitant treatment with other substances reported to be cardiotoxic or with cardiologically active \nsubstances (e.g. calcium antagonists) may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity. Concomitant therapy \nwith other liposomal or lipid-complexed substances or intravenous fat emulsions could change the \npharmacokinetic profile of Myocet liposomal. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective contraceptive during treatment with Myocet \nliposomal and up to 6 months following discontinuation of therapy.  \n \nPregnancy \nDue to the known cytotoxic, mutagenic and embryotoxic properties of doxorubicin, Myocet liposomal \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen receiving Myocet liposomal should not breastfeed.  \n \n4.7 Effect on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMyocet liposomal has been reported to cause dizziness. Patients who suffer from this should avoid \ndriving and operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nDuring clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea/vomiting (73%), \nleucopoenia (70%), alopecia (66%), neutropenia (46%), asthenia/fatigue (46%), stomatitis/mucositis \n(42%), thrombocytopenia (31%) and anaemia (30%). \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with Myocet liposomal during clinical studies and \npost marketing experience.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose with Myocet liposomal will worsen toxic side effects. Treatment of acute overdose \nshould focus on supportive care for expected toxicity and may include hospitalisation, antibiotics, \nplatelet and granulocyte transfusions and symptomatic treatment of mucositis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, anthracyclines and related substances, ATC code: \nL01DB01 \n \nThe active substance in Myocet liposomal is doxorubicin HCl. Doxorubicin may exert its antitumour \nand toxic effects by a number of mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II, intercalation \nwith DNA and RNA polymerases, free radical formation and membrane binding. Liposomal-\nencapsulated doxorubicin compared with conventional doxorubicin was not found more active in \ndoxorubicin resistant cell lines in vitro. In animals, liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin reduced the \ndistribution to heart and gastrointestinal mucosa compared with conventional doxorubicin, while \nantitumoural efficacy in experimental tumours was maintained.  \n \nMyocet liposomal (60 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) was compared with conventional doxorubicin + \nCPA (at the same doses) and Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) + CPA (600 mg/m2) was compared to \n\n\n\n9 \n\nepirubicin + CPA (at the same doses). In a third trial, Myocet liposomal (75 mg/m2) monotherapy was \ncompared with conventional doxorubicin monotherapy (at the same dose). Findings regarding \nresponse rate and progression-free survival are provided in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3 \nAntitumour efficacy summary for combination and single-agent studies \n\n \n Myocet \n\nliposomal/CP\nA  \n\n(60/600 \nmg/m2) \n(n=142) \n\nDox 60/CPA \n(60/600 \nmg/m2) \n(n=155) \n\nMyocet \nliposomal/CP\n\nA  \n(75/600 \nmg/m2) \n(n=80) \n\nEpi/CPA  \n(75/600 \nmg/m2) \n(n=80) \n\nMyocet \nliposomal \n\n(75 mg/m2) \n(n=108) \n\nDox  \n(75 mg/m2) \n\n(n=116) \n\n Tumour response rate 43% 43% 46% 39% 26% 26% \n Relative Risk \n (95% C.I.) \n\n1.01 \n(0.78-1.31) \n\n1.19 \n(0.83-1.72) \n\n1.00 \n(0.64-1.56) \n\n Median PFS (months)a 5.1 5.5 7.7 5.6 2.9 3.2 \n Risk Ratio \n (95% C.I.) \n\n1.03 \n(0.80-1.34) \n\n1.52 \n(1.06-2.20) \n\n0.87 \n(0.66-1.16) \n\nAbbreviations: PFS, progression-free survival; Dox, doxorubicin; Epi, epirubicin; Relative Risk, \ncomparator taken as reference; Risk Ratio, Myocet liposomal taken as reference \na Secondary endpoint \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe plasma pharmacokinetics for total doxorubicin in patients receiving Myocet liposomal shows a \nhigh degree of inter-patient variability. In general however, the plasma levels of total doxorubicin are \nsubstantially higher with Myocet liposomal than with conventional doxorubicin, while the data \nindicate that peak plasma levels of free (not liposome-encapsulated) doxorubicin are lower with \nMyocet liposomal than with conventional doxorubicin. Available pharmacokinetic data preclude \nconclusions regarding the relationship between plasma levels of total/free doxorubicin and its \ninfluence on the efficacy/safety of Myocet liposomal. The clearance of total doxorubicin was \n5.1 ± 4.8 l/h and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vd) was 56.6 ± 61.5 l whereas after \nconventional doxorubicin, clearance and Vd were 46.7 ± 9.6 l/h and 1,451 ± 258 l, respectively. The \nmajor circulating metabolite of doxorubicin, doxorubicinol, is formed via aldo-keto-reductase. The \npeak levels of doxorubicinol occur in the plasma later with Myocet liposomal than with conventional \ndoxorubicin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Myocet liposomal have not been specifically studied in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. Doxorubicin is known to be eliminated in large part by the liver. A dose reduction of \nMyocet liposomal has been shown to be appropriate in patients with impaired hepatic function (see \nsection 4.2 for dosage recommendations). \n \nSubstances that inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-Gp) have been shown to alter the disposition of doxorubicin \nand doxorubicinol (see also section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nStudies of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity of Myocet liposomal have not been \nperformed but doxorubicin is known to be both mutagenic and carcinogenic and may cause toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \nVial 1 - doxorubicin HCl \n• lactose \n \nVial 2 - liposomes \n• phosphatidylcholine \n• cholesterol \n• citric acid \n• sodium hydroxide \n• water for injections \n \nVial 3 - buffer \n• sodium carbonate \n• water for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n18 months \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution has been demonstrated for up to 8 hours at \n25°C, and for up to 5 days at 2°C – 8οC. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2οC – 8οC, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken \nplace in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2ºC – 8ºC). \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nMyocet liposomal is available in cartons containing 1 set or 2 sets of the three constituent vials. Not all \npack-sizes may be marketed. \n \nVial 1 - doxorubicin HCl \nType I glass vials sealed with grey butyl rubber stoppers and orange flip-off aluminium seals, \ncontaining 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl lyophilised powder. \n \nVial 2 - liposomes \nType I flint glass tubing vials sealed with siliconised grey stopper and green flip-off aluminium seals, \ncontaining not less than 1.9 ml of liposomes. \n \nVial 3 - buffer \nGlass vials sealed with siliconised grey stopper and blue aluminium flip-off seals, containing not less \nthan 3 ml of buffer. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPreparation of Myocet liposomal \nAseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout handling of Myocet liposomal, since no \npreservative is present. \n \nCaution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of Myocet liposomal. The use of gloves is \nrequired \n \nStep 1.  Set up \nTwo alternative heating methods can be used : a Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater or a water bath: \n• Turn on the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater and set the controller to 75°C-76°C.  Verify the \n\ntemperature set point by checking the thermometer(s) on each heat block insert.   \n• If using a water bath, turn on the water bath and allow it to equilibrate at 58°C (55°C-60°C).  \n\nVerify the temperature set point by checking the thermometer.   \n \n(Please note that whilst the control settings on the water bath and heat block are set to different levels \nthe temperature of the vial contents are in the same range (55°C-60°C)). \n \nRemove the carton of constituents from the refrigerator. \n \nStep 2.  Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl \n• Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride solution for injection (0.9%), (not provided in the package), and \n\ninject into each vial of doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation.  \n• Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved. \n \nStep 3.  Heat in water bath or dry heat block  \n• Heat the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the \n\nthermometer in the block reading (75°C-76°C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes).  If using \na water bath, heat the doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading  55°C-60°C \nfor 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). \n\n• While heating proceed to step 4 \n \nStep 4.  Adjust Ph of liposomes \n• Withdraw 1.9 ml of liposomes. Inject into the buffer vial to adjust the Ph of liposomes.  Pressure \n\nbuild-up may require venting. \n• Shake well. \n \nStep 5.  Add Ph-adjusted liposomes to doxorubicin \n• Using a syringe, withdraw the entire vial contents of Ph-adjusted liposomes from the  buffer vial. \n• Remove the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial from the water bath or dry heat block.  SHAKE \n\nVIGOROUSLY.  Carefully insert a pressure-venting device equipped with a hydrophobic filter.  \nThen IMMEDIATELY (within 2 minutes) inject Ph-adjusted liposomes into vial of heated \nreconstituted doxorubicin HCl.  Remove venting device. \n\n• SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. \n• WAIT for a minimum of 10 MINUTES before using, keeping the medicine at room temperature. \n \n• The Techne DB-3 Dri Block Heater is fully validated for use in the constitution of Myocet \n\nliposomal.  Three inserts, each with two 43.7mm openings per insert must be used.  To ensure \ncorrect temperature control the use of a 35mm immersion thermometer is recommended.  \n\n \nThe resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet liposomal contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml \nof liposomal dispersion (2 mg/ml).  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nAfter reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for \ninjection, or 5% (w/v) glucose solution for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml so that a final \nconcentration of 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml doxorubicin is obtained. \nOnce constituted, the liposomal dispersion for infusion containing liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin \nshould be a red orange opaque homogeneous dispersion. All parenteral solutions should be inspected \nvisually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the preparation if \nforeign particulate matter is present. \n \nProcedure for proper disposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other  information \n \n \n1. What Myocet liposomal is and what is it used for \n \nMyocet liposomal contains a medicine called “doxorubicin”, which damages tumour cells. This type \nof medicine is called “chemotherapy”. The medicine is contained inside very small droplets of fat \ncalled “liposomes”. \n \nMyocet liposomal is used in adult women for the first-line treatment of breast cancer that has spread \n(“metastatic breast cancer”). It is used with another medicine called “cyclophosphamide”. Please also \nread the patient information leaflet carefully that comes with that medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Myocet liposomal  \n \nDo not have Myocet liposomal: \n• if you are allergic to doxorubicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \nDo not have Myocet liposomal if this applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse \nbefore having Myocet liposomal. \n \nWarning and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having Myocet liposomal.  \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before having your medicine if: \n• you have ever had heart problems such as a heart attack, heart failure or you have had high blood \n\npressure for a long time \n• you have liver problems. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nMyocet liposomal. \n \nTests \nYour doctor will do tests during your treatment to check that the medicine is working properly. They \nwill also look out for any side effects such as blood problems or heart problems. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nRadiation therapy \nIf you have already had radiation therapy, this may react with Myocet liposomal. You may get painful, \nred or dry skin. This can happen straight away or later on in your treatment.  \n \nOther medicines and Myocet liposomal \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Myocet liposomal can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines \ncan affect the way Myocet liposomal works. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n• phenobarbital or phenytoin – for epilepsy \n• warfarin – for thinning the blood \n• streptozotocin – for cancer of the pancreas \n• cyclosporine – for changing your immune system. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), please talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nMyocet liposomal. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before having Myocet liposomal.  \n• Myocet liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  \n• Women having Myocet liposomal should not breast-feed.  \n• Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment with Myocet \n\nliposomal and for 6 months after treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy after having Myocet liposomal. If you feel dizzy or are not sure how you feel, do \nnot drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nMyocet liposomal contains sodium  \nMyocet liposomal is available in cartons containing 1 set or 2 sets of 3 vials (not all pack-sizes may be \nmarketed). When the 3 vials have been mixed together, your medicine contains about 108 mg sodium. \nThis should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How Myocet liposomalis given \n \nThis medicine is normally given by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein. \n \nHow much you will be given \nYour doctor will work out exactly how much you need. This is based on the size of your body \n(measured in “square metres” or “m2”). \n \nThe recommended dose is between 60 and 75 mg of the medicine for each square meter of your body: \n• this is given once every 3 weeks \n• the medicine “cyclophosphamide” is given on the same day. \nThe doctor may give you a lower dose if they think you need it. \n \nThe number of times you have the drip depends on: \n• the stage of your breast cancer \n• how well your body responds to the medicine. \nTreatment usually lasts for about 3 to 6 months. \n \nIf you get Myocet liposomal on your skin \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if any medicine leaks from the drip (infusion) onto your skin. \nThis is because Myocet liposomal can damage your skin. The drip will be stopped straight away. Ice \nwill be put on the affected area for 30 minutes. Then the drip will be started in another vein. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following side effects. These are \nsigns of an allergic reaction and your drip (infusion) may have to be stopped: \n• feeling breathless or a tight chest or throat \n• headache or back pain \n• fever or chills \n• swollen or flushed face \n• feeling tired, dizzy or light-headed. \nIf you notice any of the side effects listed above, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.  \n \nOther side effects \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• hair loss  \n• fever, chills, pain \n• loss of appetite, diarrhoea, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting) \n• reduced levels of certain blood cells – your doctor will regularly check your blood for this and \n\ndecide if any treatment is required.

PRESENTATION \n \nMyocet liposomal is supplied as a three-vial system: (1) doxorubicin HCl, (2) liposomes, and \n(3) buffer. In addition to these three components, 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution for injection \nwill also be required for the reconstitution of the doxorubicin HCl. Myocet liposomal must be \nreconstituted prior to administration.  \n \n \n2. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING \n \nThe normal procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-tumour medicinal products should be \nadopted, namely: \n \n\n• Personnel should be trained to reconstitute the medicinal product. \n• Pregnant staff should be excluded from handling the medicinal product. \n• Personnel handling this medicinal product during reconstitution should wear protective \n\nclothing including masks, goggles and gloves. \n• All items for administration or cleaning, including gloves, should be placed in a high-risk, \n\nwaste disposal bag for high-temperature incineration. Liquid waste may be flushed with large \namounts of water. \n\n• Accidental contact with the skin or eyes should be treated immediately with copious amounts \nof water. \n\n \n \n3. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n \nAseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout handling of Myocet liposomal since no \npreservative is present. \n \n3.1 Preparation of Myocet liposomal \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n35 \n\nStep 1.  Set up \nTwo alternative heating methods can be used : a Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater or a water bath: \n\n• Turn on the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater and set the controller to 75°C-76°C.  Verify the \ntemperature set point by checking the thermometer(s) on each heat block insert.   \n\n• If using a water bath, turn on the water bath and allow it to equilibrate at 58°C (55°C-60°C).  \nVerify the temperature set point by checking the thermometer.   \n\n \n(Please note that whilst the control settings on the water bath and heat block are set to different levels \nthe temperature of the vial contents are in the same range (55°C-60°C)). \n \n\n• Remove the carton of constituents from the refrigerator. \n \nStep 2.  Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl \n\n• Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride solution for injection (0.9%), (not provided in the package), \nand inject into each vial of doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation.  \n\n• Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved. \n \nStep 3.  Heat in water bath or dry heat block \n\n• Heat the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the \nthermometer in the block reading (75°C-76°C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes).   \n\n• If using a water bath, heat the doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading \n55°C-60°C for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). \n\n• While heating proceed to step 4. \n \nStep 4.  Adjust pH of liposomes \n\n• Withdraw 1.9 ml of liposomes. Inject into the buffer vial to adjust the pH of liposomes.  \nPressure build-up may require venting. \n\n• Shake well. \n \nStep 5.  Add pH-adjusted liposomes to doxorubicin \n\n• Using a syringe, withdraw the entire vial contents of pH-adjusted liposomes from the buffer \nvial. \n\n• Remove the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial from the water bath or dry heat block.  \nSHAKE VIGOROUSLY. Carefully insert a pressure-venting device equipped with a \nhydrophobic filter. Then IMMEDIATELY (within 2 minutes) inject the pH-adjusted \nliposomes into the vial of heated reconstituted doxorubicin HCl. Remove venting device. \n\n• SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. \n• WAIT FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 MINUTES BEFORE USING, KEEPING THE MEDICINE \n\nAT ROOM TEMPERATURE. \n \nThe Techne DB-3 Dri Block Heater is fully validated for use in the constitution of Myocet liposomal. \nThree inserts, each with two 43.7mm openings per insert must be used. To ensure correct temperature \n\ncontrol the use of a 35mm immersion thermometer is recommended. \n \nThe resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet liposomal  contains 50 mg of doxorubicin \nHCl/25 ml of concentrate for liposomal dispersion for infusion (2 mg/ml).  \n \nAfter reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride \nsolution for injection, or 5% (w/v) glucose solution for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml \nper 50 mg reconstituted Myocet liposomal so that a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml \ndoxorubicin is obtained. \n \nOnce constituted, the liposomal dispersion for infusion containing liposome encapsulated doxorubicin \nshould be a red-orange opaque homogeneous dispersion. All parenteral medicinal products should be \ninspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the \npreparation if foreign particulate matter is present. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nIt has been demonstrated that once reconstituted Myocet liposomal has a chemical and physical in-use \nstability at room temperature for up to 8 hours or in a refrigerator (2οC-8οC) for up to 5 days.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2οC-8οC, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken \nplace in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nMyocet liposomal should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour.  \nWarning: Myocet liposomal must not be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or \nas a bolus injection. \n \n \n4. DISPOSAL \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
