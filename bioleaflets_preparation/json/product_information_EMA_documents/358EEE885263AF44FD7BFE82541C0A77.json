NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLuminity 150 microlitres/ml gas and solvent for dispersion for injection/infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains a maximum of 6.4 x 109 perflutren-containing lipid microspheres, with a mean \ndiameter range of 1.1-2.5 micrometres (μm). The approximate amount of perflutren gas in each ml is \n150 microlitres (μl). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nEach ml contains 2.679 mg sodium \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGas and solvent for dispersion for injection/infusion \n \nColourless, uniformly clear to translucent liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nLuminity is an ultrasound contrast-enhancing agent for use in adult patients in whom non-contrast \nechocardiography was suboptimal (suboptimal is considered to indicate that at least two of six \nsegments in the 4- or 2-chamber view of the ventricular border were not evaluable) and who have \nsuspected or established coronary artery disease, to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and \nimprovement of left ventricular endocardial border delineation at both rest and stress. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLuminity should only be administered by trained physicians with technical expertise in performing \nand interpreting contrast echocardiograms, and appropriate resuscitation equipment should be \navailable in case of cardiopulmonary or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nBolus intravenous injection using non-linear contrast imaging technique at rest and stress: \n \nThe recommended dose is multiple injections of 0.1 to 0.4 ml of dispersion, followed by a 3 to 5 ml \nbolus of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to maintain \noptimal contrast enhancement. The total dose of perflutren should not exceed 1.6 ml. \n \nBolus intravenous injection using fundamental imaging technique at rest: \n \nThe recommended dose is 10 microlitre dispersion/kg by slow bolus intravenous injection, followed \nby a 10 ml bolus of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. \nIf necessary, a second 10 microlitre dispersion/kg dose followed by a second 10 ml bolus of sodium \n\n2 \n\n\n\nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection may be administered \n5 minutes after the first injection to prolong contrast enhancement. \n \nIntravenous infusion using non-linear contrast imaging technique (rest and stress) or fundamental \nimaging technique at rest: \n \nThe recommended dose via an intravenous infusion is 1.3 ml dispersion added to 50 ml of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. The rate of infusion should \nbe initiated at 4 ml/minute, but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement, not to \nexceed 10 ml/minute. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Luminity in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment   \nLuminity has not been specifically studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in this patient \ngroup should be on the basis of a benefit risk assessment by the physician. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLuminity has not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment. Use in this patient group \nshould be on the basis of a benefit risk assessment by the physician. \n \nElderly patients \nLuminity has not been specifically studied in elderly patients. Use in this patient group should be on \nthe basis of a benefit risk assessment by the physician. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nBefore administering Luminity, the medicinal product must be activated by using a mechanical \nshaking device, the Vialmix, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThis product must only be administered intravenously. \n \nLuminity should not be used with fundamental imaging technique for stress echocardiography since \nefficacy and safety have not been established. \n \nPatients with unstable cardiopulmonary status \nDuring contrast-enhanced echocardiography, serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, \nhave occurred during or within 30 minutes of Luminity administration in patients including those with \nsevere cardiac and pulmonary diseases (see section 4.8). Extreme caution should be used when \nconsidering the administration of Luminity to patients with unstable cardiopulmonary status, for \nexample: unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, severe ventricular arrhythmias, severe heart \nfailure (NYHA IV) or respiratory failure. Luminity should only be administered to such patients after \ncareful risk/benefit assessment. \n \nContrast-enhanced echocardiography should only be considered in such patients if the results are \nlikely to produce a change in individual patient management. \n \n\n3 \n\n\n\nPatients with unstable cardiopulmonary status should be monitored during and for at least 30 minutes \nfollowing Luminity administration. For such patients monitoring should include vital sign \nmeasurements, electrocardiography, and, if clinically appropriate, cutaneous oxygen saturation. \nResuscitation equipment and trained personnel must always be readily available. \nPatients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, endocarditis, prosthetic heart valves, systemic \ninflammation, sepsis, hyperactive coagulation and/or recurrent thromboembolism \nLuminity should be used only after careful consideration and such use should be monitored closely \nduring administration in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, endocarditis, a heart with \nprosthetic valves, acute states of systemic inflammation or sepsis, known states of hyperactive \ncoagulation and/or recurrent thromboembolism. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nSerious immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg: anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid \nreactions, hypotension and angioedema) have been reported following the administration of Luminity. \nPatients should be closely monitored and administration should be under the direction of a physician \nexperienced in the management of hypersensitivity reactions including severe allergic reactions, which \nmight require resuscitation. Emergency equipment and personnel trained in its use must be readily \navailable. \n \nPulmonary disease \nCaution should be exercised in patients with clinically significant pulmonary disease, including diffuse \ninterstitial pulmonary fibrosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as no studies have \nbeen performed in these patients. \n \nPatients with Cardiac Shunts \nThe safety of Luminity in patients with right-to-left, bi-directional or transient right-to-left cardiac \nshunts has not been studied. In these patients, phospholipid encapsulated microspheres can bypass the \nlung and directly enter the arterial circulation. Caution must be exercised when considering the \nadministration of Luminity to these patients. \n \nPatients on mechanical ventilation  \nThe safety of microspheres in patients on mechanical ventilation has not been established. Caution \nshould be exercised when considering the administration of Luminity to these patients. \n \nAdministration and mechanical activation procedure \nLuminity should not be administered by methods not specified in section 4.2 (e.g. intra-arterial \ninjection). \n \nIf Luminity is administered directly to the patient without undergoing the mechanical activation \nprocedure using the Vialmix (see section 6.6), the product will not produce its intended effect. \n \nSodium Content \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- \nfree’ . \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed and no other forms of interaction have been identified. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor perflutren, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant \nwomen. \n\n4 \n\n\n\n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Luminity is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, caution should be \nexercised when Luminity is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAs Luminity has no pharmacologic effect, and on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and \npharmacodynamic profiles, no or negligible influence is expected with the use of this product on the \nability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe reported adverse reactions following the use of Luminity in pivotal and supportive trials (total of \n2,526 patients) occur within minutes after administration and usually resolve without therapeutic \nintervention within 15 minutes. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are: headache (2.0%), \nflushing (1.0%) and back pain (0.9%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions were reported with the following frequencies (Very common ≥ 1/10; Common \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; Uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; Rare ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; Very rare \n< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nImmune system disorders Not known: Allergic type reactions, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic \n\nshock and anaphylactoid type reactions, hypotension, angioedema, \nlip swelling, bronchospasm, rhinitis, upper airway swelling, throat \ntightness, facial swelling, eye swelling \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Headache \n \nUncommon: Dizziness, dysgeusia \n \nRare: Paraesthesia  \n \nNot known: seizures, facial hypoaesthesia, loss of consciousness \n\nEye disorders Not known: Abnormal vision \nCardiac disorders Rare: Bradycardia, Tachycardia, Palpitations \n\n \nNot known: Cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular \nfibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular \ncontactions), asystole, atrial fibrillation, cardiac ischaemia, \nsupraventricular tachycardia, supraventricular arrhythmia \n\nVascular disorders  Common: Flushing \n \nUncommon: Hypotension \n \nRare: Syncope, hypertension, peripheral coldness  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon: Dyspnoea, Throat Irritation \n \nRare: Respiratory Distress, Cough, Dry Throat \n \nNot known: Respiratory arrest, decreased oxygenation, hypoxia,  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Uncommon: Abdominal Pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting,  \n\n5 \n\n\n\n \nRare: Dyspepsia \n \nNot known: Tongue disorder  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Pruritus, increased sweating \n \nRare: Rash, urticaria, erythema, erythematous rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Back pain \n \nRare: Arthralgia, flank pain, neck pain, muscle cramp \n \nNot known: Muscle spasm, musculoskeletal pain,  \nmusculoskeletal discomfort, myalgia, hypertonia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nUncommon: Chest Pain, fatigue, feeling hot, injection site pain \n \nRare: Pyrexia, rigors \n \n\nInvestigations Rare: Abnormal electrocardiogram \n \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe clinical consequences of overdose with Luminity are not known. Single doses of up to \n100 microlitres dispersion/kg and multiple doses up to 150 microlitres dispersion/kg were tolerated \nwell in Phase I clinical trials. Treatment of an overdose should be directed towards the support of all \nvital functions and prompt institution of symptomatic therapy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: ultrasound contrast media, microspheres of phospholipids, \nATC Code: V08DA04 \n \nThe product consists of lipid encapsulated perflutren microspheres. Microspheres in the 1 to < 10 µm \ndiameter size range contribute to the contrast effect by generating strongly enhanced echoes. \n \nThe ultrasound echoes from blood and biological soft tissues such as fat and muscles are generated at \ninterfaces due to small differences in the ultrasonic properties of the tissues. The ultrasonic properties \nof the product are very different from those of soft tissue and will generate strong echoes. \n \nAs Luminity consists of microspheres that are stable and small enough for transpulmonary passage, \nenhanced echo signals in the left heart and systemic circulation are obtained. \n \nA strict dose/response relationship cannot be defined, although higher doses have been shown to \nproduce a contrast effect of longer duration. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\n6 \n\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Luminity were evaluated in normal healthy subjects and subjects \nwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following intravenous administration of a \n50 µl/kg dose of the product. \n \nThe perflutren component of Luminity was rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation via the lungs. \nThe percentage of the perflutren dose excreted in expired air was approximately 50% of the \nadministered dose due to the small quantities of perflutren given and the inability to quantify low \nlevels of perflutren by gas chromatography. In most subjects after 4-5 minutes, perflutren was \nundetectable in blood and expired air. Perflutren concentrations in blood were shown to decline in a \nmono-exponential fashion with a mean half-life of 1.3 minutes in healthy subjects and 1.9 minutes in \nCOPD subjects. The systemic clearance of perflutren was similar in healthy and COPD subjects. Total \nlung clearance (CLlung) of perflutren was shown to be no different in healthy subjects compared to \nCOPD subjects. CLlung was found to be significantly reduced (51%) in females compared to males (all \nsubjects). These results suggest that overall perflutren systemic elimination is rapid and is not \nsignificantly reduced in COPD patients compared to healthy subjects. Doppler ultrasound \nmeasurements were performed with Luminity in conjunction with the pharmacokinetic evaluation of \nperflutren. Doppler signal intensity corresponded well with measured and extrapolated perflutren \nconcentrations in blood. The time to maximum Doppler signal intensity tmax was shown to be similar to \nthe perflutren blood tmax (1.13 versus 1.77 minutes). The observed 99% drop in Doppler signal \nintensity within 10 minutes (t1/2 approximately 2 minutes) was in agreement with the decline in \nmeasurable blood levels of perflutren. \n \nFundamental and non-linear imaging techniques (second harmonic, multipulse phase and/or amplitude \nmodulation) using both continuous and triggered acquisition were utilised in clinical studies with \nLuminity. \n \nThe naturally occurring phospholipids in Luminity (see section 6.1) are distributed in the endogenous \nlipid pools in the body (for example, liver) whereas the synthetic component (MPEG5000) has been \nshown to be excreted in the urine in preclinical studies. All lipids are metabolised to free fatty acids. \nThe pharmacokinetics and metabolism of MPEG5000 DPPE have not been evaluated in humans. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special population groups \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics has not been specifically studied in the elderly. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetics has not been specifically studied in the renal disease patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetics has not been specifically studied in the hepatic disease patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity, \nfertility, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development, and local tolerance. \n \nAbnormal respiration, heart rate changes and decreased activity were observed soon after intravenous \ninjection of Luminity at doses ≥ 0.3 ml/kg in single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and \nmonkeys. Higher doses of the product, typically ≥ 1 ml/kg, resulted in more severe signs including \nunresponsiveness and occasionally death. These levels are substantially above the recommended \nmaximal clinical dose. Rats treated with Luminity for 1 month exhibited dose-related, reversible \nperivascular and peribronchiolar eosinophil infiltration, alveolar macrophage accumulation and \nincreased goblet cell size and number in the lungs.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n17 \n\n\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nLuminity 150 microlitres/ml gas and solvent for dispersion for injection/infusion \nperflutren \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Luminity is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Luminity  \n3. How to use Luminity  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Luminity  \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. What Luminity is and what it is used for \n \nLuminity is an ultrasound contrast agent that contains microspheres (tiny bubbles) of perflutren gas as \nthe active substance. \n\nLuminity is for diagnostic use only. It is a contrast agent (a medicine that helps to make internal body \nstructures visible during imaging tests). \n\nLuminity is used in adults to obtain a clearer scan of the chambers of the heart, especially of the left \nventricle, during echocardiography (a diagnostic test where an image of the heart is obtained using \nultrasound). Luminity is used in patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease \n(obstruction of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle), when the image obtained with non-\ncontrast echocardiography is not optimal. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Luminity  \n \nDo not use Luminity \n- if you are allergic to perflutren or any of the other ingredients of Luminity. \n (listed in section 6).  \n \nIf you have had an allergic reaction in the past with Luminity or any other ultrasound contrast agent \ntell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Luminity \n- if you have been told you have a heart shunt \n- if you have severe heart or lung diseases or if you need mechanical help to breathe \n- if you have an artificial valve in your heart \n- if you have an acute severe inflammation/sepsis \n- if you have known hyperactive coagulation system (blood clotting issues) or recurrent \nthromboembolism (blood clots) \n- if you have a liver disease \n- if you have a kidney disease \n\n18 \n\n\n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nLuminity should not be used in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) as it has not been \nstudied in these groups \n \nOther medicines and Luminity \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice \nbefore you are given Luminity.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nLuminity has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nLuminity contains sodium. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \nLuminity contains propylene glycol. \nThis medicine contains 103.5 mg/ml propylene glycol, which is equivalent to 182.2mg in each vial. \n \n3. How to use Luminity \n \nLuminity is given to you before or during your ultrasound examination by healthcare professionals \nsuch as doctors who are experienced in this type of examination. They will calculate the right dose for \nyou. \n \nLuminity is for intravenous use (direct injection into the vein). Before use, this medicine must be \nactivated by shaking it using a mechanical device called Vialmix, which is supplied to doctors who \nneed to prepare the medicine. This ensures that the medicine is shaken in the correct way and for long \nenough to make up a ‘dispersion’ of microspheres of perflutren gas of the right size to get a good \nquality image.  \n \nLuminity is then given into a vein either as a ‘bolus’ injection (given all at once) or as an infusion \n(drip solution) after being diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) \nsolution for injection. In some cases, your doctor may choose to use two injections to complete the \nultrasound examination.  The way Luminity is given and the dose depend on the technique used for the \nechocardiography. \n \nIf you are given more Luminity than you should \nOverdose is not likely to happen since the medicine is administered by a doctor. In the case of \noverdose the doctor will take appropriate action. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSome patients may experience allergic type reactions such as swelling of the face. There is however a \nrisk that these allergic type reactions become severe and may include anaphylactic shock (a serious, \npotentially life-threatening allergic response). In addition, some patients may experience convulsions, \nwhich may be associated with these allergic reactions. \n \nHeart or breathing problems including cardiac arrest have occurred in some patients. In clinical trials \nthese reactions were reported rarely and for post-marketing reports the frequency is not known. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n19 \n\n\n\nHeadache, flushing. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n• Dizziness,  \n• altered taste,  \n• reduced blood pressure,  \n• difficulty in breathing, throat irritation,  \n• abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting,  \n• itching,  \n• increased sweating,  \n• back pain, chest pain,      \n• fatigue,  \n• feeling hot and  \n• pain at the site of injection. \n\n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n\n• Numbness, tingling and or burning sensation,  \n• altered heart rate, palpitations (you feel your heart beats harder or in an irregular way),  \n• feeling faint,  \n• increased blood pressure,  \n• peripheral coldness,  \n• breathing problems, cough, dry throat, difficulty in swallowing,  \n• rash, redness of the skin, \n• joint pain, pain on the side(s), neck pain, muscle cramp, fever, muscle stiffness \n• and abnormal electrocardiogram. \n\n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n• loss of consiousness,  \n• numbness of the face,  \n• eye swelling,  \n• and abnormal vision. \n\n \nThese side effects usually go away quickly without any treatment. \n \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your  doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n5. How to store Luminity \n \nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use Luminity after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. \n \nBefore activation (shaking), store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \nAfter activation (shaking), do not store above 30°C. \n \nThe dispersion should be given to you within 12 hours of activation (shaking). \n \nThe product can be re-activated up to 48 hours after initial activation and used up to 12 hours after the \nsecond activation. \n \n \n\n20 \n\n\n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Luminity contains  \n \n- The active substance is perflutren. Each ml contains a maximum of 6.4 x 109 perflutren-containing \n\nlipid bubbles, with an average diameter range of 1.1-2.5 micrometres.
