NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIXIARO suspension for injection \nJapanese encephalitis vaccine (inactivated, adsorbed) \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) of IXIARO contains: \nJapanese encephalitis virus strain SA14-14-2 (inactivated)1,2 6 AU3 \ncorresponding to a potency of ≤ 460 ng ED50 \n \n1 produced in Vero cells \n2 adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated (approximately 0.25 milligrams Al3+) \n3 Antigen Units \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage i.e. essentially \n‘potassium-free’ and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. This product might contain traces of residual sodium metabisulfite which is below detection \nlimit. \n \nPhosphate Buffered Saline 0.0067 M (in PO4) has the following saline composition: \nNaCl – 9mg/mL \nKH2PO4 – 0.144 mg/mL \nNa2HPO4 – 0.795 mg/mL \n \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nClear liquid with a white precipitate. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIXIARO is indicated for active immunisation against Japanese encephalitis in adults, adolescents, children \nand infants aged 2 months and older. \n \nIXIARO should be considered for use in individuals at risk of exposure through travel or in the course of \ntheir occupation. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (18 to  ≤ 65 years of age) \nThe primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each, according to the following \nconventional schedule: \nFirst dose at Day 0. \nSecond dose: 28 days after first dose. \n \nRapid schedule  \nPersons aged 18 to ≤ 65 years can be vaccinated in a rapid schedule as follows: \n\n\n\n3 \n\nFirst dose at Day 0. \nSecond dose: 7 days after first dose.  \n \nWith both schedules, primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential \nexposure to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (see section 4.4). \nIt is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose \nvaccination course with IXIARO. \nIf the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might not \nbe achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high \nseroconversion rates (see section 5.1). \n \nBooster dose  \nA booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary \nimmunization, prior to potential re-exposure to JEV.  \n \nPersons at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (laboratory personnel or persons residing in \nendemic areas) should receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immunization (see section 5.1).  \nLong-term seroprotection data following a first booster dose administered 12 - 24 months after primary \nimmunization suggest that a second booster should be given 10 years after the first booster dose, prior to \npotential exposure to JEV.  \n \nElderly (>65 years of age) \nThe primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each, according to the following \nconventional schedule: \nFirst dose at Day 0. \nSecond dose: 28 days after first dose. \n \nThe primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese \nencephalitis virus (JEV) (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose \nvaccination course with IXIARO. \n \nIf the primary immunization of two injections is not completed, full protection against the disease might not \nbe achieved. There is data that a second injection given up to 11 months after the first dose results in high \nseroconversion rates (see section 5.1). \n \nBooster dose \nAs with many vaccines, the immune response in elderly persons to IXIARO is lower than in younger adults. \nDuration of protection is uncertain in elderly persons, therefore a booster dose (third dose) should be \nconsidered before any further exposure to JE virus. Long-term seroprotection following a booster-dose is not \nknown. \n \n \nPaediatric Population \nChildren and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age \nThe primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml according to the following schedule: \nFirst dose at Day 0. \nSecond dose: 28 days after first dose. \n \nChildren from 2 months to < 3 years of age \nThe primary vaccination series consists of two separate doses of 0.25 ml according to the following \nschedule: \nFirst dose at Day 0. \nSecond dose: 28 days after first dose. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSee section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. \n \nIt is recommended that vaccinees who received the first dose of IXIARO complete the primary 2-dose \nvaccination course with IXIARO. \n \n\nBooster dose (Children and adolescents) \n\nA booster dose (third dose) should be given within the second year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after primary \nimmunization, prior to potential re-exposure to JEV. \nChildren and adolescents at continuous risk for acquiring Japanese encephalitis (residing in endemic areas) \nshould receive a booster dose at month 12 after primary immunization (see section 5.1). \n \nChildren and adolescents from 3 years to < 18 years of age should receive a single 0.5 ml booster dose. \nChildren from 14 months to < 3 years of age should receive a single 0.25 ml booster dose.  \nSee section 6.6 for instructions on preparing a 0.25 ml dose for children aged 2 months to <3 years. \n \nNo long-term seroprotection data beyond two years after a first booster administered 1 year after primary \nimmunization has been generated in children.  \n \nChildren below 2 months of age \nThe safety and efficacy of IXIARO in children younger than 2 months has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nThe vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. In infants, the \nanterolateral aspect of the thigh may be used as injection site. IXIARO should never be injected \nintravascularly. \nWhen IXIARO is administered concomitantly with injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate \nsyringes at opposite sites. \n \nExceptionally, IXIARO can also be administered subcutaneously to patients with thrombocytopenia or \nbleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration. Subcutaneous \nadministration could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine (see section 4.4). However, it should be \nnoted that there are no clinical efficacy data to support administration by the subcutaneous route. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to the residues \nprotamine sulphate, formaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, host cell DNA, sodium metabisulphite (see \nsection 2.), host cell protein. \nIndividuals who show hypersensitivity reactions after receiving the first dose of the vaccine should not be \ngiven the second dose. \nAdministration must be postponed in persons with acute severe febrile conditions. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be available to \ntreat rare cases of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. \nUnder no circumstances should IXIARO be administered intravascularly. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nAs with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. \nIXIARO will not protect against encephalitis caused by other micro-organisms. \nLike other intramuscular injections, this vaccine should not be administered intramuscularly to persons with \nthrombocytopenia, haemophilia or other bleeding disorders (see section 4.2). \nIn adults a seroconversion rate of 29.4 % has been observed 10 days after the first i.m. vaccination, and 97.3 \n% one week after the second i.m. vaccination in the conventional schedule. After immunisation with the \nrapid schedule a seroconversion rate of 99% has been observed 7 days after the second i.m. vaccination. \nHence, primary immunisation should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to Japanese \nencephalitis virus (JEV). \nProtection against Japanese Encephalitis is not ensured until the second dose has been received. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant administration of IXIARO with other vaccines: \nConcomitant administration of IXIARO with inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and with inactivated rabies \nvaccine in two different schedules has been evaluated in clinical studies. There was no interference with the \nimmune response to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) or to hepatitis A or rabies virus vaccines (see section \n5.1). \nThe safety profiles of IXIARO and the other studied vaccines were not compromised when administered \nconcomitantly. \n \nIn patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency an adequate immune \nresponse may not be obtained. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo interaction studies have been performed in children and adolescents. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant women. \nIn animal studies findings of unclear clinical relevance have been identified (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy should be avoided. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether IXIARO is excreted in human milk. \nNo effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding \nwoman to IXIARO is negligible. However, in the absence of data and as a precautionary measure the use of \nIXIARO during lactation should be avoided. \n \nFertility \nA study in rats did not indicate vaccine-related effects on female reproduction, foetal weight, survival and \ndevelopment of the off-spring. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of Ixiaro was assessed in controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in 5,021 healthy adults (from \nnon-endemic countries) and 1,559 children and adolescents (mostly from endemic countries). \nApproximately 40% of treated subjects experienced systemic adverse reactions and approximately 54% \nexperienced injection site reactions. They usually occur within the first three days after vaccination, are \n\n\n\n6 \n\nusually mild and resolve within a few days. No increase in the number of adverse reactions was noted \nbetween first and second doses or following a booster dose in adults.  \nMost commonly reported adverse reactions in adults included headache (20% of subjects), myalgia (13%), \ninjection site pain (33%), injection site tenderness (33%) and fatigue (12.9%). \n \nMost commonly reported adverse reactions in children and adolescents included pyrexia, diarrhoea,  \ninfluenza like illness, irritability, injection site pain, injection site tenderness, and injection site redness (see \ntable 1). \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequencies: \nVery common: ≥ 1/10 \nCommon: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: ≥1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare: ≥1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \n \nAdult and older adults (>65 years) population  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: lymphadenopathy \nRare: thrombocytopenia  \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nUncommon: migraine, dizziness  \nRare: paraesthesia, neuritis, dysgeusia, syncope*  \n \nEye disorders \nRare: eyelid oedema \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo \n \nCardiac disorders \nRare: palpitations, tachycardia \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nRare: dyspnoea \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \nUncommon: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: rash, pruritus, hyperhidrosis  \nRare: urticaria, erythema \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nUncommon: musculoskeletal stiffness, arthralgia \nRare: pain in extremity  \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site pain, injection site tenderness, fatigue \nCommon: influenza like illness, pyrexia, other injection site reactions e.g. redness, hardening, swelling, \nitching  \nUncommon: chills, malaise, asthenia  \nRare: oedema peripheral \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nInvestigations \nUncommon: hepatic enzymes increased \n \n*reported also from post-marketing experience \n\n \nPaediatric population (2 months to <18 years of age) \n \nTable 1: Frequency of adverse reactions observed in children given the 0.25 ml dose (2 months to <3 \n\nyears of age) and in children and adolescents given the 0.5 ml dose (3 years to <18 years of age) \n \n Frequency of adverse reactions(%) by dose/age  \nSystem Organ Class \n\nPreferred Term \n0.25 ml \nN=783 \n\n2 months to <3 years  \n\n0.5 ml \nN=628 \n\n3 to <18 years \nBlood and Lymphatic System \nDisorders \n\n  \n\nLymphadenopathy 0.1 0.0 \nMetabolism and Nutrition \nDisorders \n\n  \n\nDecreased appetite 8.2 1.9 \nNervous System Disorders   \n\nHeadache 2.9 6.1 \nRespiratory, Thoracic and \nMedistinal Disorders \n\n  \n\nCough 0.5 0.3 \nGastrointestinal Disorders   \n\nDiarrhoea 11.9 1.4 \nVomiting 7.3 1.9 \n\nNausea 3.9 1.9 \nAbdominal pain 0.1 0.0 \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\n  \n\nRash 6.3 1.4 \nMusculoskeletal and Connective \nTissue Disorders \n\n  \n\nMyalgia 3.0 7.1 \nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\n  \n\nPyrexia 28.5 10.4 \nInfluenza like illness 10.9 2.9 \n\nIrritability 10.9 1.9 \nFatigue 3.5 3.5 \n\nInjection site redness 10.0 4.1 \nInjection site pain 6.1 14.1 \n\nInjection site tenderness 4.2 14.7 \nInjection site swelling 3.6 2.2 \n\nInjection site hardening 1.2 1.9 \nInjection site itching 0.6 1.6 \n\nInvestigations   \nHepatic enzymes increased 0.5 0.2 \n\n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms related to overdose were reported. \n \n \nPaediatric population: \nNo case of overdose has been reported in the paediatric population. Inadvertent administration of an 0.5 ml \ndose of IXIARO in children aged 1 to <3 years does not pose any safety concerns (section 5.1.). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, Encephalitis vaccines. ATC code: J07BA02 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines is not well understood. Studies in animals \nhave shown that the vaccine triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against Japanese encephalitis \nvirus that are most often protective. Challenge studies were performed in mice that were treated with human \nIXIARO antisera. These studies showed that almost all mice that had a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test \ntitre of at least 1:10 were protected from a lethal Japanese encephalitis virus challenge. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nNo prospective efficacy trials have been performed. Immunogenicity of IXIARO was studied in \napproximately 3,119 healthy adult subjects included in seven randomized, controlled and five uncontrolled \nPhase 3 trials and in approximately 550 healthy children included in two randomized, controlled and two \nuncontrolled Phase 3 clinical trials. \n \nPivotal immunogenicity trial (adults) \nImmunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, active controlled, observer blinded, \nmulticenter Phase 3 clinical trial including 867 healthy male and female subjects given IXIARO or the US \nlicensed JEV vaccine JE VAX (on a 0, 7 and 28 day schedule by subcutaneous injection). The co-primary \nendpoint was seroconversion rate (anti JEV antibody titer ≥1:10) and geometric mean titers (GMT) at Day 56 \nas assessed by a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) for the entire study population. \nBy Day 56, the proportion of subjects who had seroconverted was similar for both treatment groups (96.4% \nvs. 93.8% for IXIARO and JE VAX, respectively). GMT increased by Day 56 to 243.6 for IXIARO and to \n102.0 for JE VAX, respectively. The immune responses elicited by IXIARO were non inferior to those \ninduced by JE VAX (Table 2). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2: Seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers of IXIARO and JE VAX in the Per Protocol \nPopulation.

Geometric mean \ntiters were significantly higher at Day 28 in subjects aged <50 years than those aged ≥50 years in the JE \nVAX group (80.9 vs. 45.9, p=0.0236) but there was no significant difference at Day 56 for this treatment \ngroup. There were no significant effects of age on geometric mean titer in the group receiving IXIARO. \nThere was no significant difference between seroconversion rates in subjects aged <50 years compared to \nthose aged ≥50 years at Day 28 or Day 56 for either treatment group. \n \nAntibody persistence (adults)  \nAntibody persistence was evaluated in an uncontrolled Phase 3 follow up clinical trial, enrolling subjects \nwho had completed two pivotal studies, and who received at least one dose of IXIARO. Long term \nimmunogenicity of IXIARO was assessed in a subset of 181 subjects up to month 24 (Intent-to-treat (ITT) \npopulation) and in 152 subjects up to month 36 after the first IXIARO vaccination. \nRates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and GMTs at Months 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36 are summarized in Table 3 for \nthe ITT population.  \n \nTable 3: Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and geometric mean titers (GMT) at Month 2, 6, 12, 24 and \n\n36 after vaccination with IXIARO (ITT population) \n \n\n  Rate of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 GMT \nTime point % (n/N) 95% Confidence \n\nInterval \nGMT (N) 95% Confidence \n\nInterval \nMonth 2 98.9 (179/181) [96.1, 99.7] 310.8 (181) [268.8, 359.4] \nMonth 6 95.0 (172/181) [90.8, 97.4] 83.5 (181) [70.9, 98.4] \nMonth 12 83.4 (151/181) [77.3, 88.1] 41.2 (181) [34.4, 49.3] \nMonth 24 81.8 (148/181) [75.5, 86.7] 44.3 (181) [36.7, 53.4] \nMonth 36 84.9 (129/152) [78.3, 89.7] 43.8 (152) [36.5, 52.6] \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe observed decline in GMT is as expected and compares well with data from other inactivated JE \nvaccines. \n \nIn another open-label, follow-up Phase 3 study, the persistence of antibodies up to 24 months after primary \nvaccination was assessed. A total of 116 subjects who had received the recommended primary schedule of \nIXIARO were included in this follow-up study. Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 were 82.8% (95% CI: \n74.9, 88.6, N=116) at Month 6 and 58.3% at Month 12 (95% CI: 49.1, 66.9, N=115). At Month 24, 48.3% \n(95% CI: 39.4, 57.3, N=116) of subjects who completed the recommended primary immunization still had \nPRNT50 titers of ≥1:10. GMT in these subjects was 16.2 (95% CI: 13.8, 19.0) at Month 24.  \n \nBooster immunisation (adults) \nIn an uncontrolled, open-label phase 3 study a single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose of IXIARO was given at \nmonth 15 after primary immunization. All of the 198 subjects treated were included in the ITT and Safety \nPopulations. \nRates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and GMT over time are summarised in table 4: \n\n \nTable 4:  Rates of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10 and GMT before and at months 1, 6 and 12 after a single 6 \n\nmcg (0.5 ml) booster dose administered to subjects at 15 months after recommended primary \nimmunization with IXIARO (ITT population) \n\n \n Rate of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10  GMT  \n  95% CI  95% CI  \n\nPre-booster, Day 0 \n(n=198) \n\n69.2% [62.4%, 75.2%] 22.5 [19.0, 26.7] \n\nDay 28 (n=198) 100.0% [98.1%, 100.0%] 900.1 [742.4, 1091.3] \nMonth 6 (n=197) 98.5% [95.6%, 99.5%] 487.4 [390.7, 608.1] \n\nMonth 12 (n=194) 98.5% [95.6%, 99.5%] 361.4 [294.5, 443.5] \n \nAntibody persistence after booster immunisation (adults) \nIn an uncontrolled, open-label extension to the booster study described above, 67 subjects were followed up \nfor determination of JEV neutralizing antibody titres at approximately 6 years after a booster dose. 96% of \nsubjects (64/67) still had protective antibody levels (PRNT50≥1:10), with a GMT of 148 (95%CI: 107; 207).  \nMathematical modelling was applied to project the average duration of protection. Based on this model, it is \nestimated that average duration of protection will be 14 years and 75% of vaccinees will retain protective \nantibody levels (PRNT50≥1:10) for 10 years. A second booster should therefore be given 10 years after the \nfirst booster dose, administered 1 year after the primary immunization, prior to potential exposure to JEV.  \n \n \nRapid immunisation schedule (adults) \nThe immunogenicity of IXIARO administered in a rapid vaccination schedule was evaluated in a \nrandomized, observer-blind, phase 3 study. A total of 217 subjects aged 18 to  ≤ 65 years received IXIARO \ntogether with inactivated rabies vaccine (Rabipur) in a rapid immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 7 and \n56 subjects received IXIARO alone in the conventional immunisation schedule on Day 0 and Day 28. The \nproportion of subjects that seroconverted by 7 and by 28 days after the last immunisation was similar for \nboth schedules. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers also remained comparably high up to 12 months \nafter the first immunisation in both schedules (Table 5). \nThe rapid schedule was tested for concomitant administration of IXIARO and Rabipur but it can also be used \nfor administration of IXIARO alone, as no immune interference of the two vaccines has been observed (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 5:  Seroconversion rates and GMTs for  anti-JEV neutralizing antibodies on Day 0, 14, 21, 35, \n56 and 365 after immunisation with IXIARO and inactivated rabies vaccine in a rapid \nschedule and IXIARO alone in a conventional schedule (Per Protocol population) \n\n \n Seroconversion Rate \n\n(Rate of subjects with PRNT50≥1:10)  \nGMT  \n\n(plaque reduction neutralization test) \n Rapid Schedule \n\n% (n/N) \nConventional \n\nSchedule \n% (n/N) \n\nRapid Schedule \n (N) \n\nConventional \nSchedule \n\n (N) \nVaccination scheme IXIARO Day 0,7 \n\nRabipur Day 0,3,7 \nIXIARO Day 0,28 \n\n- \nIXIARO Day 0,7 \nRabipur Day 0,3,7 \n\nIXIARO Day 0, 28 \n- \n\nDay 0 6 (13/215) 9 (5/55) 5.63 (215) 5.73 (55) \nDay 14 \n\n \n99 (206/209) NA 715 (209) NA \n\nDay 21 100 (207/208) NA 1255 (208) NA \nDay 35 \n\n \n99 (203/206) 100 (47/47) 690 (206) 376 (47) \n\nDay 56 \n \n\n98 (200/204) 100 (49/49) 372 (204) 337 (49) \n\nDay 365 94 (188/199) 88 (42/48) 117 (199) 39 (48) \nNA= not applicable \n \n \nIncomplete primary immunization (adults) \nThe immunogenicity of booster doses was also assessed in the study investigating persistence of immunity \nfollowing different primary immunization regimens (2x6 mcg: N=116, 1x12mcg: N=116 or 1x6 mcg: \nN=117). A single 6 mcg (0.5 ml) booster dose was administered at 11 or 23 months after the first dose to \nsubjects, which were determined to be seronegative (PRNT50 titers < 1:10) at month 6 and/or month 12 after \nthe primary immunization.

You and your child may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n• This vaccine has been prescribed for you and/or your child only. Do not pass it on to others.   \n• If you and/or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What IXIARO is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you and/or your child receive IXIARO \n3. How IXIARO is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IXIARO \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IXIARO is and what it is used for \n \nIXIARO is a vaccine against the Japanese encephalitis virus. \nThe vaccine causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against this disease. \n \nIXIARO is used to prevent infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This virus is mainly found \nin Asia and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected animal (like pigs). Many \ninfected people develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, JE \nusually starts as a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, tiredness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Confusion \nand agitation also occur in the early stage of disease. \n \nIXIARO should be given only to adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 2 months and older travelling \nto countries, where JE is endemic or who are at risk through work. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you and/or your child receive IXIARO  \n \nDo not use IXIARO: \n• If you and/or your child are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substance or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• If you and/or your child have developed an allergic reaction after receiving a former dose of \n\nIXIARO. Signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of \nthe face and tongue. \n\n• If you and/or your child are ill with a high fever. In this case, your doctor will postpone the \nvaccination. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nIXIARO must not be injected into a blood vessel. \nPrimary immunization should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to JEV. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTell your doctor: \n• If you and/or your child have experienced any health problems after previous administration of any \n\nvaccine. \n• If you and/or your child have any other known allergies. \n• If you and/or your child have a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal) \n\nor a reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia). \n• If your child is younger than 2 months of age, since IXIARO has not been tested in infants younger \n\nthan 2 months of age. \n• If your or your child’s immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you and/or \n\nyour child are taking medicines affecting your immune system (such as a medicine called cortisone \nor cancer medicine). \n\n \nYour doctor will discuss with you the possible risks and benefits of receiving IXIARO. \n \nPlease note that: \n• IXIARO cannot cause the disease it protects against. \n• IXIARO will not prevent infections caused by other viruses than the Japanese encephalitis virus. \n• As with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. \n• You should take appropriate precautions for you and your child to reduce mosquito bites (adequate \n\nclothing, use of repellents, mosquito nets) even after receiving IXIARO. \n \nOther medicines and IXIARO \nStudies in humans to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medicines (clinical trials) have shown that \nIXIARO can be given at the same time with hepatitis A vaccine and rabies vaccine. \nTell your doctor if you and/or your child are taking or have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \nAs a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy or breast-feeding should be avoided. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before receiving this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nIXIARO contains potassium and sodium  \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage i.e. essentially \n‘potassium-free’ and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. This product might contain traces of residual sodium metabisulfite which is below detection \nlimit.  \n \n\n \n3. How to use IXIARO \n \nThe recommended dosage for adults, adolescents and children aged 3 years of age and older is a total of 2 \ninjections of 0.5 ml each: \n \n• The first injection on Day 0 \n• The second injection 28 days after the first injection (Day 28). \n\n \nAdults aged 18 to  ≤ 65 years can also be vaccinated as follows: \n• The first injection on Day 0 \n• The second injection 7 days after the first injection (Day 7). \n \nBabies and children aged 2 months to < 3 years of age  \n\n\n\n30 \n\nThe recommended dosage for babies and children aged 2 months to < 3 years is a total of 2 injections of 0.25 \nml each: \n• The first injection on Day 0 \n• The second injection 28 days after the first injection (Day 28). \n\n \nFor instruction on the preparation of the 0.25 ml dose, please refer to the end of this package leaflet. \n \nMake sure you and/or your child finish the complete vaccination course of 2 injections. The second injection \nshould be given at least 1 week before you and/or your child will be at risk of exposure to JE virus. If not, \nyou and/or your child may not be fully protected against the disease. \n \nFor adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 1 year and older a booster dose can be given within the \nsecond year (i.e. 12 - 24 months) after the first dose of the recommended primary immunization. In adults, a \nsecond booster can be given 10 years after the first booster. For elderly persons (>65 years) the first booster \ndose may be given earlier. Your doctor will decide on the requirement and timing for booster doses. \n \nAdministration \nIXIARO is injected into your or your child's upper arm muscle (deltoid muscle) by your doctor or a nurse. It \nmust not be injected into a blood vessel. In case you and/or your child suffer from a bleeding disorder, your \ndoctor may decide to administer the vaccine under the skin (subcutaneously). \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to get IXIARO \nIf you and/or your child miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit for the \nsecond injection. \nWithout the second injection you and/or your child will not be fully protected against the disease. There is \ndata showing that the second injection can be given up to 11 months after the first one. \n \n \n \n4.
