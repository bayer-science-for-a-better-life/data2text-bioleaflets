NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOdomzo 200 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 200 mg sonidegib (as phosphate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach hard capsule contains 38.6 mg lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nOpaque pink hard capsule containing white to almost white powder with granules, with \u201cNVR\u201d imprinted in \nblack ink on the cap and \u201cSONIDEGIB 200MG\u201d imprinted in black ink on the body. \n \nThe size of the capsule is \u201cSize #00\u201d (dimensions 23.3 x 8.53 mm). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOdomzo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) \nwho are not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nOdomzo should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of a specialist physician experienced in the \nmanagement of the approved indication. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 200 mg sonidegib taken orally. \n \nTreatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity develops. \n \nDose modifications for creatine phosphokinase (CK) elevations and muscle-related adverse reactions \nTemporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of Odomzo therapy may be required for CK elevations \nand muscle-related adverse reactions. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1 summarises recommendations for dose interruption and/or dose reduction of Odomzo therapy in the \nmanagement of symptomatic CK elevations and muscle-related adverse reactions (such as myalgia, \nmyopathy, and/or spasm). \n \nTable 1 Recommended dose modifications and management for symptomatic CK elevations and \n\nmuscle-related adverse reactions \n \n\nSeverity of CK elevation Dose modifications* and management \nrecommendations \n\nGrade 1 \n[CK elevation >ULN - 2.5 x ULN] \n\n\u2022 Continue treatment at the same dose and \nmonitor CK levels weekly until resolution \nto baseline level and then monthly \nthereafter. Monitor muscle symptoms for \nchanges until resolution to baseline. \n\n\u2022 Check renal function (serum creatinine) \nregularly and ensure that patient is \nadequately hydrated. \n\nGrade 2 without renal impairment \n(serum Cr \u2264 ULN) \n[CK elevation >2.5 x ULN - 5 x ULN] \n\n\u2022 Interrupt treatment and monitor CK levels \nweekly until resolution to baseline level. \n\n\u2022 Monitor muscle symptoms for changes \nuntil resolution to baseline. Upon \nresolution, resume treatment at the same \ndose level and measure CK monthly \nthereafter. \n\n\u2022 Check renal function (serum creatinine) \nregularly and ensure that the patient is \nadequately hydrated. \n\n\u2022 If symptoms re-occur, interrupt treatment \nuntil resolution to baseline. Re-introduce \nsonidegib at 200 mg every other day and \nfollow the same monitoring \nrecommendations. If symptoms persist \ndespite alternate-day dosing, consider \ndiscontinuing treatment. \n\nGrade 3 or 4 without renal impairment \n(serum Cr \u2264 ULN) \n[Grade 3 (CK elevation >5 x ULN - 10 x ULN)] \n[Grade 4 (CK elevation >10 x ULN)] \n\n\u2022 Interrupt treatment and monitor CK levels \nweekly until resolution to baseline. \nMonitor muscle symptoms for changes \nuntil resolution to baseline. \n\n\u2022 Check renal function (serum creatinine) \nregularly and ensure that patient is \nadequately hydrated. \n\n\u2022 If renal function is not impaired and CK \nresolves to baseline, consider resuming \ntreatment at 200 mg every other day. CK \nlevels should be measured weekly for \n2 months after re-administration of \nsonidegib and monthly thereafter. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGrade 2, 3 or 4 with renal impairment \n(serum Cr > ULN) \n\n\u2022 If renal function is impaired, interrupt \ntreatment and ensure that the patient is \nadequately hydrated and evaluate other \nsecondary causes of renal impairment. \n\n\u2022 Monitor CK and serum creatinine levels \nweekly until resolution to baseline. \nMonitor muscle symptoms for changes \nuntil resolution to baseline. \n\n\u2022 If CK and serum creatinine levels return to \nbaseline consider resuming treatment at \n200 mg every other day and measure CK \nlevels weekly for 2 months and monthly \nthereafter; otherwise discontinue treatment \npermanently. \n\n \n* The above recommendations for dose modifications are based on the Common Terminology Criteria \n\nfor Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03, developed by the National Cancer Institute (USA). The CTCAE \nis a standardised classification of adverse events used in assessing medicinal products for cancer \ntherapy. \n\nCr: creatinine; ULN: upper limit of normal \n \nOther dose modifications \nManagement of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruption (with or \nwithout a subsequent dose reduction) or discontinuation. \n \nWhen dose interruption is required, consider resuming Odomzo at the same dose after resolution of the \nadverse reaction to \u2264 grade 1. \n \nIf dose reduction is required, then the dose should be reduced to 200 mg every other day. If the same adverse \ndrug reaction occurs following the switch to alternate daily dosing and does not improve, consider \ndiscontinuing treatment with Odomzo. \n \nDue to the long half-life of sonidegib the full effect of a dose interruption or dose adjustment of sonidegib on \nseveral adverse reactions is expected to generally occur after a few weeks (see section 5.2). \n \nDuration of treatment \nIn clinical studies, treatment with Odomzo was continued until disease progression or until unacceptable \ntoxicity. Treatment interruptions of up to 3 weeks were allowed based on individual tolerability. \n \nBenefit of continued treatment should be regularly assessed, with the optimal duration of therapy varying for \neach individual patient. \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nSonidegib has not been studied in a dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment. \nBased on the available data, sonidegib elimination via the kidney is negligible. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis found that mild or moderate renal impairment did not have a significant effect on \nthe apparent clearance (CL/F) of sonidegib, suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with \nrenal impairment (see section 5.2). No efficacy and safety data are available in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly (\u226565 years) \nSafety and efficacy data in patients aged 65 years and older do not suggest that a dose adjustment is required \nin these patients (see section 5.2). \n\nhttp://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Odomzo in children and adolescents aged below 18 years with basal cell \ncarcinoma have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOdomzo is for oral use. The capsules must be swallowed whole. They must not be chewed or crushed. The \ncapsules must not be opened due to risk of teratogenicity (see section 5.3). \n \nOdomzo must be taken at least two hours after a meal and at least one hour before the following meal to \nprevent increased risk of adverse reactions due to higher exposure of sonidegib when taken with a meal (see \nsection 5.2). If vomiting occurs during the course of the treatment, then no re-dosing of the patient is allowed \nbefore the next scheduled dose. \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as this is realised, unless more than six hours have passed since \nit was scheduled to be taken; in this case, the patient should wait and take the next scheduled dose. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential who do not comply with the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMuscle-related adverse reactions \n \nIn the phase II pivotal study, muscle spasms, myalgia, myopathy and cases of CK elevations were observed. \nThe majority of patients treated with Odomzo 200 mg daily who had grade 2 or higher CK elevations \ndeveloped muscle symptoms prior to the CK elevations. For most patients, muscle symptoms and CK \nelevations resolved with appropriate management. \n \nAll patients starting therapy with Odomzo must be informed of the risk of muscle-related adverse reactions, \nincluding the possibility of rhabdomyolysis. They must be instructed to report promptly any unexplained \nmuscle pain, tenderness or weakness occurring during treatment with Odomzo or if symptoms persist after \ndiscontinuing treatment. \n \nCK levels should be checked prior to starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter, e.g. if \nmuscle-related symptoms are reported. If clinically notable elevation of CK is detected, renal function should \nbe assessed (see section 4.2). \n \nDose modification or interruption guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). Management of \nhigh-grade CK elevation using supportive therapy, including proper hydration, should be considered \naccording to local standards of medical practice and treatment guidelines. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for muscle-related symptoms if Odomzo is used in combination with \ncertain medicinal products that may increase the potential risk of developing muscle toxicity (e.g. CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, fibric acid derivatives, penicillamine, zidovudine, niacin and \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic \nlateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy) must be closely monitored due to an increased risk of muscle \ntoxicity. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nEmbryofoetal death or severe birth defects \n \nOdomzo may cause embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects when administered to pregnant women. \nBased on the mechanism of action, in animal studies, sonidegib has been shown to be teratogenic and \nfoetotoxic. Women taking Odomzo must not be pregnant or become pregnant during treatment and for \n20 months after ending treatment. \n \nCriteria defining a woman of childbearing potential \n \nA woman of childbearing potential is defined in the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme as a sexually \nmature female who \n\u2022 has menstruated at any time during the previous 12 consecutive months, \n\u2022 has not undergone a hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy, or who does not have \n\nmedically-confirmed permanent premature ovarian failure, \n\u2022 does not have a XY genotype, Turner\u2019s syndrome or uterine agenesis, \n\u2022 becomes amenorrhoeic following cancer therapy, including treatment with Odomzo. \n \nCounselling \n \nFor women of childbearing potential \nOdomzo is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who do not comply with the Odomzo \nPregnancy Prevention Programme. A woman of childbearing potential must understand that: \n\u2022 Odomzo exposes a teratogenic risk to the unborn child. \n\u2022 She must not take Odomzo if she is pregnant or plans to become pregnant. \n\u2022 She must have a negative pregnancy test, conducted by a healthcare professional within 7 days before \n\nstarting Odomzo treatment. \n\u2022 She must have a negative pregnancy test monthly during treatment, even if she has become \n\namenorrhoeic. \n\u2022 She must not become pregnant while taking Odomzo and for 20 months after her final dose. \n\u2022 She must be able to comply with effective contraceptive measures. \n\u2022 She must use 2 methods of recommended contraception (see the \u201cContraception\u201d section below and \n\nsection 4.6) while she is taking Odomzo, unless she commits to not having sexual intercourse \n(abstinence). \n\n\u2022 She must tell her healthcare provider if any of the following occur during treatment and during the \n20 months after her final dose: \no she becomes pregnant or thinks for any reason that she may be pregnant, \no she misses her expected menstrual period, \no she stops using contraception unless she commits to not having sexual intercourse (abstinence), \no she needs to change contraception. \n\n\u2022 She must not breast-feed while taking Odomzo and for 20 months after the final dose. \n \nFor men \nSonidegib may pass into the semen. To avoid potential foetal exposure during pregnancy, a male patient \nmust understand that: \n\u2022 Odomzo exposes a teratogenic risk to the unborn child if he engages in unprotected sexual activity \n\nwith a pregnant woman. \n\u2022 He must always use the recommended contraception (see the \u201cContraception\u201d section below and \n\nsection 4.6). \n\u2022 He will tell his healthcare provider if his female partner becomes pregnant while he is taking Odomzo \n\nor during the 6 months after his final dose. \n \nFor healthcare professionals \nHealthcare professionals must educate patients so they understand and acknowledge all the conditions of the \nOdomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nContraception \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential must use two methods of recommended contraception, including one \nhighly effective method and a barrier method, while taking Odomzo and for 20 months after ending \ntreatment (see section 4.6). \n \nMen \nMale patients, even those who have had a vasectomy, must always use a condom (with spermicide, if \navailable) when having sex with a female partner while taking Odomzo and for 6 months after ending \ntreatment (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \nPregnancy testing \n \nThe pregnancy status of women of child-bearing potential must be established within 7 days prior to the \ninitiation of Odomzo treatment and monthly during treatment by means of a test performed by a healthcare \nprofessional. Pregnancy tests should have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/ml as per local availability. In \nthe event of pregnancy, treatment must not be initiated. In case of pregnancy occurring during treatment, \nOdomzo must be stopped immediately (see section 5.3). Patients who present with amenorrhoea during \ntreatment with Odomzo should continue monthly pregnancy testing while on treatment. \n \nPrescribing and dispensing restrictions for women of childbearing potential \n \nThe initial prescription and dispensing of Odomzo should occur within 7 days of a negative pregnancy test. \nPrescriptions of Odomzo should be limited to 30 days of treatment, with continuation of treatment requiring \na new prescription. \n \nEducational material \n \nIn order to help healthcare providers and patients avoid embryonic and foetal exposure to Odomzo, the \nMarketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials (Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme) to reinforce the potential risks associated with use of the medicinal product. \n \nBlood donation \n \nPatients should be instructed not to donate blood while taking Odomzo and for at least 20 months after \nending treatment. \n \nSemen donation \n \nMale patients should not donate semen while taking Odomzo and for at least 6 months after ending \ntreatment. \n \nPremature fusion of the epiphyses \nPremature fusion of the epiphyses has been reported in paediatric patients exposed to Hedgehog \n(Hh) pathway inhibitors. In some cases, fusion progressed after drug discontinuation (see section 4.8). \n \nInteractions \n \nConcomitant treatment with strong CYP inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine or phenytoin) should be \navoided, as a risk for decreased plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of sonidegib cannot be \nexcluded (see also section 4.5). \n \nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) \n \nPatients with advanced BCC have an increased risk of developing cuSCC. Cases of cuSCC have been \nreported in advanced BCC patients treated with Odomzo. It has not been determined whether cuSCC is \n\n\n\n8 \n\nrelated to Odomzo treatment. Therefore, all patients should be monitored routinely while taking Odomzo, \nand cuSCC should be treated according to the standard of care. \n \nAdditional precautions \n \nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person. Any capsules that \nremain unused at the end of treatment should immediately be disposed of by the patient in accordance with \nlocal requirements (e.g. by returning the capsules to their pharmacist or physician). \n \nExcipients \n \nOdomzo capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSonidegib undergoes metabolism primarily by CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of strong inhibitors \nor inducers of CYP3A4 can increase or decrease sonidegib concentrations significantly. \n \nAgents that may increase sonidegib plasma concentration \n \nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 800 mg dose of sonidegib with ketoconazole (200 mg twice \ndaily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in a 2.25-fold and a 1.49-fold increase in sonidegib \nAUC and Cmax, respectively, compared with sonidegib alone. Longer duration of concomitant use of \nCYP3A4 strong inhibitors (e.g. more than 14 days) will lead to a larger fold change in sonidegib exposure \nbased on simulation. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is required, the sonidegib dose should \nbe reduced to 200 mg every other day. Strong CYP3A inhibitors include, but are not limited to, ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and nefazodone. Patients \nshould be carefully monitored for adverse events if one of these agents is used together with sonidegib. \n \nAgents that may decrease sonidegib plasma concentration \n \nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single dose of 800 mg sonidegib with rifampicin (600 mg daily for \n14 days), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 72% and 54% decreases in sonidegib AUC and Cmax \nrespectively, compared with when sonidegib was given alone. Co-administration of sonidegib with strong \nCYP3A inducers decreases sonidegib plasma concentration. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers \nshould be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, \nrifampicin and St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be used \nconcomitantly with sonidegib, consideration should be given to increasing the daily dose of sonidegib to \n400-800 mg. This dose of sonidegib is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers \nbased on pharmacokinetic data when the concomitant treatment with the inducer is no longer than 14 days. \nLonger concomitant treatment with inducer is not recommended because sonidegib exposure will be \ndecreased and this may compromise efficacy. The dose of sonidegib used prior to initiation of the strong \ninducer should be resumed if the strong inducer is discontinued. \n \nResults from a clinical study demonstrated a change in sonidegib exposure (32% and 38% decrease in AUC \nand Cmax) after co-administration of a single dose of Odomzo 200 mg with esomeprazole (a proton pump \ninhibitor) at 40 mg daily for 6 days in healthy subjects. This interaction is not expected to be clinically \nsignificant. \n \nEffects of sonidegib on other medicinal products \n \nSonidegib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 in vitro. However, results of a drug-drug \ninteraction study in cancer patients demonstrate that the systemic exposure of bupropion (a CYP2B6 \nsubstrate) and warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) is not altered when co-administered with sonidegib. Sonidegib \nis also a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor (IC50 ~1.5\u00b5M). Patients concomitantly using \n\n\n\n9 \n\nsubstrates of BCRP transporters should be carefully monitored for adverse drug reactions. Substances that \nare BCRP substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, irinotecan, topotecan) \nshould be avoided. \n \nAgents that may increase muscle-related  adverse reactions \n \nDue to overlapping toxicities, patients taking Odomzo who are also taking medicinal products known to \nincrease the risk of muscle-related toxicity may be at increased risk of developing muscle-related adverse \nreactions. Patients should be closely monitored and dose adjustments should be considered if muscle \nsymptoms develop. \n \nIn the phase II pivotal trial, 12 (15.2%) patients treated with Odomzo 200 mg took concomitant HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors (9 took pravastatin, 3 took non-pravastatin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors including \nrosuvastatin and simvastatin). Of these patients, 7 (58.3%) had up to grade 1 muscle symptoms while 43 \n(64.1%) patients not taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors experienced up to grade 3 symptoms. No patient \ntaking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors experienced grade 3/4 CK elevations, as opposed to 6 (9.0%) patients \nnot taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. \n \nFood interaction \n \nThe bioavailability of sonidegib is increased in the presence of food (see section 5.2). Odomzo must be taken \nat least two hours after a meal and at least one hour before the following meal. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nDue to the risk of embryofoetal death or severe birth defects caused by sonidegib, women taking Odomzo \nmust not be pregnant or become pregnant during treatment and for 20 months after ending treatment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nOdomzo is contraindicated in woman of childbearing potential who do not comply with the Odomzo \nPregnancy Prevention Programme (see section 4.3). \n \nIn case of pregnancy or missed menstrual periods \nIf the patient does become pregnant, misses a menstrual period, or suspects for any reason that she may be \npregnant, she must notify her treating physician immediately. \n \nPersistent lack of menses during treatment with Odomzo should be assumed to indicate pregnancy until \nmedical evaluation and confirmation. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must be able to comply with effective contraceptive measures. They must \nuse two methods of recommended contraception, including one highly effective method and a barrier \nmethod, during Odomzo therapy and for 20 months after the final dose. Women of childbearing potential \nwhose periods are irregular or have stopped must follow all the advice on effective contraception. \n \nMen \nIt is unknown whether sonidegib is contained in semen. Men should not father a child or donate semen while \ntaking Odomzo and for at least 6 months after ending treatment. To avoid potential foetal exposure during \npregnancy, male patients, even those who have had a vasectomy, must always use a condom (with \nspermicide, if available) when having sex with a female partner while taking Odomzo and for 6 months after \nthe final dose. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe following are recommended forms of highly effective methods \n\u2022 Tubal sterilisation \n\u2022 Vasectomy \n\u2022 Intrauterine device (IUD) \n \nThe following are recommended barrier methods \n\u2022 Any male condom (with spermicide, if available) \n\u2022 Diaphragm (with spermicide, if available) \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of sonidegib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown teratogenicity \nand foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). Odomzo is contraindicated during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether sonidegib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse drug \nreactions, such as serious developmental defects in breast-fed newborns/infants from sonidegib, women must \nnot breast-feed while taking Odomzo or for 20 months after ending treatment (see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nData from studies in rats and dogs indicate that male and female fertility may be irreversibly compromised \nby treatment with Odomzo (see section 5.3). Additionally, amenorrhoea has been observed in clinical studies \nin women of childbearing potential (see section 4.8). Fertility preservation strategies should be discussed \nwith women of childbearing potential prior to starting treatment with Odomzo. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOdomzo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe phase II pivotal study evaluated the safety of Odomzo in a total of 229 adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic BCC. Patients were treated with Odomzo 200 mg daily (n=79) or with Odomzo \n800 mg daily (n=150). The median duration of treatment was 11.0 months for patients treated with Odomzo \nat the recommended dose of 200 mg (range 1.3 to 41.3 months). One death occurred while on treatment or \nwithin 30 days of the last dose taken in either metastatic BCC or locally advanced BCC patients taking \nOdomzo 200 mg. \n \nThe most common adverse drug reactions occurring in \u226510% of patients treated with Odomzo 200 mg were \nmuscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhoea, weight decreased, \ndecreased appetite, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, pain, vomiting and pruritus. \n \nThe most common grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients treated with Odomzo \n200 mg were fatigue, weight decreased and muscle spasms. \n \nAmong adverse drug reactions reported (Table 2), the frequency was greater in patients taking Odomzo \n800 mg than in patients taking Odomzo 200 mg except for musculoskeletal pain, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, \nheadache and pruritus. This was also true for grade 3/4 adverse reactions, except fatigue. \n \nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions for the recommended dose from the phase II pivotal clinical study (Table 2) are listed \nby Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18 system organ class. Within each \n\n\n\n11 \n\nsystem organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions \nfirst. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the \nfollowing convention (CIOMS III): very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nTable 2 Adverse drug reactions observed in the phase II pivotal study \n \n\nPrimary system organ class \nPreferred term \n\nFrequency all grades \n200 mg \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nDecreased appetite Very common \nDehydration Common \nNervous system disorders \nDysgeusia Very common \nHeadache Very common \nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea Very common \nDiarrhoea Very common \nAbdominal pain Very common \nVomiting Very common \nDyspepsia Common \nConstipation Common \nGastro-oesophageal reflux disorder Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAlopecia Very common \nPruritus Very common \nRash Common \nAbnormal hair growth Common \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMuscle spasms Very common \nMusculoskeletal pain Very common \nMyalgia Very common \nMyopathy \n[muscular fatigue and muscular weakness] \n\nCommon \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \nAmenorrhoea* Very common \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nFatigue Very common \nPain Very common \nInvestigations \nWeight decreased Very common \n* Of the 79 patients receiving Odomzo 200 mg, 5 were women of childbearing age. Among these women, \namenorrhoea was observed in 1 patient (20%). \n\n \nClinically relevant laboratory abnormalities \n \nThe most commonly reported grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities with an incidence of  \u2265 5% occurring in \n\n\n\n12 \n\npatients treated with Odomzo 200 mg were lipase increase and blood CK increase (Table 3). \n \nTable 3 Laboratory abnormalities* \n \n\nLaboratory test Frequency all grades \n200 mg \n\nHaematological parameters \nHaemoglobin decreased Very common \nLymphocyte count decreased Very common \nBiochemistry parameters  \nSerum creatinine increased Very common \nSerum creatine phosphokinase (CK) increased Very common \nBlood glucose increased Very common \nLipase increased Very common \nAlanine amino transaminase (ALT) increased Very common \nAspartate amino transaminase (AST) increased Very common \nAmylase increased Very common \n* Based on worst laboratory value post-treatment regardless of baseline, grading by CTCAE version 4.03 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nMuscle-related adverse reactions including CK elevation \nMuscle toxicity is the most clinically relevant side effect reported in patients receiving sonidegib therapy and \nis believed to be a class effect of inhibitors of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. In the phase II pivotal \nstudy muscle spasms were the most common \u201cmuscle-related\u201d adverse reactions, and were reported in fewer \npatients in the Odomzo 200 mg group (54%) than in the Odomzo 800 mg group (69%). \n \nGrade 3/4 increase in blood CK was reported in 8% of patients taking Odomzo 200 mg. The majority of \npatients who had grade 2 or higher CK elevations developed muscle symptoms prior to the CK elevations. In \nthese patients, increases in laboratory values of CK to grade 2 and higher severity had a median time to onset \nof 12.9 weeks (range 2 to 39 weeks) after initiating Odomzo therapy and a median time to resolution (to \nnormalisation or grade 1) of 12 days (95% CI 8 to 14 days). \n \nOne patient receiving Odomzo 200 mg experienced muscle symptoms and CK elevations above 10x ULN \nand required intravenous fluids, compared to 6 patients receiving Odomzo 800 mg. \n \nIn the phase II pivotal study, no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis were confirmed (defined as CK levels \n>10-fold above the pre-treatment or baseline level or >10x ULN if no baseline level reported plus a 1.5-fold \nincrease in serum creatinine from the pre-treatment or baseline level). However, one reported case in a \npatient treated with Odomzo 800 mg in a non-pivotal study was confirmed. \n \nAmenorrhoea \nIn the phase II pivotal study, 2 (14.3%) out of 14 women of either child-bearing potential or of child-bearing \nage sterilised by tubal ligation developed amenorrhoea while on treatment with Odomzo 200 mg or 800 mg \nonce daily. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe evaluation of safety in the paediatric population is based on data from 16 adult and 60 paediatric patients \nfrom Study CLDE225X2104 and 16 adult and 2 paediatric patients from Study CLDE225C2301. The \nmedian duration of exposure to sonidegib during Study X2104 was 97 days (range 34 to 511 days) for adult \npatients and 55 days (range 2 to 289 days) for paediatric patients. The median duration of exposure to \nsonidegib during Study C2301 was 2.8 months (range 0.4 to 33.2 months) for adult patients and 3.5 months \n(range 1.3 to 5.7 months) for paediatric patients. \nThe toxicity of sonidegib as observed in studies C2301 and X2104 in adults was in line with the already \nknown treatment related toxicity reported in adult patients with basal cell carcinoma.  \nThe sonidegib-related toxicity reported in paediatric patients was similar to the results reported in adults, \n\n\n\n13 \n\nwith the exceptions of a reduced incidence of muscle toxicity (e.g. CK elevations observed in 16.7% of \npaediatric patients compared with 50% of adults in study X2104) and the observation of post-natal \ndevelopment effect particularly with prolonged exposure (reported as cases of epiphyseal plate of phalanx \ndisorder, knee subchondral condensation of area of growth plate, physeal distal femur disorder, \nchondropathy, and chipped tooth). \n \nPremature fusion of the epiphyses \nThree cases (one case of cartilage injury, one case of epiphyseal disorder and one case of epiphyseal fracture) \nof epiphyseal growth plate disorders were reported in paediatric patients treated with sonidegib during \nclinical studies but causal association with sonidegib cannot be ascertained conclusively. Premature fusion of \nthe epiphyses has been reported in paediatric patients exposed to Hh (Hedgehog) pathway inhibitors. \nOdomzo should not be used in paediatric patients as safety and effectiveness is not established in this \npopulation. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn dose escalation studies, Odomzo was administered at doses up to 3000 mg orally once daily. Patients \nshould be monitored closely for adverse events and given appropriate supportive measures in all cases of \noverdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX48 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSonidegib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the Hh signalling pathway. It binds to Smoothened (Smo), a \nG protein-coupled receptor-like molecule that positively regulates the Hh pathway and eventually activates \nand releases glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) transcription factors which induces the transcription of Hh \ntarget genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and survival. Aberrant Hh signalling has been linked to \nthe pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Sonidegib binding to Smo \nwill inhibit Hh signalling and consequently block signal transduction. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe sonidegib plasma concentration-QTc analysis showed that the upper bound of one-sided 95% confidence \ninterval for QTc increase was below 5 msec at steady-state Cmax for 800 mg daily doses, which provide \n2.3-fold plasma exposure compared with the recommended 200 mg dose. Therefore, therapeutic doses of \nOdomzo are not expected to cause clinically significant QTc prolongation. Further, sonidegib plasma \nconcentrations above those achieved with the therapeutic doses were not associated with life-threatening \narrhythmias or torsades de pointes. \n \nTumour response was independent of Odomzo dose or plasma concentration in the dose range of 200 mg to \n800 mg. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA phase II, randomised double-blind study of two dose levels (200 mg or 800 mg once daily) of Odomzo \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\nwas conducted in 230 patients with either locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) (n=194) or \nmetastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC) (n=36). Of the 230 patients, 16 had a diagnosis of Gorlin Syndrome \n(15 laBCC and 1 mBCC). Adult (\u226518 years of age) patients with laBCC or mBCC who were not candidates \nfor radiotherapy, surgery or other local therapies, were randomised to receive Odomzo at either 200 mg or \n800 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was objective response rate according to modified Response \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) in patients with laBCC and RECIST 1.1 in patients with \nmBCC as determined by central review. The secondary endpoints included duration of response, time to \ntumour response and progression free survival (PFS) according to mRECIST in patients with laBCC and \nRECIST 1.1 in patients with mBCC as determined by central review. \n \nFor patients with laBCC, the Independent Review Committee (IRC) Composite Overall Response was \nintegrated from centrally evaluated MRI scans, digital clinical photographs and histopathology according to \nmRECIST. For LaBCC, multiple punch biopsies were taken each time a response assessment was \nconfounded by presence of lesion ulceration, cyst, and or scarring/fibrosis. MRI tumour response was \nevaluated by RECIST 1.1. Response by digital clinical photograph was evaluated by World Health \nOrganization (WHO) adapted criteria [partial response (PR): \u226550% decrease in the sum of the product of \nperpendicular diameters (SPD) of a lesion; complete response (CR): disappearance of all lesions; progressive \ndisease: \u226525% increase in the SPD of lesions]. For a composite Complete Response, all modalities used for \nassessment had to demonstrate absence of tumour. \n \nOf the 230 patients randomised, 79 patients were assigned to Odomzo 200 mg. Of these 79 patients, 66 \n(83.5%) were laBCC patients (37 [46.8%] with aggressive histology and 29 [36.7%] with non-aggressive \nhistology) and 13 (16.5%) were mBCC patients. The median age of all patients receiving Odomzo 200 mg \nwas 67 years (59.5% were >65 years of age), 60.8% were male and 89.9% Caucasian. \n \nThe majority of patients (laBCC 74%, mBCC 92%) had undergone prior therapies including surgery (laBCC \n73%, mBCC 85%), radiotherapy (laBCC 18%, mBCC 54%) and antineoplastic therapies (laBCC 23%, \nmBCC 23%). \n \nThe key efficacy results per central review and local investigator assessment are presented in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 Efficacy overview per central review and local investigator assessment by FASa \n \n\n Odomzo 200 mg \n Central Local investigator \n laBCC laBCC \n N=66 N=66 \nObjective response rate, n (%) 37 (56.1) 47 (71.2) \n 95% CI (43.3, 68.3) (58.7, 81.7) \nBest overall response, n (%)   \n Complete response 3 (4.5)b 6 (9.1) \n Partial response 34 (51.5) 41 (62.1) \n Disease stabilisation 23 (34.8) 13 (19.7) \n Disease progression 1 (1.5) 1 (1.5) \n Unknown 5 (7.6) 5 (7.6) \nTime to tumour response (months)   \nMedian 4.0 2.5 \n 95% CI (3.8, 5.6) (1.9, 3.7) \nDuration of response   \nNo. of events* 11 22 \nNo. censored 26 25 \nMedian (months) 26.1 15.7 \n 95% CI (NE) (12.0,20.2) \nEvent-free probability (%), (95% CI)   \n 6 months 86.4 (67.7, 94.7) 89.8 (74.8, 96.1) \n 9 months 74.9 (54.4, 87.2) 80.7 (63.5, 90.4) \n 12 months 64.9 (42.3,80.4) 71.4 (53.1, 83.6) \n\n\n\n15 \n\nProgression-free survival   \nNo. of events* 16 28 \nNo. censored 50 38 \nMedian (months) 22.1 19.4 \n 95% CI (NE) (16.6, 23.6) \nProgression-free survival probability (%), (95% CI)   \n 6 months 94.8 (84.6, 98.3) 94.7 (84.5, 98.3) \n 12 months 82.0 (66.7, 90.7) 75.5 (60.7, 85.4) \na Full analysis set included all randomised patients (intent-to-treat population). \nb Using only negative histology to define CR among patients who have at least a PR from other modalities \n(MRI or photography) resulted in a CR rate of 21.2%. \n*Event refers to disease progression or death due to any reason. \nFAS: Full analysis set \nCI: confidence interval \nNE: not estimable \n\n \nFigures 1 shows the best change in target lesion size for each patient with laBCC at the dose of 200 mg per \ncentral review. \n \nFigure 1 Best change from baseline in the target lesions of laBCC patients per central \n\nreview assessment by FAS \n\n \n \nPatient-reported outcomes were evaluated as an exploratory endpoint using the European Organisation for \nResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its \nassociated head and neck cancer specific module (H&N35). \n \nThe majority of patients experienced maintenance and/or improvement in their disease-related symptoms, \nfunctioning, and health status.

Study CLDE225X2104 was a Phase I/II study of sonidegib in paediatric patients with recurrent or \nrefractory medulloblastoma or other tumours potentially dependent on the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling \npathway and adult patients with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma. Study CLDE225C2301 was a \nPhase II, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of oral sonidegib in patients \nwith Hh-activated relapsed medulloblastoma. Results show a lack of significant efficacy despite the \nenrichment strategy focussed on Hh-activated medulloblastoma. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing the administration of a single dose of Odomzo (100 mg to 3000 mg) without food in patients with \ncancer, the median time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was 2 to 4 hours. Sonidegib exhibited \ndose-proportional increases in AUC and Cmax over the dose range from 100 mg to 400 mg, but less than \ndose-proportional increases above 400 mg. There was no evidence of clearance change with repeated dosing \nbased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis and estimated accumulation at steady state was 19-fold \nirrespective of dose. Steady state was reached approximately 4 months after starting sonidegib. The average \nsteady state Ctrough for 200 mg was 830 ng/ml (range 200 to 2400 ng/ml) in cancer patients. Compared to the \nfasted state, the Cmax and AUC of Odomzo 800 mg was increased 7.8- and 7.4-fold, respectively when the \ndose was given with a high-fat meal. Compared to the fasted state, the Cmax and AUC of Odomzo 200 mg \nwas increased 2.8- and 3.5-fold, respectively, when the dose was given with a light meal. Compared to the \nfasted state, the Cmax and AUC of Odomzo 200 mg increased 1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively, when a \nmoderate meal was taken 2 hours before the administration. A moderate meal taken 1 hour after the \nadministration of Odomzo 200 mg provided similar exposures compared to the fasted state. \n \nDistribution \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 351 patients who received oral doses of Odomzo in the \ndose range of 100 mg to 3000 mg, the apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 9170 litres. \nSteady-state level of sonidegib in the skin was 6-fold higher than in plasma. \n \nSonidegib was highly bound to human plasma proteins (human serum albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein) in vitro (>97%), and binding was not concentration-dependent from 1 ng/ml to 2500 ng/ml. \n \nBased on in vitro data, sonidegib is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP or multi-resistance protein 2 (MRP2). \nSonidegib did not inhibit apical efflux transporters, P-gp or MRP2, hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 or \nOATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the organic cation uptake \ntransporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSonidegib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Unchanged sonidegib represented 36% of circulating \nradioactivity and the major circulating metabolite (45% of parent exposure) identified in plasma is the \nhydrolysis product of sonidegib and is pharmacologically inactive. All the metabolites were deemed 4 to \n90 times less potent than sonidegib. \n \nElimination \n \nSonidegib and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the hepatic route with 93.4% of the administered \ndose recovered in the faeces and 1.95% recovered in urine. Unchanged sonidegib in faeces represented \n\n\n\n17 \n\n88.7% of the administered dose and was not detectable in urine. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of sonidegib \nestimated from population pharmacokinetic modeling was approximately 28 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of sonidegib were examined in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A; n=8), \nmoderate (Child-Pugh class B; n=8) or severe (Child-Pugh class C; n=9) hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy \nsubjects with normal hepatic function. Cmax of sonidegib after a single oral 800 mg dose was 20%, 21% and \n60% lower in mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to normal hepatic \nfunction. AUCinf of sonidegib was 40%, 22% and 8% lower, respectively. AUClast was 35% lower in mild \nhepatic impairment, 14% higher in moderate hepatic impairment and 23% lower in severe hepatic \nimpairment. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on the systemic exposure of sonidegib has not been studied. Since sonidegib \nis not renally excreted, no change in systemic exposure is anticipated in patients with renal impairment. A \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis did not find significant influence of renal function (creatinine clearance \n>27 ml/min) on the apparent clearance (CL/F) of sonidegib suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary \nin patients with renal impairment. \n \nEffect of age, weight and gender \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age (range tested \nfrom 20-93 years, mean 61 years), body weight (range tested 42-181 kg, mean 77 kg), gender, or creatinine \nclearance (range tested 27.3-290 ml/min, mean 92.9 ml/min) on the systemic exposure of sonidegib. \n \nEffect of ethnicity \nThe Cmax and AUCinf of sonidegib in Japanese healthy subjects were 1.56 and 1.68-fold higher, respectively, \nthan those seen in Western healthy subjects for a single dose of 200 mg. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSonidegib was evaluated in rats and dogs. \n \nGeneral toxicology \n \nThe majority of adverse effects of sonidegib can be attributed to its pharmacological mechanism of action on \ndevelopmental pathways and effects in rats and dogs were similar. Most effects occurred close to the \nintended human exposures. These effects observed at clinically relevant exposures include closure of bone \ngrowth plates, effects on growing teeth, effects on the male and female reproductive tract, atrophy of the hair \nfollicles with alopecia, gastrointestinal toxicity with body weight loss and effects on lymph nodes. At \nexposures well above the clinical exposure, an additional target organ was the kidney. \n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sonidegib, but sonidegib was not genotoxic in studies \nconducted in vitro and in vivo. \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity \n \nSonidegib was shown to be foetotoxic in rabbits, as evidenced by abortion and/or complete resorption of \nfoetuses and teratogenic resulting in severe malformations at very low exposure. Teratogenic effects \nincluded vertebral, distal limb and digit malformations, severe craniofacial malformations and other severe \nmidline defects. Foetotoxicity in rabbits was also seen at very low maternal exposure. There was reduced \nfertility at low exposure in female rats. For sonidegib-treated male rats, exposure at approx. 2-fold the \nclinical exposure did not impact male fertility. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n6.

It may lead to the death of a baby before it is born or shortly after \nbeing born. You must not become pregnant while taking this medicine. You must follow the contraception \ninstructions contained in this leaflet. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Odomzo \n3. How to take Odomzo \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Odomzo \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Odomzo is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Odomzo is \n \nOdomzo contains the active substance sonidegib. It is an anti-cancer medicine. \n \nWhat Odomzo is used for \n \nOdomzo is used to treat adults with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. It is used when the \ncancer has spread locally and cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. \n \nHow Odomzo works \n \nThe normal growth of cells is controlled by various chemical signals. In patients with basal cell carcinoma, \nchanges occur to genes controlling a part of this process known as the \u201chedgehog pathway\u201d. This switches on \nsignals that make the cancer cells grow out of control. Odomzo works by blocking this process, stopping \ncancer cells from growing and making new cells. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Odomzo \n \nRead the specific instructions given to you by your doctor, particularly on the effects of Odomzo on unborn \nbabies. \n \nRead carefully and follow the instructions of the patient brochure and reminder card given to you by your \ndoctor. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nDo not take Odomzo \n\u2022 if you are allergic to sonidegib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. This is because Odomzo may cause harm or death to \n\nyour unborn baby (see section \u201cPregnancy\u201d). \n\u2022 if you are breast-feeding. This is because it is not known whether Odomzo can pass into your breast \n\nmilk and cause harm to your baby (see section \u201cBreast-feeding\u201d). \n\u2022 if you are able to become pregnant but are unable or unwilling to follow the necessary pregnancy \n\nprevention measures that are listed in the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme. \nDo not take Odomzo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist \nbefore taking Odomzo. \n \nAdditional information on the above points can be found in the sections \u201cPregnancy\u201d, \u201cBreast-feeding\u201d, \n\u201cFertility\u201d and \u201cContraception for women and men\u201d. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n- Odomzo may cause muscle problems. Tell your doctor before taking Odomzo if you have a history of \n\nmuscle cramps or weakness or if you are taking other medicines. Some medicines (e.g. medicines used \nto treat high cholesterol) might increase the risk for muscle problems. Tell your doctor or pharmacist \nimmediately if your muscles hurt or you have unexplained muscle cramps or weakness during \ntreatment with Odomzo. Your doctor may need to change your dose, or stop your treatment \ntemporarily or permanently. \n\n- You should not donate blood while on treatment with Odomzo and for 20 months after ending your \ntreatment. \n\n- If you are male, you should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 6 months after the \nfinal dose. \n\n- Your doctor will check your skin regularly for another type of cancer called cutaneous squamous cell \ncarcinoma (SCC). It is not known whether SCC can be related to treatment with Odomzo. Usually this \ntype of cancer appears on sun-damaged skin, does not spread and can be cured. Tell your doctor if you \nnotice any changes in your skin. \n\n- Never give this medicine to anyone else. You should return unused capsules at the end of your \ntreatment. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist regarding where to return the capsules. \n\n \nBlood tests during treatment with Odomzo \nYour doctor will perform blood tests before treatment, and possibly during treatment as well. These tests will \ncheck the health of your muscles by measuring the levels of an enzyme in your blood called creatine \nphosphokinase. \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \nOdomzo should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18. Problems with growing teeth \nand bones were seen with this medicine. Odomzo may cause bones to stop growing in children and \nadolescents. This can also happen after discontinuation of the treatment. \n \nOther medicines and Odomzo \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Odomzo can affect \nthe way some medicines work. Some other medicines can also affect how Odomzo works, or make it more \nlikely that you will have side effects. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\u2022 medicines such as statins and fibric acid derivatives used to treat high cholesterol and lipids \n\u2022 vitamin B3, also known as niacin \n\u2022 medicines such as methotrexate, mitoxantrone, irinotecan, or topotecan used to treat certain types of \n\ncancers or other diseases such as severe joint problems (rheumatoid arthritis) and psoriasis \n\u2022 medicines such as telithromycin, rifampicin or rifabutin used to treat bacterial infections \n\u2022 medicines such as ketoconazole (not including shampoos and creams), itraconazole, posaconazole or \n\nvoriconazole used to treat fungal infections \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\u2022 medicines such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine used to treat parasitic infections as well as \nother diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus \n\n\u2022 medicines such as ritonavir, saquinavir or zidovudine used to treat AIDS or HIV \n\u2022 medicines such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat acute seizures \n\u2022 a medicine called nefazodone used to treat depression \n\u2022 a medicine called penicillamine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis \n\u2022 a herbal medicine called St. John\u2019s wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum) used to treat \n\ndepression. \nIf any of the above apply to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Odomzo. \n \nThese medicines should be used with caution or may need to be avoided during your treatment with \nOdomzo. If you are taking any of these, your doctor might need to prescribe an alternative medicine for you. \n \nDuring your treatment with Odomzo, you should also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are prescribed \nanother medicine that you were not taking before. \n \nPregnancy \nDo not take Odomzo if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant \nduring your treatment or during the 20 months after your treatment has finished. You must stop taking \nOdomzo and talk to your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or suspect you could be pregnant. \nOdomzo may cause your baby to have severe birth defects or lead to the death of your unborn baby. Specific \ninstructions (the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme) given to you by your doctor contain \ninformation particularly on the effects of Odomzo on unborn babies. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during your treatment or during the 20 months after your treatment has finished. It is not \nknown whether Odomzo can pass into your breast milk and cause harm to your baby. \n \nFertility \nOdomzo may have an impact on fertility in men and women.
