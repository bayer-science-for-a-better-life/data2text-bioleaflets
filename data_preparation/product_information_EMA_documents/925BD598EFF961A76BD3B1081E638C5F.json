NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLumark 80 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains 80 GBq lutetium (P177PLu) chloride at activity reference time (ART), \ncorresponding to at most a maximum of 160 microgram of lutetium. The ART is defined as the end of \nproduction. \n \nEach vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 to 5 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 8 to \n400 GBq (at ART). \n \nThe minimal specific activity is 500 GBq/mg lutetium (P177PLu) at the ART.  \n \nLutetium (P177PLu) has a half-life of 6.647 days. Lutetium (P177PLu) is produced by neutron irradiation of \nenriched lutetium (P176PLu). Lutetium (P177PLu) decays by βP-P-emission to stable Hafnium (P177PHf), with the most \nabundant βP-P (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 0.497 MeV. Also low gamma energy is emitted, for \ninstance at 113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It is not intended for direct use in patients. It  must be used only \nfor the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and authorised for \nradiolabelling with this radionuclide. \n   \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLumark is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. \n \nUPosology \n \nThe quantity of Lumark required for radiolabelling and the quantity of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled with lutetium(P177PLu) that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nFor more information concerning the paediatric use of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products refer to \nthe Summary of Products Characteristics/package leaflet of the the particular medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nUMethod of administration  \n \nLumark is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products, which are subsequently administered by \nthe approved route. \nLumark should not be administered directly to the patient. \nLumark is for single-use only. \nFor instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6). \n \nFor information on contraindications to particular lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products prepared \nby radiolabelling with Lumark, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of \neach particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUIndividual benefit/risk justification \n \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered \nshould in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect. Lumark is \nnot to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, \nsuch as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. \n \nUGeneral warnings \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated \nclinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or \nappropriate licences of the competent official authorities.  \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nFor information concerning special warnings and precautions for use of P177PLu-labelled medicinal products \nrefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  \n \nURadiation protection \n \nAdministration of a high activity (7.400 MBq) of the lutetium(P177PLu)-labelled medicinal product results in an \naverage radiation dose rate at 1 m distance from the patient of 4-11 µSv/h after 24 hours. This is below the \nthreshold considered acceptable for discharge from the clinic (20 µSv/h). For a person in the vicinity of the \npatient, assuming continuous exposure at 2 m and infinite biological half-life (no disposal by the patient after \ndischarge from the hospital), this dose rate will result in an overall dose of approximately 0.6 mSv, which is \napproximately one half of the dose limit set for general public (1 mSv/year).  \n \nPrecautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6.  \n \nURenal impairment and haematological disorders \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia \nMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after treatment \nwith lutetium (P177 PLu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours (see section 4.8). \nThis should be taken into account when considering the benefit/risk, especially in patients with possible risk \nfactors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (such as alkylating agents). \n\n \nMyelosuppression \nAnaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur during \nradioligand therapy with lutetium (P177PLu). Most events are mild and transient. In some patients more than \none cell line may be affected. A blood count should be taken at baseline and monitored regularly during \ntreatment, in accordance with clinical guidance. \n \nRenal irradiation \nRadiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been reported \nfollowing peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other radioisotopes. Renal \nfunction including glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and \nrenal protection should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance of the radiolabelled medicinal \nproduct. \n  \nUHepatotoxicity \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in patients with \nliver metastases undergoing treatment with P177PLu peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine \ntumours. Liver function should be monitored regularly during treatment. Dose reduction may be necessary in \naffected patients.  \n \nUHormone release syndromes \n \nThere have been reports of carcinoid crisis and other syndromes associated with release of hormones from \nfunctional neuroendocrine tumours following P177PLu peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, which may be \nrelated to irradiation of tumour cells. Reported symptoms include flushing and diarrhoea associated with \nhypotension. Observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be considered in some cases (e.g. \npatients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of hormonal crises, treatments may include: \nintravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of \nelectrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or vomiting. \n\nUExtravasation \n \nThere have been reports of extravasation of lutetium (P177PLu) labelled ligands in the post-marketing setting. In \ncase of extravasation, infusion of the medicinal product should be immediately ceased, and the nuclear \nmedicine physician and the radiopharmacist should be promptly informed. Management should be in \naccordance with local protocols. \n\nUTumour lysis syndrome \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported following Lutetium (P177PLu) radioligand therapy. Patients with a \nhistory of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk and should be treated with \nincreased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be assessed at baseline and during \ntreatment. \n\n  \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies of lutetium (P177PLu) with other medicinal products have been performed. The possible \nuse of chelating therapies could interfere with the use of lutetium(P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal \nproducts refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the radiolabelled medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nUWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceutical to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has \nmissed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if \nthere are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of P177PLu -labelled medicinal products, \npregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test. \n \nUPregnancy \n \nThe use of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected  \npregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3). \n \nUBreast-feeding \n \nBefore administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given \nto the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breast-feeding, \nand to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity \nin breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding  should be interrupted and the \nexpressed feeds discarded. \n \nUFertility \n \nAccording to literature reports and taking a conservative approach (maximum patient dose of 10 GBq, \naverage labeling yield and no additional measures), it may be considered that P177PLu-labelled medicinal \nproducts do not lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic \ndamage in male testes or female ovaries. \n \nFurther information concerning the use of P177PLu-labelled medicinal products is specified in the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEffects on ability to drive or use machines following treatment by lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal \nproducts is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nUSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions following the intravenous administration of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products \nprepared by radiolabelling with Lumark will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. \nSuch information is supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled.  \nFor each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The \nactivity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable \nbearing in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary \ndefects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and \nmutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease \nitself.  \n \nUTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very common \n(≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), \nvery rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nAdverse drug reaction Frequency category \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nRefractory cytopenia with multilineage \ndysplasia (Myelodysplastic syndrome) (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nCommon \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (see section 4.4) Uncommon \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nAnaemia \n\nVery common Thrombocytopenia Leukopenia \nLymphopenia \nEndocrine disorders \nCarcinoid crisis Not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nTumour lysis syndrome Not known \nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea Very common Vomiting \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAlopecia Very common \n \nUDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDry mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving \nPSMA-targeted lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled radioligands and has been transient. \n \nAlopecia, described as mild and temporary, has been observed among patients receiving lutetium (P177PLu) \npeptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. \n \nUReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 30TUAppendix VU30T. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe presence of free lutetium (P177PLu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Lumark will \nlead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoetic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of an \ninadvertent administration of Lumark, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i.e. \nwithin 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca- EDTA in order to \nincrease the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Lumark for radiolabelling of \ncarrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: \n\n- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or \n- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) \n\n \nThese chelating agents help with the elimination of lutetium (P177PLu) radiotoxicity by an exchange between \nthe calcium ion in the complex and the lutetium (P177PLu) ion. Due to the capacity of the chelating \nligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound lutetium(P177PLu) are \nrapidly eliminated by the kidneys. \n \n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3-4 minutes or by \ninfusion (1 g in 100-250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection). \n \nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is \ncirculating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval >1 hour does \nnot preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous \nadministration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. \n \nIn any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions \nimmediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow. \n \nThe toxicity of the free lutetium (P177PLu) due to in vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body \nduring therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n  \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Not yet assigned, ATC code: Not yet assigned \n \nLutetium (P177PLu) chloride is produced by irradiation of P176PLu with neutrons. It decays by emission of beta \nradiation of  maximal 498 keV  to P177PHf-Hafnium. P177PLu-lutetium has a half-life of 6.647 days. \n \nThe pharmacodynamic properties of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith Lumark, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with Lumark \nin all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal product is likely to be \nineffective or unsafe in part or all of the paediatric population and on grounds that the specific medicinal \nproduct does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for the paediatric \npatients. This waiver does however not extend to any diagnostic or therapeutic uses of the medicinal product \nwhen linked to a carrier molecule (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith Lumark, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nDistribution \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPharmacokinetics of lutetium (P177PLu) was investigated in rats and mice. The distribution and mineral \nconcentrations in the organs were investigated at low (9-10 mg/kg) and high (19-20 mg/kg) doses \nadministered intravenously to rats. It appeared that more than 78% of the doses was distributed into liver, \nbone and spleen. For lutetium (P177PLu) the different dose levels did not result in significantly different uptake \nwith 65% appearing in the liver, 5.3% in the spleen and 13% in the bones at one day after administration.  \nWith respect to the distribution pattern in blood it appeared that 2 h after administration 15% of the lutetium \nas being present in blood, had entered the blood cells with the remaining 85% still being present in the \nserum. \n \nA more detailed study of the biodistribution of lutetium (P177PLu) chloride in mice confirms the relatively high \nuptake in the liver, kidneys and bone marrow The results indicated that lutetium (P177PLu) chloride is \naccumulated in the bone marrow and emphasizes the importance of all lutetium (P177PLu) to be peptide-bound \nat injection, as well as the in-vivo stability of the radionuclide-chelate-complex during therapy. \n \nPharmacokinetic data on Lumark related to free lutetium \n \nWhen the precursor is bound to a carrier molecule the content of radioactive free lutetium (P177PLu) is \nsupposed to be less than the stated amounts depending on the carrier used. Relevant data is included in the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of the labelled medicinal products. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological properties of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with \nLumark prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  \n \nNo animal toxicity studies were conducted with Lumark.  \n \nThe toxicity of lutetium (P177PLu) chloride has been studied in different mammals and using different \nadministration routes. Intraperitoneal administration resulted in generalised peritonitis with adhesion and \naccumulation of some ascetic fluid. By intraperitoneal route, the LD50 is approximately 300 mg/kg in mice \nand rats. By intravenous route, the LD50 in rats and mice ranges between 30 and 60 mg/kg. Intravenously \nadministrated doses resulted in varying effects on the blood pressure and a decreased heart rate. \nElectrocardiograms showed no irregularities in cardiac rhythm or conduction. Effects of the respiration were \nslight and variable. No gross differentiating changes were found of the tissues demonstrating no evidence of \nacute damage resulting from the experiment. The studies suggest that the intravenous toxicity of the ionic \ncompounds of the rare earth elements would decrease with atomic weight resulting in lutetium (P177PLu) being \nthe least toxic of the series.  \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHydrochloric acid \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with \nlutetium (P177PLu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. \n \nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles, etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal \nproduct are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe \nneedles (for example non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace \nmetal impurity levels. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal products \nother than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled.  \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n8 days from the date of ART (= end of production). \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from radiation. \nStorage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulations for radioactive materials. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container   \n \nThe radiopharmaceutical precursor solution is packaged in a colourless type I glass vial of 10 mL, closed \nwith a bromobutylrubber stopper and aluminium overseal. \nEach vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 to 5 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 8 to \n400 GBq at the ART. \n \nThe vials are placed in a lead container for protective shielding and packed in a plastic jar. \nEach pack contains one vial in a lead container. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nLumark is not intended for direct use in patients. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated \nclinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or \nappropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner, which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.   \n \nFor instruction on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.  \n \nIf at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this container is compromised it \nshould not be used.  \n \nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal \nproduct and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.  \n \nThe surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location and \nduring work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall \nradiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with patients \ninjected with lutetium (P177PLu)-radiopharmaceuticals. The use of television monitor systems to monitor the \npatients is recommended. Given the long half-life of lutetium (P177PLu) it is specially recommended to avoid \ninternal contamination. For this reason it is mandatory to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in \nany direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising radiation \nexposure resulting from repeated exposure, there is no specific recommendation except the strict observance \nof the above ones.  \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \nnational regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nLumark is for single use only. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation \nchamber. Lutetium (P177PLu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionization chamber \nare very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions \nwhich have been appropriately validated.  \n \nLumark isfor single use only \n \nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. \n \nThe vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The medicinal product should be \naseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single use needle and syringe after disinfection of \nthe stopper. \n \nAppropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, in order to maintain the sterility of Lumark and to maintain \nsterility throughout the labelling procedures.  \n \nThe complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with lutetium (P177PLu)-chloride. \nFree lutetium (P177PLu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in \nosteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration \nof lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with free lutetium (P177PLu), if present, \nleading to a rapid renal clearance of lutetium (P177PLu). \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n12 \n\n \n   \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX II \n \n\nA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nLumark 80 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor solution \nLutetium (P177PLu) chloride \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given the medicine combined with Lumark because it \n\ncontains important information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your  nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Lumark is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark is used  \n3. How to use the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Lumark   \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lumark is and what it is used for \n \nLumark is not a medicine and it is not intended to be used on its own.  \n \nLumark is a so-called radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the active substance \nlutetium (P177PLu) chloride.  \n \nLumark is used for radiolabelling medicines, a technique in which medicines are tagged (radiolabelled) with \na radioactive form of the element lutetium, known as lutetium (P177PLu). These medicines can then be used in \nmedical procedures to carry radioactivity to where it is needed in the body such as sites of tumour cells. \n \nLumark is only used to radiolabel medicines that have been specifically developed for use with the active \nsubstance lutetium (P177PLu) chloride. \n \nThe use of lutetium (P177PLu)-labelled medicines does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. \nYour doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain \nfrom the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation.  \n \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lumark. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark is used \n \nThe medicine radiolabelled with Lumark must not be used: \n- if you are allergic to lutetium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTreatment with medicine radiolabelled with lutetium (P177PLu) may lead to the following side effects \n• a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia) \n• a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop bleeding \n• a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are important \nfor protecting the body against infection \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nMost of these events are mild and only temporary. Because lutetium (P177PLu) can sometimes affect your blood \ncells, your doctor will do blood tests before you start and at regular intervals during treatment. \n \nDuring peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours, radiolabelled somatostatin \nanalogues are excreted by the kidneys. Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney \nfunction before you start and during treatment. \n\n \nTreatment with lutetium (P177PLu) may cause disturbances of liver function. Your doctor will take a blood test \nto monitor your liver function during treatment.  \n\nLumark-labelled medicines may be administered directly into your vein through a tube known as a cannula. \nThere have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue (extravasation). Tell your doctor if \nyou experience any swelling or pain in your arm. \n\nAfter neuroendocrine tumours are treated with lutetium (P177PLu), patients may experience symptoms \nassociated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as carcinoid crisis. Tell your doctor if you \nfeel faint or dizzy or experience flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment. \n \nTreatment with Lutetium (P177PLu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, due to the rapid breakdown of tumour \ncells. This may result in abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or seizures within a \nweek of treatment. Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if \nyou have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of breath. \n\n \nBefore administration of Lumark you should  \nDrink plenty of water before being given the radiolabelled medicine in order to urinate as often as possible \nduring the first few hours after the procedure. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lumark. \n \nOther medicines and medicines radiolabelled with Lumark \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nsince they may interfere with the procedure. \nIt is not known whether lutetium (P177PLu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies have \nnot been carried out. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \nnuclear  medicine doctor for advice before you are given medicines radiolabelled with Lumark. \n \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled with \nLumark if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-\nfeeding.  \n \nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor.  \n \nIf you are pregnant  \nMedicines radiolabelled with Lumark must not be administered if you are pregnant.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding  \nYou will be asked to stop breast-feeding if you are treated with medicines radiolabelled with Lumark.  \nPlease ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThe medicines used in combination with Lumark could affect your ability to drive and to use machines. \nPlease read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n \n3. How to use the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark  \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Medicines \nradiolabelled with Lumark will only be used in special, controlled areas. This product will only be handled \nand given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These people will take special care \nfor the safe use of this product and will keep you informed of their actions.  \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of medicine radiolabelled \nwith Lumark to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate \noutcome, depending on the co-administered medicine and its intended use.  \n \nAdministration of the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark and conduct of the procedure  \nLumark must be used only in combination with another medicine which has been specifically developed and \nauthorised for being combined with Lumark. It will only be administered as a combination. \n \nDuration of the procedure  \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure after the \nadministration of the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark.  \n \nAfter administration of the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark has been performed  \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the \nmedicine radiolabelled with Lumark. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n \nIf you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with Lumark than you should  \nSince the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark is handled by a nuclear medicine doctor under strictly \ncontrolled conditions, there is only a very small chance of possible overdose. However, in case of an \noverdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment.  \n \nShould you have any further question on the use of Lumark, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who \nsupervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark can cause side effects, although not everybody \ngets them.  \n \nDry mouth has been reported among patients with prostate cancer receiving treatment with Lutetium (P177PLu) \nand has been temporary. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n \n\n• Reduction in blood cell counts (platelets, red or white blood cells) \n• Nausea \n• Vomiting \n• Mild temporary hair loss \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n \n\n• Bone marrow cancer (myelodysplastic syndrome) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n \n\n• Bone marrow cancer (acute myeloid leukaemia) \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \n\n• Carcinoid crisis \n• Tumour lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of tumour cells) \n\n \nBone marrow cancer (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia) has been reported in patients \nseveral years after treatment with lutetium (P177PLu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine \ntumours.  \n\nAfter the medicine radiolabelled with Lumark is administered, it will deliver certain amounts of ionising \nradiation (radioactivity) which carries a small risk of cancer and development of hereditary defects. In all \ncases, the risk of the radiation is outweighed by the potential benefit of receiving the radiolabelled medicine. \n \nFor more information, refer to the package leaflet of the particular medicine to be radiolabelled. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your  nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How Lumark is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this radiopharmaceutical. Storing Lumark is the responsibility of the specialist \nand will be done in appropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with \nnational regulation on radioactive materials.  \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only. \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date and time which are stated on the label after EXP.  \n \nStore in the original package to protect from radiation. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Lumark contains  \n\n- The active substance is lutetium (P177PLu) chloride. Each mL of solution contains 80 GBq \nlutetium (P177PLu) chloride at activity reference time (ART), corresponding to a maximum of \n160 microgram of lutetium. The ART is defined as the end of production. (GBq: GigaBecquerel is the \nunit in which radioactivity is measured). \n\n- The other ingredients are hydrochloric acid and water for injections.  \n \nWhat Lumark looks like and contents of the pack \nLumark is presented as a sterile, clear, and colourless solution in a colourless type I glass vial of 10 mL, \nclosed with a bromobutylrubber stopper and aluminium overseal. \n \nEach vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 to 5 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 8 to \n400 GBq (at ART). The volume depends on the quantity of medicines combined with Lumark required for \nadministration by the nuclear medicine doctor. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n26 \n\nEach pack contains 1 glass vial in a lead cannister placed in a plastic jar. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nI.D.B.
