CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRenal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) \n\n \n\nVotubia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with \n\nTSC who are at risk of complications (based on factors such as tumour size or presence of aneurysm, \n\nor presence of multiple or bilateral tumours) but who do not require immediate surgery. \n\n \n\nThe evidence is based on analysis of change in sum of angiomyolipoma volume. \n\n \n\nSubependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC \n\n \n\nVotubia is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with SEGA associated with TSC \n\nwho require therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to surgery. \n\n \n\nThe evidence is based on analysis of change in SEGA volume. Further clinical benefit, such as \n\nimprovement in disease-related symptoms, has not been demonstrated. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Votubia should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients \n\nwith TSC and therapeutic drug monitoring. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRenal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC \n\nThe recommended dose is 10 mg of everolimus once daily. Treatment should continue as long as \n\nclinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nSEGA associated with TSC \n\nCareful titration may be required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Doses that will be tolerated \n\nand effective vary between patients. Concomitant antiepileptic therapy may affect the metabolism of \n\neverolimus and may contribute to this variance (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nDosing is individualised based on Body Surface Area (BSA) using the Dubois formula, where weight \n\n(W) is in kilograms and height (H) is in centimetres: \n\nBSA = (W0.425 x H0.725) x 0.007184 \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose for Votubia for the treatment of patients with SEGA is 4.5 mg/m2. A \n\nhigher starting dose of 7 mg/m2 is recommended for patients 1 to less than 3 years of age based on \n\npharmacokinetic simulations (see section 5.2). Different strengths of Votubia tablets can be combined \n\nto attain the desired dose. \n\n \n\nEverolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be assessed at least 1 week after commencing \n\ntreatment. Dosing should be titrated to attain trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/ml. The dose may be \n\nincreased to attain a higher trough concentration within the target range to obtain optimal efficacy, \n\nsubject to tolerability. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIndividualised dosing should be titrated by increasing the dose by increments of 2.5 mg to attain the \n\ntarget trough concentration for optimal clinical response. Efficacy, safety, concomitant therapy, and \n\nthe current trough concentration should be considered when planning for dose titration. Individualised \n\ndose titration can be based on simple proportion: \n\nNew everolimus dose = current dose x (target concentration / current concentration) \n\n \n\nFor example, a patient’s current dose based on BSA is 2.5 mg with a steady state concentration of \n\n4 ng/ml. In order to achieve a target concentration above the lower Cmin limit of 5 ng/ml, e.g. 8 ng/ml, \n\nthe new everolimus dose would be 5 mg (an increase of 2.5 mg from the current daily dose). In cases \n\nwhere the revised dose is not a multiple of 2.5 mg, it should be rounded to the next available tablet \n\nstrength. \n\n \n\nDosing recommendations for paediatric patients with SEGA are consistent with those for the adult \n\nSEGA population, except for patients in the range from 1 year to less than 3 years of age, and those \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see section “Hepatic impairment” below and section 5.2). \n\n \n\nSEGA volume should be evaluated approximately 3 months after commencing Votubia therapy, with \n\nsubsequent dose adjustments taking changes in SEGA volume, corresponding trough concentration, \n\nand tolerability into consideration. \n\n \n\nOnce a stable dose is attained, trough concentrations should be monitored every 3 to 6 months in \n\npatients with changing BSA, or every 6 to 12 months in patients with stable BSA, for the duration of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments due to adverse reactions \n\nManagement of severe and/or intolerable suspected adverse reactions may require dose reduction \n\nand/or temporary interruption of Votubia therapy. For adverse reactions of Grade 1, dose adjustment is \n\nusually not required. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose is approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the daily dose previously administered. For dose reductions below the lowest available strength, \n\nalternate day dosing should be considered. \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises dose adjustment recommendations for specific adverse reactions (see also \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Votubia dose adjustment recommendations \n\n \n\nAdverse reaction Severity1 Votubia dose adjustment \n\nNon-infectious \n\npneumonitis \n\nGrade 2 Consider interruption of therapy until symptoms improve to \n\nGrade 1. \n\nRe-initiate Votubia at approximately 50% lower than the \n\ndaily dose previously administered. \n\nDiscontinue treatment if failure to recover within 4 weeks. \n\n Grade 3 Interrupt Votubia until symptoms resolve to Grade 1. \n\nConsider re-initiating Votubia at approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the daily dose previously administered.

Trough concentrations should be assessed at least 1 week after the \n\ninitial dose, after any change in dose or pharmaceutical form, after initiation of or change in \n\nco-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) or after any change in hepatic status \n\n(Child-Pugh) (see section “Hepatic impairment” below and section 5.2). Trough concentrations should \n\nbe assessed 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of or change in co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5) since the natural degradation time of the induced enzymes has to be taken into \n\naccount. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus blood concentrations, using a validated assay, is an option \n\nto be considered for patients treated for renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC (see section 5.1) \n\nafter initiation of or change in co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 4.5) or after any change in hepatic status (Child-Pugh) (see section “Hepatic impairment” below \n\nand section 5.2). \n\n \n\nWhen possible, the same assay and laboratory for therapeutic drug monitoring should be used \n\nthroughout the treatment. \n\n \n\nSwitching pharmaceutical forms \n\nVotubia is available in two pharmaceutical forms: tablets and dispersible tablets. Votubia tablets and \n\nVotubia dispersible tablets are not to be used interchangeably. The two pharmaceutical forms must not \n\nbe combined to achieve the desired dose. The same pharmaceutical form must be used consistently, as \n\nappropriate for the indication being treated. \n\n \n\nWhen switching pharmaceutical forms, the dose should be adjusted to the closest milligram strength of \n\nthe new pharmaceutical form and the everolimus trough concentration should be assessed at least \n\n1 week later (see section “Therapeutic drug monitoring” above). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC: \n\n Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A): The recommended dose is 7.5 mg daily. \n\n Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B): The recommended dose is 5 mg daily. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): Votubia is only recommended if the desired benefit \noutweighs the risk. In this case, a dose of 2.5 mg daily must not be exceeded (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). \n\nDose adjustments should be made if a patient’s hepatic (Child-Pugh) status changes during treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients with SEGA associated with TSC: \n\nPatients <18 years of age: \n\nVotubia is not recommended for patients <18 years of age with SEGA and hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPatients ≥18 years of age: \n\n Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A): 75% of the recommended starting dose calculated \nbased on BSA (rounded to the nearest strength) \n\n Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B): 50% of the recommended starting dose \ncalculated based on BSA (rounded to the nearest strength) \n\n Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): Votubia is only recommended if the desired benefit \noutweighs the risk. In this case, 25% of the dose calculated based on BSA (rounded to the \n\nnearest strength) must not be exceeded. \n\nEverolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be assessed at least 1 week after any change in \n\nhepatic status (Child-Pugh). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Votubia in children aged 0 to 18 years with renal angiomyolipoma \n\nassociated with TSC in the absence of SEGA have not been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of Votubia in children below the age of 1 year with \n\nTSC who have SEGA have not been established. No data are available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nClinical study results did not show an impact of Votubia on growth and pubertal development. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nVotubia must be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, consistently either with or \n\nwithout food (see section 5.2). Votubia tablets are to be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The \n\ntablets must not be chewed or crushed. For patients with TSC who have SEGA and are unable to \n\nswallow tablets, Votubia tablet(s) can be dispersed completely in a glass with approximately 30 ml of \n\nwater by gently stirring until the tablet(s) is(are) fully disintegrated (approximately 7 minutes), \n\nimmediately prior to drinking. After the dispersion has been swallowed, any residue must be \n\nre-dispersed in the same volume of water and swallowed (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis \n\n \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) was described very commonly in \n\npatients taking everolimus in the advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) setting (see section 4.8). Some \n\ncases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed. A diagnosis of non-infectious \n\npneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and \n\nsymptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough or dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic \n\nand other non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. \n\nOpportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) should be \n\nruled out in the differential diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis (see section “Infections” below). \n\nPatients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. \n\n \n\nPatients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or \n\nno symptoms may continue Votubia therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms are moderate, \n\nconsideration should be given to interruption of therapy until symptoms improve. The use of \n\ncorticosteroids may be indicated. Votubia may be reinitiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the dose previously administered. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFor cases where symptoms of non-infectious pneumonitis are severe, Votubia therapy should be \n\ndiscontinued and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Votubia \n\nmay be reinitiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered \n\ndepending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n\n \n\nFor patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, \n\nprophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) may be considered. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nEverolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral \n\nor protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens (see section 4.8). Localised \n\nand systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections \n\nsuch as aspergillosis, candidiasis or pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) and viral \n\ninfections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking \n\neverolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to sepsis [including septic shock], \n\nrespiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally fatal in adult and paediatric patients (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPhysicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Votubia. Pre-existing \n\ninfections should be treated appropriately and should have resolved fully before starting treatment \n\nwith Votubia. While taking Votubia, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of \n\ninfection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation \n\nof Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, Votubia treatment should be promptly and \n\npermanently discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate antifungal therapy. \n\n \n\nCases of pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP), some with fatal outcome, have been \n\nreported in patients who received everolimus. PJP/PCP may be associated with concomitant use of \n\ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis for PJP/PCP should be considered \n\nwhen concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, \n\ndyspnoea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without \n\nrespiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n\n \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nStomatitis \n\n \n\nStomatitis, including mouth ulcerations and oral mucositis, is the most commonly reported adverse \n\nreaction in patients treated with Votubia (see section 4.8). Stomatitis mostly occurs within the first \n\n8 weeks of treatment. A single-arm study in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with \n\nAfinitor (everolimus) plus exemestane suggested that an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution, \n\nadministered as a mouthwash during the initial 8 weeks of treatment, may decrease the incidence and \n\nseverity of stomatitis (see section 5.1). Management of stomatitis may therefore include prophylactic \n\n(in adults) and/or therapeutic use of topical treatments, such as an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral \n\nsolution as a mouthwash. However products containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and thyme \n\nderivatives should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Monitoring for and treatment of \n\nfungal infection is recommended, especially in patients being treated with steroid-based medicinal \n\n\n\n9 \n\nproducts. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nSerious cases of haemorrhage, some with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with \n\neverolimus in the oncology setting. No serious cases of renal haemorrhage were reported in the TSC \n\nsetting. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients taking Votubia, particularly during concomitant use with active \n\nsubstances known to affect platelet function or that can increase the risk of haemorrhage as well as in \n\npatients with a history of bleeding disorders. Healthcare professionals and patients should be vigilant \n\nfor signs and symptoms of bleeding throughout the treatment period, especially if risk factors for \n\nhaemorrhage are combined. \n\n \n\nRenal failure events \n\n \n\nCases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in \n\npatients treated with Votubia (see section 4.8). Renal function of patients should be monitored \n\nparticularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function. \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests and monitoring \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\nElevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea \n\nnitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of Votubia \n\ntherapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nBlood glucose \n\nHyperglycaemia has been reported in patients taking Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of fasting \n\nserum glucose is recommended prior to the start of Votubia therapy and periodically thereafter. More \n\nfrequent monitoring is recommended when Votubia is co-administered with other medicinal products \n\nthat may induce hyperglycaemia. When possible optimal glycaemic control should be achieved before \n\nstarting a patient on Votubia. \n\n \n\nBlood lipids \n\nDyslipidaemia (including hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) has been reported in \n\npatients taking Votubia. Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of Votubia \n\ntherapy and periodically thereafter, as well as management with appropriate medical therapy, is also \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nHaematological parameters \n\nDecreased haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start \n\nof Votubia therapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nCo-administration with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or the multidrug efflux pump \n\nP-glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. If co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP \n\ninhibitor or inducer cannot be avoided, dose adjustments of Votubia may be required (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors result in dramatically increased blood \n\nconcentrations of everolimus (see section 4.5). There are currently not sufficient data to allow dosing \n\nrecommendations in this situation. Hence, concomitant treatment of Votubia and potent inhibitors is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when Votubia is taken in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic index due to the potential for drug interactions. If Votubia is \n\ntaken with orally administered CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. pimozide, \n\nterfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, quinidine, ergot alkaloid derivatives or carbamazepine), the patient \n\nshould be monitored for undesirable effects described in the product information of the orally \n\nadministered CYP3A4 substrate (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nVotubia is not recommended for use in patients: \n\n ≥18 years of age and concomitant severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) unless the \npotential benefit outweighs the risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n <18 years of age with SEGA and concomitant hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B and C) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nThe use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Votubia (see section 4.5). For \n\npaediatric patients with SEGA who do not require immediate treatment, completion of the \n\nrecommended childhood series of live virus vaccinations is advised prior to the start of therapy \n\naccording to local treatment guidelines. \n\n \n\nWound healing complications \n\n \n\nImpaired wound healing is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including Votubia. Caution should \n\ntherefore be exercised with the use of Votubia in the peri-surgical period. \n\n \n\nLactose \n\n \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. Therefore, \n\nabsorption and subsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by products that affect \n\nCYP3A4 and/or PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor \n\nof CYP2D6. \n\n \n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and PgP are \n\nlisted in Table 2 below. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors increasing everolimus concentrations \n\n \n\nSubstances that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may increase everolimus blood concentrations by \n\ndecreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inducers decreasing everolimus concentrations \n\n \n\nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP may decrease everolimus blood concentrations by \n\nincreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 2 Effects of other active substances on everolimus \n\n \n\nActive substance by \n\ninteraction \n\n \n\nInteraction – Change in \n\nEverolimus AUC/Cmax \n\nGeometric mean ratio \n\n(observed range) \n\nRecommendations concerning \n\nco-administration \n\nPotent CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors \n\nKetoconazole AUC ↑15.3-fold \n\n(range 11.2-22.5) \n\nCmax ↑4.1-fold \n\n(range 2.6-7.0) \n\nConcomitant treatment of Votubia \n\nand potent inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended. \n\nItraconazole, \n\nposaconazole, \n\nvoriconazole \n\nNot studied.

Due to \n\nbetween subject variability the \n\nrecommended dose adjustments may \n\nnot be optimal in all individuals, \n\ntherefore close monitoring of side \n\neffects is recommended. If the \n\nmoderate inhibitor is discontinued, \n\nconsider a washout period of at least \n\n2 to 3 days (average elimination time \n\nfor most commonly used moderate \n\ninhibitors) before the Votubia dose is \n\nreturned to the dose used prior to \n\ninitiation of the co-administration \n\n(see also Therapeutic drug \n\nmonitoring in section 4.2). \n\n \n\nFor patients with SEGA associated \n\nwith TSC: \n\nIf patients require co-administration \n\nof a moderate CYP3A4 or PgP \n\ninhibitor, reduce the daily dose by \n\napproximately 50%.

Everolimus trough \n\nconcentrations should be assessed at \n\nleast 1 week after the addition of a \n\nmoderate CYP3A4 or PgP inhibitor. \n\nIf the moderate inhibitor is \n\ndiscontinued, consider a washout \n\nperiod of at least 2 to 3 days \n\n(average elimination time for most \n\ncommonly used moderate inhibitors) \n\nbefore the Votubia dose is returned \n\nto the dose used prior to initiation of \n\nthe co-administration. The \n\neverolimus trough concentration \n\nshould be assessed at least 1 week \n\nlater (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nGrapefruit juice or \n\nother food affecting \n\nCYP3A4/PgP \n\nNot studied. Increased exposure \n\nexpected (the effect varies \n\nwidely). \n\nCombination should be avoided. \n\nPotent and moderate CYP3A4 inducers \n\nRifampicin AUC ↓63% \n\n(range 0-80%) \n\nCmax ↓58% \n\n(range 10-70%) \n\nAvoid the use of concomitant potent \n\nCYP3A4 inducers. \n\n \n\nFor patients with renal \n\nangiomyolipoma associated with \n\nTSC: \n\nIf patients require co-administration \n\nof a potent CYP3A4 inducer, a \n\nVotubia dose increase from 10 mg \n\ndaily up to 20 mg daily should be \n\nconsidered using 5 mg increments or \n\nless applied on Day 4 and 8 \n\nfollowing start of the inducer. This \n\ndose of Votubia is predicted to adjust \n\nthe AUC to the range observed \n\nwithout inducers. However, there are \n\nno clinical data with this dose \n\nadjustment. If treatment with the \n\ninducer is discontinued, consider a \n\nwashout period of at least 3 to 5 days \n\n(reasonable time for significant \n\nenzyme de-induction) before the \n\nVotubia dose is returned to the dose \n\nused prior to initiation of the \n\nco-administration (see also \n\nTherapeutic drug monitoring in \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nFor patients with SEGA associated \n\nwith TSC: \n\nPatients receiving concomitant \n\npotent CYP3A4 inducers may \n\nrequire an increased Votubia dose to \n\nachieve the same exposure as \n\npatients not taking potent inducers. \n\nDosing should be titrated to attain \n\ntrough concentrations of 5 to \n\n15 ng/ml. If concentrations are \n\nDexamethasone Not studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\nAntiepileptics (e.g. \n\ncarbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin) \n\nNot studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\nEfavirenz, nevirapine Not studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nbelow 5 ng/ml, the daily dose may \n\nbe increased by 2.5 mg every \n\n2 weeks, checking the trough level \n\nand assessing tolerability before \n\nincreasing the dose. \n\n \n\nThe addition of another concomitant \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducer may not \n\nrequire additional dose adjustment. \n\nAssess the everolimus trough level \n\n2 weeks after initiating the additional \n\ninducer. Adjust the dose by \n\nincrements of 2.5 mg as necessary to \n\nmaintain the target trough \n\nconcentration. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of one of multiple \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducers may not \n\nrequire additional dose adjustment. \n\nAssess the everolimus trough level \n\n2 weeks after discontinuation of one \n\nof multiple strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. If all potent inducers are \n\ndiscontinued, consider a washout \n\nperiod of at least 3 to 5 days \n\n(reasonable time for significant \n\nenzyme de-induction) before the \n\nVotubia dose is returned to the dose \n\nused prior to initiation of the \n\nco-administration. The everolimus \n\ntrough concentrations should be \n\nassessed 2 to 4 weeks later since the \n\nnatural degradation time of the \n\ninduced enzymes has to be taken into \n\naccount (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nSt John’s Wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum) \n\nNot studied. Large decrease in \n\nexposure expected. \n\nPreparations containing St John’s \n\nWort should not be used during \n\ntreatment with everolimus \n\n \n\nAgents whose plasma concentration may be altered by everolimus \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro results, the systemic concentrations obtained after oral daily doses of 10 mg make \n\ninhibition of PgP, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 unlikely. However, inhibition of CYP3A4 and PgP in the \n\ngut cannot be excluded. An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration \n\nof an oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% \n\nincrease in midazolam Cmax and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC(0-inf). The effect is likely to be due \n\nto inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by everolimus. Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of \n\norally co-administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of \n\nsystemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn EXIST-3 (Study CRAD001M2304), everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the \n\nantiepileptics carbamazepine, clobazam, and the clobazam metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about \n\n10%. The increase in the pre-dose concentrations of these antiepileptics may not be clinically \n\nsignificant but dose adjustments for antiepileptics with a narrow therapeutic index, e.g carbamazepine, \n\nmay be considered. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of antiepileptics that are \n\nsubstrates of CYP3A4 (clonazepam, diazepam, felbamate and zonisamide). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors \n\n \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nThe immune response to vaccination may be affected and, therefore, vaccination may be less effective \n\nduring treatment with Votubia. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with \n\nVotubia. Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, \n\nBCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, \n\ninjected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based \n\ncontraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device \n\n[IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after \n\nending treatment. \n\n \n\nMale patients should not be prohibited from attempting to father children. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The \n\npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nEverolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus \n\nand/or its metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus \n\nshould not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however \n\nsecondary amenorrhoea and associated luteinising hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) \n\nimbalance has been observed in female patients (see also section 5.3 for preclinical observations on \n\nthe male and female reproductive systems). Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility \n\nmay be compromised by treatment with everolimus (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nVotubia has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \n\nadvised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue during treatment \n\nwith Votubia. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThree randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies, including double-blind \n\nand open label treatment periods, and a non-randomised, open-label, single-arm phase II study \n\ncontribute to the safety profile of Votubia (n=612, including 409 patients <18 years of age; median \n\nduration of exposure 36.8 months [range 0.5 to 83.2]). \n\n EXIST-3 (CRAD001M2304): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial \ncomparing adjunctive treatment of low and high everolimus exposure (low trough [LT] range of \n\n3-7 ng/ml [n=117] and high trough [HT] range of 9-15 ng/ml [n=130]) versus placebo (n=119), \n\nin patients with TSC and refractory partial-onset seizures receiving 1 to 3 antiepileptics. The \n\nmedian duration of the double-blind period was 18 weeks. The cumulative median duration \n\nexposure to Votubia (361 patients who took at least one dose of everolimus) was 30.4 months \n\n(range 0.5 to 48.8). \n\n EXIST-2 (CRAD001M2302): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial of \neverolimus (n=79) versus placebo (n=39) in patients with either TSC plus renal \n\nangiomyolipoma (n=113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) plus renal \n\nangiomyolipoma (n=5). The median duration of blinded study treatment was 48.1 weeks (range \n\n2 to 115) for patients receiving Votubia and 45.0 weeks (range 9 to 115) for those receiving \n\nplacebo. The cumulative median duration of exposure to Votubia (112 patients who took at least \n\none dose of everolimus) was 46.9 months (range 0.5 to 63.9). \n\n EXIST-1 (CRAD001M2301): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial of \neverolimus (n=78) versus placebo (n=39) in patients with TSC who have SEGA, irrespective of \n\nage. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 52.2 weeks (range 24 to 89) for \n\npatients receiving Votubia and 46.6 weeks (range 14 to 88) for those receiving placebo. The \n\ncumulative median duration of exposure to Votubia (111 patients who took at least one dose of \n\neverolimus) was 47.1 months (range 1.9 to 58.3). \n\n CRAD001C2485: This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm phase II study of everolimus \nin patients with SEGA (n=28). The median duration of exposure was 67.8 months (range 4.7 to \n\n83.2). \n\n \n\nThe adverse events considered to be associated with the use of Votubia (adverse reactions), based \n\nupon the review and medical assessment of all adverse events reported in the above studies, are \n\ndescribed below. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/10) from the pooled safety data are (in decreasing \n\norder): stomatitis, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, \n\ncough, rash, headache, amenorrhoea, acne, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sinusitis, menstruation \n\nirregular, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, fatigue, hypercholesterolaemia, and hypertension. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) were pneumonia, stomatitis, \n\namenorrhoea, neutropenia, pyrexia, menstruation irregular, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea, and \n\ncellulitis. The grades follow CTCAE Version 3.0 and 4.03. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 3 shows the incidence of adverse reactions based on pooled data of patients receiving \n\neverolimus in the three TSC studies (including both the double-blind and open-label extension phase, \n\nwhere applicable). Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Reactivation of infection is an expected reaction during periods of \n\nimmunosuppression. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with renal \n\nfailure events (including fatal outcome), proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. Monitoring of \n\nrenal function is recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, everolimus has been associated with haemorrhage events. On rare occasions, fatal \n\noutcomes were observed in the oncology setting (see section 4.4). No serious cases of renal \n\nhaemorrhage were reported in the TSC setting. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases \n\nof pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP), some with fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n \n\nAdditional adverse reactions of relevance observed in oncology clinical studies and post-marketing \n\nspontaneous reports, were cardiac failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, impaired \n\nwound healing and hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, angioedema has been reported with and \n\nwithout concomitant use of ACE inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal phase II study, 22 of the 28 SEGA patients studied were below the age of 18 years and \n\nin the pivotal phase III study, 101 of the 117 SEGA patients studied were below the age of 18 years. In \n\nthe pivotal phase III study in patients with TSC and refractory seizures, 299 of the 366 patients studied \n\nwere below the age of 18 years. The overall type, frequency and severity of adverse reactions observed \n\nin children and adolescents have been generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the \n\nexception of infections which were reported at a higher frequency and severity in children below the \n\nage of 6 years. A total of 49 out of 137 patients (36%) aged <6 years had Grade 3/4 infections, \n\ncompared to 53 out of 272 patients (19%) aged 6 to <18 years and 27 out of 203 patients (13%) aged \n\n≥18 years. Two fatal cases due to infection were reported in 409 patients aged <18 years receiving \n\neverolimus. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nIn the oncology safety pooling, 37% of the patients treated with everolimus were ≥65 years of age. \n\nThe number of oncology patients with an adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of everolimus \n\nwas higher in patients ≥65 years of age (20% versus 13%). The most common adverse reactions \n\nleading to discontinuation were pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease), fatigue, dyspnoea, \n\nand stomatitis. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nReported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 70 mg have been \n\ngiven with acceptable acute tolerability in the adult population. \n\n \n\nIt is essential to assess everolimus blood levels in cases of suspected overdose. General supportive \n\nmeasures should be initiated in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialysable to any \n\nrelevant degree (less than 10% was removed within 6 hours of haemodialysis). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA limited number of paediatric patients have been exposed to doses higher than 10 mg/m2/day. No \n\nsigns of acute toxicity have been reported in these cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, protein kinase \n\ninhibitors, ATC code: L01XE10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nEverolimus is a selective mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR is a key \n\nserine-threonine kinase, the activity of which is known to be upregulated in a number of human \n\ncancers. Everolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12, forming a complex that inhibits \n\nmTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity. Inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway interferes with \n\nthe translation and synthesis of proteins by reducing the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase \n\n(S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP-1) that regulate proteins involved \n\nin the cell cycle, angiogenesis and glycolysis. Everolimus can reduce levels of vascular endothelial \n\ngrowth factor (VEGF). In patients with TSC, treatment with everolimus increases VEGF-A and \n\ndecreases VEGF-D levels. Everolimus is a potent inhibitor of the growth and proliferation of tumour \n\ncells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and blood-vessel-associated smooth muscle cells and has been \n\nshown to reduce glycolysis in solid tumours in vitro and in vivo. \n\n \n\nTwo primary regulators of mTORC1 signalling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis \n\ncomplexes 1 & 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to elevated rheb-GTP levels, a \n\nras family GTPase, which interacts with the mTORC1 complex to cause its activation. mTORC1 \n\nactivation leads to a downstream kinase signalling cascade, including activation of the S6 kinases. In \n\nTSC syndrome, inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation \n\nthroughout the body. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nRenal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC \n\nEXIST-2 (study CRAD001M2302), a randomised, controlled phase III study was conducted to \n\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of Votubia in patients with TSC plus renal angiomyolipoma. Presence \n\nof at least one angiomyolipoma ≥3 cm in longest diameter using CT/MRI (based on local radiology \n\nassessment) was required for entry. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central \n\nradiology review. The analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptics at \n\nrandomisation (yes/no). \n\n \n\nKey secondary endpoints included time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nA total of 118 patients were randomised, 79 to Votubia 10 mg daily and 39 to placebo. Median age \n\nwas 31 years (range: 18 to 61 years; 46.6% were <30 years at enrolment), 33.9% were male, and \n\n89.0% were Caucasian. Of the enrolled patients, 83.1% had angiomyolipomas ≥4 cm (28.8% ≥8 cm), \n\n78.0% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 39.0% had undergone prior renal \n\nembolisation/nephrectomy; 96.6% had skin lesions at baseline and 44.1% had target SEGAs (at least \n\none SEGA ≥1 cm in longest diameter). \n\n \n\nResults showed that the primary objective related to best overall angiomyolipoma response was met \n\nwith best overall response rates of 41.8% (95% CI: 30.8, 53.4) for the Votubia arm compared with 0% \n\n(95% CI: 0.0, 9.0) for the placebo arm (p<0.0001) (Table 4). \n\n \n\nPatients initially treated with placebo were allowed to cross over to everolimus at the time of \n\nangiomyolipoma progression and upon recognition that treatment with everolimus was superior to \n\ntreatment with placebo. At the time of the final analysis (4 years following the last patient \n\nrandomisation), the median duration of exposure to everolimus was 204.1 weeks (range 2 to 278). The \n\nangiomyolipoma best overall response rate had increased to 58.0% (95% CI: 48.3, 67.3), with a rate of \n\nstable disease of 30.4% (Table 4). \n\n \n\nAmong patients treated with everolimus during the study, no cases of angiomyolipoma-related \n\nnephrectomy and only one case of renal embolisation were reported. \n\n \n\nTable 4 EXIST-2 - Angiomyolipoma response \n\n \n\n Primary analysis3 Final \n\nanalysis4 \n\n Votubia Placebo p-value Votubia \n\n n=79 n=39  n=112 \n\nPrimary analysis  \n\n Angiomyolipoma response rate1,2 – % 41.8 0 <0.0001 58.0 \n\n 95% CI 30.8, 53.4 0.0, 9.0  48.3, 67.3 \n\nBest overall angiomyolipoma response – %  \n\n Response 41.8 0  58.0 \n\n Stable disease 40.5 79.5  30.4 \n\n Progression 1.3 5.1  0.9 \n\n Not evaluable 16.5 15.4  10.7 \n1 According to independent central radiology review \n2 Angiomyolipoma responses were confirmed with a repeat scan.

At weeks 12, 96 and 192, ≥ 30% reductions in volume were observed in 75.0%, 80.6%, and \n\n85.2% of the treated patients, respectively. Similarly, at the same timepoints, ≥50% reductions in \n\nvolume were observed in 44.2%, 63.3%, and 68.9% of the treated patients, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nMedian time to angiomyolipoma progression was 11.4 months in the placebo arm and was not reached \n\nin the everolimus arm (HR 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.37; p<0.0001). Progressions were observed in 3.8% \n\nof patients in the everolimus arm compared with 20.5% in the placebo arm. Estimated progression-free \n\nrates at 6 months were 98.4% for the everolimus arm and 83.4% for the placebo arm. At the final \n\nanalysis, median time to angiomyolipoma progression was not reached. Angiomyolipoma progressions \n\nwere observed in 14.3% of the patients. The estimated angiomyolipoma progression-free rates at \n\n24 months and 48 months were 91.6% and 83.1%, respectively. \n\n \n\nAt the primary analysis, skin lesion response rates of 26.0% (95% CI: 16.6, 37.2) for the Votubia arm \n\nand 0% (95% CI: 0.0, 9.5) for the placebo arm were observed (p=0.0002). At the final analysis, the \n\nskin lesion response rate had increased to 68.2% (95% CI: 58.5, 76.9), with one patient reporting a \n\nconfirmed complete clinical skin lesion response and no patients experiencing progressive disease as \n\ntheir best response. \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory analysis of patients with TSC with angiomyolipoma who also had SEGA, the SEGA \n\nresponse rate (proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in target lesion volumes in \n\nthe absence of progression) was 10.3% in the everolimus arm in the primary analysis (versus no \n\nresponses reported in the 13 patients randomised to placebo with a SEGA lesion at baseline) and \n\nincreased to 48.0% in the final analysis. \n\n \n\nPost-hoc sub-group analysis of EXIST-2 (study CRAD001M2302) carried out at time of primary \n\nanalysis demonstrated that angiomyolipoma response rate is reduced below the threshold of 5 ng/ml \n\n(Table 5). \n\n \n\nTable 5 EXIST-2 - Angiomyolipoma response rates by time-averaged Cmin category, at \n\nprimary analysis \n\n \n\nTime-averaged Cmin \n\ncategory \n\nNumber of \n\npatients \n\nResponse rate 95% confidence interval \n\n≤5 ng/ml 20 0.300 0.099, 0.501 \n\n>5 ng/ml 42 0.524 0.373, 0.675 \n\nDifference1  -0.224 -0.475, 0.027 \n1 Difference is “≤5 ng/ml” minus “>5 ng/ml” \n\n \n\nSEGA associated with TSC \n\nPhase III study in SEGA patients \n\nEXIST-1 (Study CRAD001M2301), a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase III study of \n\nVotubia versus placebo, was conducted in patients with SEGA, irrespective of age. Patients were \n\nrandomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Votubia or matching placebo. Presence of at least one \n\nSEGA lesion ≥1.0 cm in longest diameter using MRI (based on local radiology assessment) was \n\nrequired for entry. In addition, serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, presence of a new SEGA \n\nlesion ≥1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus was required for entry. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology \n\nreview. The analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptics at randomisation \n\n(yes/no). \n\n \n\nKey secondary endpoints in hierarchal order of testing included the absolute change in frequency of \n\ntotal seizure events per 24-hour EEG from baseline to week 24, time to SEGA progression, and skin \n\nlesion response rate. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nA total of 117 patients were randomised, 78 to Votubia and 39 to placebo. The two treatment arms \n\nwere generally well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics and \n\nhistory of prior anti-SEGA therapies. In the total population, 57.3% of patients were male and 93.2% \n\nwere Caucasian. The median age for the total population was 9.5 years (age range for the Votubia arm: \n\n1.0 to 23.9; age range for the placebo arm: 0.8 to 26.6), 69.2% of the patients were aged 3 to <18 years \n\nand 17.1% were <3 years at enrolment. \n\n \n\nOf the enrolled patients, 79.5% had bilateral SEGAs, 42.7% had ≥2 target SEGA lesions, 25.6% had \n\ninferior growth, 9.4% had evidence of deep parenchymal invasion, 6.8% had radiographic evidence of \n\nhydrocephalus, and 6.8% had undergone prior SEGA-related surgery. 94.0% had skin lesions at \n\nbaseline and 37.6% had target renal angiomyolipoma lesions (at least one angiomyolipoma ≥1 cm in \n\nlongest diameter). \n\n \n\nThe median duration of blinded study treatment was 9.6 months (range: 5.5 to 18.1) for patients \n\nreceiving Votubia and 8.3 months (range: 3.2 to 18.3) for those receiving placebo. \n\n \n\nResults showed that Votubia was superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of best overall SEGA \n\nresponse (p<0.0001). Response rates were 34.6% (95% CI: 24.2, 46.2) for the Votubia arm compared \n\nwith 0% (95% CI: 0.0, 9.0) for the placebo arm (Table 6). In addition, all 8 patients on the Votubia \n\narm who had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus at baseline had a decrease in ventricular volume. \n\n \n\nPatients initially treated with placebo were allowed to cross over to everolimus at the time of SEGA \n\nprogression and upon recognition that treatment with everolimus was superior to treatment with \n\nplacebo. All patients receiving at least one dose of everolimus were followed until medicinal product \n\ndiscontinuation or study completion. At the time of the final analysis, the median duration of exposure \n\namong all such patients was 204.9 weeks (range: 8.1 to 253.7). The best overall SEGA response rate \n\nhad increased to 57.7% (95% CI: 47.9, 67.0) at the final analysis. \n\n \n\nNo patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the entire course of the study. \n\n \n\nTable 6 EXIST-1 – SEGA response \n\n \n\n Primary analysis3  Final analysis4 \n\n Votubia Placebo p-value Votubia \n\n N=78 N=39  N=111 \n\n SEGA response rate1,2 - (%) 34.6 0 <0.0001 57.7 \n\n 95% CI 24.2, 46.2 0.0, 9.0  47.9, 67.0 \n\nBest overall SEGA response - (%)     \n\n Response 34.6 0  57.7 \n\n Stable disease 62.8 92.3  39.6 \n\n Progression 0 7.7  0 \n\n Not evaluable 2.6 0  2.7 \n1 according to independent central radiology review \n2 SEGA responses were confirmed with a repeat scan.

Sustained reductions were evident at week 24, 41.9% (31/74) of patients \n\nhad ≥50% reductions and 78.4% (58/74) of patients had ≥30% reductions in SEGA volume. \n\n \n\nIn the everolimus treated population (N=111) of the study, including patients who crossed over from \n\nthe placebo group, tumour response, starting as early as after 12 weeks on everolimus, was sustained \n\nat later time points. The proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reductions in SEGA volume was \n\n45.9% (45/98) and 62.1% (41/66) at weeks 96 and 192 after start of everolimus treatment. Similarly, \n\nthe proportion of patients achieving at least 30% reductions in SEGA volume was 71.4% (70/98) and \n\n77.3% (51/66) at weeks 96 and 192 after start of everolimus treatment. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the first key secondary endpoint, change in seizure frequency, was inconclusive; thus, \n\ndespite the fact that positive results were observed for the two subsequent secondary endpoints (time \n\nto SEGA progression and skin lesion response rate), they could not be declared formally statistically \n\nsignificant. \n\n \n\nMedian time to SEGA progression based on central radiology review was not reached in either \n\ntreatment arm. Progressions were only observed in the placebo arm (15.4%; p=0.0002). Estimated \n\nprogression-free rates at 6 months were 100% for the Votubia arm and 85.7% for the placebo arm. The \n\nlong-term follow-up of patients randomised to everolimus and patients randomised to placebo who \n\nthereafter crossed over to everolimus demonstrated durable responses. \n\n \n\nAt the time of the primary analysis, Votubia demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in skin \n\nlesion response (p=0.0004), with response rates of 41.7% (95% CI: 30.2, 53.9) for the Votubia arm \n\nand 10.5% (95% CI: 2.9, 24.8) for the placebo arm. At the final analysis, the skin lesion response rate \n\nincreased to 58.1% (95% CI: 48.1, 67.7). \n\n \n\nPhase II study in patients with SEGA \n\nA prospective, open-label, single-arm phase II study (Study CRAD001C2485) was conducted to \n\nevaluate the safety and efficacy of Votubia in patients with SEGA. Radiological evidence of serial \n\nSEGA growth was required for entry. \n\n \n\nChange in SEGA volume during the core 6-month treatment phase, as assessed via an independent \n\ncentral radiology review, was the primary efficacy endpoint. After the core treatment phase, patients \n\ncould be enrolled into an extension phase where SEGA volume was assessed every 6 months. \n\n \n\nIn total, 28 patients received treatment with Votubia; median age was 11 years (range 3 to 34), 61% \n\nmale, 86% Caucasian. Thirteen patients (46%) had a secondary smaller SEGA, including 12 in the \n\ncontralateral ventricle. \n\n \n\nPrimary SEGA volume was reduced at month 6 compared to baseline (p<0.001 [see Table 7]). No \n\npatient developed new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure, and none \n\nrequired surgical resection or other therapy for SEGA. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 7 Change in primary SEGA volume over time \n\n \n\nSEGA \n\nvolume \n\n(cm3) \n\nIndependent central review \n\n Baseline \n\nn=28 \n\nMonth 6 \n\nn=27 \n\nMonth 12 \n\nn=26 \n\nMonth 24 \n\nn=24 \n\nMonth 36 \n\nn=23 \n\nMonth 48 \n\nn=24 \n\nMonth 60 \n\nn=23 \n\nPrimary tumour volume \n\nMean \n\n(standard \n\ndeviation) \n\n2.45 \n\n(2.813) \n\n1.33 \n\n(1.497) \n\n1.26 \n\n(1.526) \n\n1.19 \n\n(1.042) \n\n1.26 \n\n(1.298) \n\n1.16 \n\n(0.961) \n\n1.24 \n\n(0.959) \n\nMedian 1.74 0.93 0.84 0.94 1.12 1.02 1.17 \n\n Range 0.49 - 14.\n\n23 \n\n0.31 - 7.9\n\n8 \n\n0.29 - 8.1\n\n8 \n\n0.20 - 4.6\n\n3 \n\n0.22 - 6.5\n\n2 \n\n0.18 - 4.1\n\n9 \n\n0.21 - 4.3\n\n9 \n\nReduction from baseline \n\nMean \n\n(standard \n\ndeviation) \n\n 1.19 \n\n(1.433) \n\n1.07 \n\n(1.276) \n\n1.25 \n\n(1.994) \n\n1.41 \n\n(1.814) \n\n1.43 \n\n(2.267) \n\n1.44 \n\n(2.230) \n\nMedian  0.83 0.85 0.71 0.71 0.83 0.50 \n\n Range  0.06 - 6.2\n\n5 \n\n0.02 - 6.0\n\n5 \n\n-0.55 - 9.6\n\n0 \n\n0.15 - 7.7\n\n1 \n\n0.00 - 10.\n\n96 \n\n-0.74 - 9.8\n\n4 \n\nPercentage reduction from baseline, n (%) \n\n ≥50%  9 (33.3) 9 (34.6) 12 (50.0) 10 (43.5) 14 (58.3) 12 (52.2) \n\n ≥30%  21 (77.8) 20 (76.9) 19 (79.2) 18 (78.3) 19 (79.2) 14 (60.9) \n\n >0%  27 \n\n(100.0) \n\n26 \n\n(100.0) \n\n23 \n\n(95.8) \n\n23 \n\n(100.0) \n\n23 \n\n(95.8) \n\n21 \n\n(91.3) \n\n No \n\nchange \n\n 0 0 0 0 1 (4.2) 0 \n\n Increase  0 0 1 (4.2) 0 0 2 (8.7) \n\n \n\nThe robustness and consistency of the primary analysis were supported by the: \n\n change in primary SEGA volume as per local investigator assessment (p<0.001), with 75.0% \nand 39.3% of patients experiencing reductions of ≥30% and ≥50%, respectively \n\n change in total SEGA volume as per independent central review (p<0.001) or local investigator \nassessment (p<0.001). \n\n \n\nOne patient met the pre-specified criteria for treatment success (>75% reduction in SEGA volume) \n\nand was temporarily taken off trial therapy; however, SEGA re-growth was evident at the next \n\nassessment at 4.5 months and treatment was restarted. \n\n \n\nLong-term follow-up to a median duration of 67.8 months (range: 4.7 to 83.2) demonstrated sustained \n\nefficacy. \n\n \n\nOther studies \n\nStomatitis is the most commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with Votubia (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). In a post-marketing single-arm study in postmenopausal women with advanced \n\nbreast cancer (N=92), topical treatment with dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml alcohol-free oral \n\nsolution was administered as a mouthwash (4 times daily for the initial 8 weeks of treatment) to \n\npatients at the time of initiating treatment with Afinitor (everolimus, 10 mg/day) plus exemestane \n\n(25 mg/day) to reduce the incidence and severity of stomatitis. The incidence of Grade ≥2 \n\nstomatitis at 8 weeks was 2.4% (n=2/85 evaluable patients) which was lower than historically \n\nreported. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 18.8% (n=16/85) and no cases of Grade 3 or 4 \n\nstomatitis were reported. The overall safety profile in this study was consistent with that \n\nestablished for everolimus in the oncology and TSC settings, with the exception of a slightly \n\nincreased frequency of oral candidiasis which was reported in 2.2% (n=2/92) of patients. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVotubia in all subsets of the paediatric population in angiomyolipoma (see section 4.2 for information \n\non paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVotubia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in refractory epilepsy associated with TSC \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nIn patients with advanced solid tumours, peak everolimus concentrations (Cmax) are reached at a \n\nmedian time of 1 hour after daily administration of 5 and 10 mg everolimus under fasting conditions \n\nor with a light fat-free snack. Cmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. Everolimus is a substrate \n\nand moderate inhibitor of PgP. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nIn healthy subjects, high fat meals reduced systemic exposure to Votubia 10 mg tablets (as measured \n\nby AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration Cmax by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by \n\n32% and Cmax by 42%. \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects taking a single 9 mg dose (3 x 3 mg) of Votubia dispersible tablets in suspension, \n\nhigh fat meals reduced AUC by 11.7% and the peak blood concentration Cmax by 59.8%. Light fat \n\nmeals reduced AUC by 29.5% and Cmax by 50.2%. \n\n \n\nFood, however, had no apparent effect on the post absorption phase concentration-time profile \n\n24 hours post-dose of either dosage form. \n\n \n\nRelative bioavailability/bioequivalence \n\nIn a relative bioavailability study, AUC0-inf of 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets when administered as \n\nsuspension in water was equivalent to 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets administered as intact tablets, and \n\nCmax of 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets in suspension was 72% of 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets. \n\n \n\nIn a bioequivalence study, AUC0-inf of the 5 mg dispersible tablet when administered as suspension in \n\nwater was equivalent to 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets, and Cmax of the 5 mg dispersible tablet in \n\nsuspension was 64% of 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to \n\n5,000 ng/ml, is 17% to 73%. Approximately 20% of the everolimus concentration in whole blood is \n\nconfined to plasma of cancer patients given Votubia 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is \n\napproximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In \n\npatients with advanced solid tumours, Vd was 191 l for the apparent central compartment and 517 l for \n\nthe apparent peripheral compartment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n\nNonclinical studies in rats indicate: \n\n A rapid uptake of everolimus in the brain followed by a slow efflux. \n\n The radioactive metabolites of [3H]everolimus do not significantly cross the blood-brain \nbarrier. \n\n A dose-dependent brain penetration of everolimus, which is consistent with the hypothesis of \nsaturation of an efflux pump present in the brain capillary endothelial cells. \n\n The co-administration of the PgP inhibitor, cyclosporine, enhances the exposure of everolimus \nin the brain cortex, which is consistent with the inhibition of PgP at the blood-brain barrier. \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the distribution of everolimus in the human brain. Non-clinical studies in \n\nrats demonstrated distribution into the brain following administration by both the intravenous and oral \n\nroutes. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main \n\ncirculating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in \n\nhuman blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, \n\nand a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal \n\nspecies used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus \n\nitself. Hence, everolimus is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacological \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMean CL/F of everolimus after 10 mg daily dose in patients with advanced solid tumours was 24.5 l/h. \n\nThe mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. \n\n \n\nNo specific excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; however, data are available \n\nfrom the studies in transplant patients. Following the administration of a single dose of radiolabelled \n\neverolimus in conjunction with ciclosporin, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the faeces, \n\nwhile 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or faeces. \n\n \n\nSteady-state pharmacokinetics \n\n \n\nAfter administration of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumours, steady-state AUC0-τ was \n\ndose-proportional over the range of 5 to 10 mg daily dose. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks. \n\nCmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. tmax occurs at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. There was a \n\nsignificant correlation between AUC0-τ and pre-dose trough concentration at steady-state. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Votubia were evaluated in two single oral dose \n\nstudies of Votubia tablets in 8 and 34 adult subjects with impaired hepatic function relative to subjects \n\nwith normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nIn the first study, the average AUC of everolimus in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh B) was twice that found in 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nIn the second study of 34 subjects with different impaired hepatic function compared to normal \n\nsubjects, there was a 1.6-fold, 3.3-fold and 3.6-fold increase in exposure (i.e. AUC0-inf) for subjects \n\nwith mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\nSimulations of multiple dose pharmacokinetics support the dosing recommendations in subjects with \n\nhepatic impairment based on their Child-Pugh status. \n\n \n\nBased on the results of the two studies, dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 patients with advanced solid tumours, no significant \n\ninfluence of creatinine clearance (25-178 ml/min) was detected on CL/F of everolimus. Post-transplant \n\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance range 11-107 ml/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\neverolimus in transplant patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn patients with SEGA, everolimus Cmin was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range \n\nfrom 1.35 mg/m2 to 14.4 mg/m2. \n\n \n\nIn patients with SEGA, the geometric mean Cmin values normalised to mg/m2 dose in patients aged \n\n<10 years and 10-18 years were lower by 54% and 40%, respectively, than those observed in adults \n\n(>18 years of age), suggesting that everolimus clearance was higher in younger patients. Limited data \n\nin patients <3 years of age (n=13) indicate that BSA-normalised clearance is about two-fold higher in \n\npatients with low BSA (BSA of 0.556 m2) than in adults. Therefore it is assumed that steady-state \n\ncould be reached earlier in patients <3 years of age (see section 4.2 for dosing recommendations). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of everolimus have not been studied in patients younger than 1 year of age. It is \n\nreported, however, that CYP3A4 activity is reduced at birth and increases during the first year of life, \n\nwhich could affect the clearance in this patient population. \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis including 111 patients with SEGA who ranged from 1.0 to \n\n27.4 years (including 18 patients 1 to less than 3 years of age with BSA 0.42 m2 to 0.74 m2) showed \n\nthat BSA-normalised clearance is in general higher in younger patients. Population pharmacokinetic \n\nmodel simulations showed that a starting dose of 7 mg/m2 would be necessary to attain Cmin within the \n\n5 to 15 ng/ml range in patients younger than 3 years of age. A higher starting dose of 7 mg/m2 is \n\ntherefore recommended for patients 1 to less than 3 years of age with SEGA (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in cancer patients, no significant influence of age \n\n(27-85 years) on oral clearance of everolimus was detected. \n\n \n\nEthnicity \n\nOral clearance (CL/F) is similar in Japanese and Caucasian cancer patients with similar liver \n\nfunctions. Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% \n\nhigher in black transplant patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe non-clinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipigs, monkeys and \n\nrabbits. The major target organs were male and female reproductive systems (testicular tubular \n\ndegeneration, reduced sperm content in epididymides and uterine atrophy) in several species; lungs \n\n(increased alveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; pancreas (degranulation and vacuolation of \n\nexocrine cells in monkeys and minipigs, respectively, and degeneration of islet cells in monkeys), and \n\neyes (lenticular anterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney changes were seen in the rat \n\n(exacerbation of age-related lipofuscin in tubular epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse \n\n(exacerbation of background lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys or \n\nminipigs. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nEverolimus appeared to spontaneously exacerbate background diseases (chronic myocarditis in rats, \n\ncoxsackie virus infection of plasma and heart in monkeys, coccidian infestation of the gastrointestinal \n\ntract in minipigs, skin lesions in mice and monkeys). These findings were generally observed at \n\nsystemic exposure levels within the range of therapeutic exposure or above, with the exception of the \n\nfindings in rats, which occurred below therapeutic exposure due to a high tissue distribution. \n\n \n\nIn a male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm \n\nmotility, sperm head count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished at 5 mg/kg, which is \n\nwithin the range of therapeutic exposure and which caused a reduction in male fertility. There was \n\nevidence of reversibility. \n\n \n\nIn animal reproductive studies female fertility was not affected. However, oral doses of everolimus in \n\nfemale rats at ≥ 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% of the AUC0-24h in patients receiving the 10 mg daily \n\ndose) resulted in increases in pre-implantation loss. \n\n \n\nEverolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the foetus. In rats, everolimus caused \n\nembryo/foetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the therapeutic level. This was manifested as \n\nmortality and reduced foetal weight. The incidence of skeletal variations and malformations (e.g. \n\nsternal cleft) was increased at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg. In rabbits, embryotoxicity was evident in an increase \n\nin late resorptions. \n\n \n\nIn juvenile rat toxicity studies, systemic toxicity included decreased body weight gain, food \n\nconsumption, and delayed attainment of some developmental landmarks, with full or partial recovery \n\nafter cessation of dosing. With the possible exception of the rat-specific lens finding (where young \n\nanimals appeared to be more susceptible), it appears that there is no significant difference in the \n\nsensitivity of juvenile animals to the adverse reactions of everolimus as compared to adult animals. \n\nToxicity study with juvenile monkeys did not show any relevant toxicity. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of clastogenic or \n\nmutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate any oncogenic \n\npotential in mice and rats up to the highest doses, corresponding respectively to 4.3 and 0.2 times the \n\nestimated clinical exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRefractory seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) \n\n \n\nVotubia is indicated as adjunctive treatment of patients aged 2 years and older whose refractory \n\npartial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, are associated with TSC. \n\n \n\nSubependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC \n\n \n\nVotubia is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with SEGA associated with TSC \n\nwho require therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to surgery. \n\n \n\nThe evidence is based on analysis of change in SEGA volume. Further clinical benefit, such as \n\nimprovement in disease-related symptoms, has not been demonstrated. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Votubia should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients \n\nwith TSC and therapeutic drug monitoring. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nCareful titration may be required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Doses that will be tolerated \n\nand effective vary between patients. Concomitant antiepileptic therapy may affect the metabolism of \n\neverolimus and may contribute to this variance (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nDosing is individualised based on Body Surface Area (BSA) using the Dubois formula, where weight \n\n(W) is in kilograms and height (H) is in centimetres: \n\nBSA = (W0.425 x H0.725) x 0.007184 \n\n \n\nStarting dose and target trough concentrations in SEGA associated with TSC \n\nThe recommended starting dose for Votubia for the treatment of patients with SEGA is 4.5 mg/m2. A \n\nhigher starting dose of 7 mg/m2 is recommended for patients 1 to less than 3 years of age based on \n\npharmacokinetic simulations (see section 5.2). Different strengths of Votubia dispersible tablets can be \n\ncombined to attain the desired dose. \n\n \n\nDosing recommendations for paediatric patients with SEGA are consistent with those for the adult \n\nSEGA population, except for patients in the range from 1 year to less than 3 years of age, and those \n\nwith hepatic impairment (see section “Hepatic impairment” below and section 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\nStarting dose and target trough concentrations in TSC with refractory seizures \n\nThe recommended starting dose for Votubia for the treatment of patients with seizures is shown in \n\nTable 1. Different strengths of Votubia dispersible tablets can be combined to attain the desired dose. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Votubia starting dose for patients with TSC and refractory seizures \n\n \n\nAge Starting dose without \n\nco-administration of \n\nCYP3A4/PgP inducer \n\nStarting dose with \n\nco-administration of \n\nCYP3A4/PgP inducer \n\n<6 years 6 mg/m2 9 mg/m2 \n\n≥6 years 5 mg/m2 8 mg/m2 \n\n \n\nDosing recommendations for paediatric patients with seizures are consistent with those for the adult \n\npopulation, except for patients in the range from 2 years to less than 6 years of age, and those with \n\nhepatic impairment (see section “Hepatic impairment” below and section 5.2). \n\n \n\nDose monitoring \n\nEverolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be assessed at least 1 week after commencing \n\ntreatment. Dosing should be titrated to attain trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/ml. The dose may be \n\nincreased to attain a higher trough concentration within the target range to obtain optimal efficacy, \n\nsubject to tolerability. \n\n \n\nTitration \n\nIndividualised dosing should be titrated by increasing the dose by increments of 1 to 4 mg to attain the \n\ntarget trough concentration for optimal clinical response. Efficacy, safety, concomitant therapy, and \n\nthe current trough concentration should be considered when planning for dose titration. Individualised \n\ndose titration can be based on simple proportion: \n\nNew everolimus dose = current dose x (target concentration / current concentration) \n\n \n\nFor example, a patient’s current dose based on BSA is 4 mg with a steady-state concentration of \n\n4 ng/ml. In order to achieve a target concentration above the lower Cmin limit of 5 ng/ml, e.g. 8 ng/ml, \n\nthe new everolimus dose would be 8 mg (an increase of 4 mg from the current daily dose). \n\n \n\nLong-term monitoring \n\nFor patients with TSC who have SEGA, SEGA volume should be evaluated approximately 3 months \n\nafter commencing Votubia therapy, with subsequent dose adjustments taking changes in SEGA \n\nvolume, corresponding trough concentration, and tolerability into consideration. \n\n \n\nFor patients with TSC who have SEGA and patients with TSC and refractory seizures, once a stable \n\ndose is attained, trough concentrations should be monitored every 3 to 6 months in patients with \n\nchanging BSA, or every 6 to 12 months in patients with stable BSA, for the duration of treatment. \n\n \n\nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the usual prescribed next \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments due to adverse reactions \n\nManagement of severe and/or intolerable suspected adverse reactions may require dose reduction \n\nand/or temporary interruption of Votubia therapy. For adverse reactions of Grade 1, dose adjustment is \n\nusually not required. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose is approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the daily dose previously administered. For dose reductions below the lowest available strength, \n\nalternate day dosing should be considered. \n\n \n\nTable 2 summarises dose adjustment recommendations for specific adverse reactions (see also \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nTable 2 Votubia dose adjustment recommendations \n\n \n\nAdverse reaction Severity1 Votubia dose adjustment \n\nNon-infectious \n\npneumonitis \n\nGrade 2 Consider interruption of therapy until symptoms improve to \n\nGrade 1. \n\nRe-initiate Votubia at approximately 50% lower than the \n\ndaily dose previously administered. \n\nDiscontinue treatment if failure to recover within 4 weeks. \n\n Grade 3 Interrupt Votubia until symptoms resolve to Grade 1. \n\nConsider re-initiating Votubia at approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the daily dose previously administered.

Re-initiate Votubia at same dose. \n\nIf toxicity recurs at Grade 2, interrupt Votubia until recovery \n\nto Grade 1. Re-initiate Votubia at approximately 50% \n\nlower than the daily dose previously administered. \n\n Grade 3 Temporary dose interruption until recovery to Grade 1. \n\nConsider re-initiating Votubia at approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the daily dose previously administered. If toxicity \n\nrecurs at Grade 3, consider discontinuation. \n\n Grade 4 Discontinue Votubia. \n\nMetabolic events \n\n(e.g. \n\nhyperglycaemia, \n\ndyslipidaemia) \n\nGrade 2 No dose adjustment required. \n\n Grade 3 Temporary dose interruption. \n\nRe-initiate Votubia at approximately 50% lower than the \n\ndaily dose previously administered. \n\n Grade 4 Discontinue Votubia. \n\nThrombocytopenia Grade 2 \n\n(<75, ≥50x109/l) \nTemporary dose interruption until recovery to Grade 1 \n\n(≥75x109/l).

Trough concentrations should be assessed 2 to 4 weeks after \n\ninitiation of or change in co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) since the \n\nnatural degradation time of the induced enzymes has to be taken into account. When possible, the \n\nsame assay and laboratory for therapeutic drug monitoring should be used throughout the treatment. \n\n \n\nSwitching pharmaceutical forms \n\nVotubia is available in two pharmaceutical forms: tablets and dispersible tablets. Votubia tablets and \n\nVotubia dispersible tablets are not to be used interchangeably. The two pharmaceutical forms must not \n\nbe combined to achieve the desired dose. The same pharmaceutical form must be used consistently, as \n\nappropriate for the indication being treated. \n\n \n\nWhen switching pharmaceutical forms, the dose should be adjusted to the closest milligram strength of \n\nthe new pharmaceutical form and the everolimus trough concentration should be assessed at least \n\n1 week later (see section “Therapeutic drug monitoring” above). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients <18 years of age: \n\nVotubia is not recommended for patients <18 years of age with SEGA or refractory seizures and \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nPatients ≥18 years of age: \n\n Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A): 75% of the recommended starting dose calculated \nbased on BSA (rounded to the nearest strength) \n\n Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B): 50% of the recommended starting dose \ncalculated based on BSA (rounded to the nearest strength) \n\n Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): Votubia is only recommended if the desired benefit \noutweighs the risk. In this case, 25% of the dose calculated based on BSA (rounded to the \n\nnearest strength) must not be exceeded. \n\nEverolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be assessed at least 1 week after any change in \n\nhepatic status (Child-Pugh). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of Votubia in children below the age of 1 year with \n\nTSC who have SEGA have not been established. No data are available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of Votubia in children below the age of 2 years with \n\nTSC and refractory seizures have not been established. No data are available (see sections 5.1 and \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nClinical study results did not show an impact of Votubia on growth and pubertal development. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nVotubia must be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, consistently either with or \n\nwithout food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nVotubia dispersible tablets are to be taken as a suspension only and must not be swallowed whole, \n\nchewed, or crushed. The suspension can be prepared either in an oral syringe or in a small glass. Care \n\nshould be taken to ensure the entire dose is ingested. \n\n \n\nThe suspension must be administered immediately after preparation. If not administered within \n\n30 minutes of preparation when using an oral syringe or 60 minutes when using a small glass, the \n\nsuspension must be discarded and a new suspension must be prepared (see section 6.3). Only water \n\nshould be used as the vehicle. \n\n \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis \n\n \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) was described very commonly in \n\npatients taking everolimus in the advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) setting (see section 4.8). Some \n\ncases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed. A diagnosis of non-infectious \n\npneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and \n\nsymptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough or dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic \n\nand other non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. \n\nOpportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) should be \n\nruled out in the differential diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis (see section “Infections” below). \n\nPatients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. \n\n \n\nPatients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or \n\nno symptoms may continue Votubia therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms are moderate, \n\nconsideration should be given to interruption of therapy until symptoms improve. The use of \n\ncorticosteroids may be indicated. Votubia may be reinitiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower \n\nthan the dose previously administered. \n\n \n\nFor cases where symptoms of non-infectious pneumonitis are severe, Votubia therapy should be \n\ndiscontinued and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Votubia \n\nmay be reinitiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered \n\ndepending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nFor patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, \n\nprophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) may be considered. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nEverolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral \n\nor protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens (see section 4.8). Localised \n\nand systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections \n\nsuch as aspergillosis, candidiasis or pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) and viral \n\ninfections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking \n\neverolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to sepsis [including septic shock], \n\nrespiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally fatal in adult and paediatric patients (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPhysicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Votubia. Pre-existing \n\ninfections should be treated appropriately and should have resolved fully before starting treatment \n\nwith Votubia. While taking Votubia, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of \n\ninfection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation \n\nof Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, Votubia treatment should be promptly and \n\npermanently discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate antifungal therapy. \n\n \n\nCases of pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP), some with fatal outcome, have been \n\nreported in patients who received everolimus. PJP/PCP may be associated with concomitant use of \n\ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis for PJP/PCP should be considered \n\nwhen concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, \n\ndyspnoea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without \n\nrespiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n\n \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nStomatitis \n\n \n\nStomatitis, including mouth ulcerations and oral mucositis, is the most commonly reported adverse \n\nreaction in patients treated with Votubia (see section 4.8). Stomatitis mostly occurs within the first \n\n8 weeks of treatment. A single-arm study in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with \n\nAfinitor (everolimus) plus exemestane suggested that an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution, \n\nadministered as a mouthwash during the initial 8 weeks of treatment, may decrease the incidence and \n\nseverity of stomatitis (see section 5.1). Management of stomatitis may therefore include prophylactic \n\n(in adults) and/or therapeutic use of topical treatments, such as an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral \n\nsolution as a mouthwash. However products containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and thyme \n\nderivatives should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Monitoring for and treatment of \n\nfungal infection is recommended, especially in patients being treated with steroid-based medicinal \n\nproducts. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nSerious cases of haemorrhage, some with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with \n\neverolimus in the oncology setting. No serious cases of renal haemorrhage were reported in the TSC \n\nsetting. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised in patients taking Votubia, particularly during concomitant use with active \n\nsubstances known to affect platelet function or that can increase the risk of haemorrhage as well as in \n\npatients with a history of bleeding disorders. Healthcare professionals and patients should be vigilant \n\nfor signs and symptoms of bleeding throughout the treatment period, especially if risk factors for \n\nhaemorrhage are combined. \n\n \n\nRenal failure events \n\n \n\nCases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in \n\npatients treated with Votubia (see section 4.8). Renal function of patients should be monitored \n\nparticularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function. \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests and monitoring \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\nElevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea \n\nnitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of Votubia \n\ntherapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nBlood glucose \n\nHyperglycaemia has been reported in patients taking Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of fasting \n\nserum glucose is recommended prior to the start of Votubia therapy and periodically thereafter. More \n\nfrequent monitoring is recommended when Votubia is co-administered with other medicinal products \n\nthat may induce hyperglycaemia. When possible optimal glycaemic control should be achieved before \n\nstarting a patient on Votubia. \n\n \n\nBlood lipids \n\nDyslipidaemia (including hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) has been reported in \n\npatients taking Votubia. Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of Votubia \n\ntherapy and periodically thereafter, as well as management with appropriate medical therapy, is also \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nHaematological parameters \n\nDecreased haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Votubia (see section 4.8). Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start \n\nof Votubia therapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nCo-administration with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or the multidrug efflux pump \n\nP-glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. If co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP \n\ninhibitor or inducer cannot be avoided, dose adjustments of Votubia may be required (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors result in dramatically increased blood \n\nconcentrations of everolimus (see section 4.5). There are currently not sufficient data to allow dosing \n\nrecommendations in this situation. Hence, concomitant treatment of Votubia and potent inhibitors is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nCaution should be exercised when Votubia is taken in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic index due to the potential for drug interactions. If Votubia is \n\ntaken with orally administered CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. pimozide, \n\nterfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, quinidine, ergot alkaloid derivatives or carbamazepine), the patient \n\nshould be monitored for undesirable effects described in the product information of the orally \n\nadministered CYP3A4 substrate (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nVotubia is not recommended for use in patients: \n\n ≥18 years of age with SEGA or refractory seizures and concomitant severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh C) unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk (see sections 4.2 and \n\n5.2). \n\n <18 years of age with SEGA or refractory seizures and concomitant hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh A, B and C) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nThe use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Votubia (see section 4.5). For \n\npaediatric patients who do not require immediate treatment, completion of the recommended \n\nchildhood series of live virus vaccinations is advised prior to the start of therapy according to local \n\ntreatment guidelines. \n\n \n\nWound healing complications \n\n \n\nImpaired wound healing is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including Votubia. Caution should \n\ntherefore be exercised with the use of Votubia in the peri-surgical period. \n\n \n\nLactose \n\n \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. Therefore, \n\nabsorption and subsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by products that affect \n\nCYP3A4 and/or PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor \n\nof CYP2D6. \n\n \n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and PgP are \n\nlisted in Table 3 below. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors increasing everolimus concentrations \n\n \n\nSubstances that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may increase everolimus blood concentrations by \n\ndecreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inducers decreasing everolimus concentrations \n\n \n\nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP may decrease everolimus blood concentrations by \n\nincreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nTable 3 Effects of other active substances on everolimus \n\n \n\nActive substance by \n\ninteraction \n\n \n\nInteraction – Change in \n\nEverolimus AUC/Cmax \n\nGeometric mean ratio \n\n(observed range) \n\nRecommendations concerning \n\nco-administration \n\nPotent CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors \n\nKetoconazole AUC ↑15.3-fold \n\n(range 11.2-22.5) \n\nCmax ↑4.1-fold \n\n(range 2.6-7.0) \n\nConcomitant treatment of Votubia \n\nand potent inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended. \n\nItraconazole, \n\nposaconazole, \n\nvoriconazole \n\nNot studied.

Further dose \n\nreduction may be required to manage \n\nadverse reactions (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). Everolimus trough \n\nconcentrations should be assessed at \n\nleast 1 week after the addition of a \n\nmoderate CYP3A4 or PgP inhibitor. \n\nIf the moderate inhibitor is \n\ndiscontinued, consider a washout \n\nperiod of at least 2 to 3 days \n\n(average elimination time for most \n\ncommonly used moderate inhibitors) \n\nbefore the Votubia dose is returned \n\nto the dose used prior to initiation of \n\nthe co-administration.

Dosing should be \n\ntitrated to attain trough \n\nconcentrations of 5 to 15 ng/ml as \n\ndescribed below. \n\n \n\nPatients with seizures receiving \n\nconcomitant strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g., enzyme inducing \n\nantiepileptics carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, and phenytoin) at the \n\nstart of treatment with everolimus \n\nrequire an increased starting dose to \n\nattain trough concentrations of 5 to \n\n15 ng/ml (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nFor patients not receiving \n\nconcomitant strong inducers at the \n\nstart of everolimus treatment, the \n\nco-administration may require an \n\nincreased Votubia dose. If \n\nconcentrations are below 5 ng/ml, \n\nthe daily dose may be increased by \n\nincrements of 1 to 4 mg, checking \n\nthe trough level and assessing \n\ntolerability before increasing the \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nThe addition of another concomitant \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducer may not \n\nrequire additional dose adjustment. \n\nAssess the everolimus trough level \n\n2 weeks after initiating the additional \n\ninducer. Adjust the dose by \n\nincrements of 1 to 4 mg as necessary \n\nto maintain the target trough \n\nconcentration. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of one of multiple \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inducers may not \n\nrequire additional dose adjustment. \n\nAssess the everolimus trough level \n\n2 weeks after discontinuation of one \n\nof multiple strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. If all potent inducers are \n\ndiscontinued, consider a washout \n\nperiod of at least 3 to 5 days \n\n(reasonable time for significant \n\nenzyme de-induction) before the \n\nDexamethasone Not studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\nAntiepileptics (e.g. \n\ncarbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin) \n\nNot studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\nEfavirenz, nevirapine Not studied. Decreased \n\nexposure expected. \n\n\n\n41 \n\nVotubia dose is returned to the dose \n\nused prior to initiation of the \n\nco-administration. The everolimus \n\ntrough concentrations should be \n\nassessed 2 to 4 weeks later since the \n\nnatural degradation time of the \n\ninduced enzymes has to be taken into \n\naccount (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nSt John’s Wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum) \n\nNot studied. Large decrease in \n\nexposure expected. \n\nPreparations containing St John’s \n\nWort should not be used during \n\ntreatment with everolimus \n\n \n\nAgents whose plasma concentration may be altered by everolimus \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro results, the systemic concentrations obtained after oral daily doses of 10 mg make \n\ninhibition of PgP, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 unlikely. However, inhibition of CYP3A4 and PgP in the \n\ngut cannot be excluded. An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration \n\nof an oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% \n\nincrease in midazolam Cmax and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC(0-inf). The effect is likely to be due \n\nto inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by everolimus. Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of \n\norally co-administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of \n\nsystemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn EXIST-3 (Study CRAD001M2304), everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the \n\nantiepileptics carbamazepine, clobazam, and the clobazam metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about \n\n10%. The increase in the pre-dose concentrations of these antiepileptics may not be clinically \n\nsignificant but dose adjustments for antiepileptics with a narrow therapeutic index, e.g carbamazepine, \n\nmay be considered. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of antiepileptics that are \n\nsubstrates of CYP3A4 (clonazepam, diazepam, felbamate and zonisamide). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors \n\n \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nConcomitant ketogenic diet \n\n \n\nThe effect of a ketogenic diet may be mediated through mTOR inhibition. In the absence of clinical \n\ndata, the possibility of an additive effect on adverse events cannot be excluded when everolimus is \n\ngiven in conjunction with a ketogenic diet. \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nThe immune response to vaccination may be affected and, therefore, vaccination may be less effective \n\nduring treatment with Votubia. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with \n\nVotubia. Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, \n\nBCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, \n\ninjected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based \n\ncontraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device \n\n[IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after \n\nending treatment. \n\n \n\nMale patients should not be prohibited from attempting to father children. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The \n\npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nEverolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus \n\nand/or its metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus \n\nshould not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however \n\nsecondary amenorrhoea and associated luteinising hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) \n\nimbalance has been observed in female patients (see also section 5.3 for preclinical observations on \n\nthe male and female reproductive systems). Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility \n\nmay be compromised by treatment with everolimus (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nVotubia has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \n\nadvised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue during treatment \n\nwith Votubia. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThree randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal phase III studies, including double-blind \n\nand open label treatment periods, and a non-randomised, open-label, single-arm phase II study \n\ncontribute to the safety profile of Votubia (n=612, including 409 patients <18 years of age; median \n\nduration of exposure 36.8 months [range 0.5 to 83.2]). \n\n EXIST-3 (CRAD001M2304): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial \ncomparing adjunctive treatment of low and high everolimus exposure (low trough [LT] range of \n\n3-7 ng/ml [n=117] and high trough [HT] range of 9-15 ng/ml [n=130]) versus placebo (n=119), \n\nin patients with TSC and refractory partial-onset seizures receiving 1 to 3 antiepileptics. The \n\nmedian duration of the double-blind period was 18 weeks. The cumulative median duration \n\nexposure to Votubia (361 patients who took at least one dose of everolimus) was 30.4 months \n\n(range 0.5 to 48.8). \n\n EXIST-2 (CRAD001M2302): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial of \neverolimus (n=79) versus placebo (n=39) in patients with either TSC plus renal \n\nangiomyolipoma (n=113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) plus renal \n\nangiomyolipoma (n=5). The median duration of blinded study treatment was 48.1 weeks (range \n\n2 to 115) for patients receiving Votubia and 45.0 weeks (range 9 to 115) for those receiving \n\nplacebo. The cumulative median duration of exposure to Votubia (112 patients who took at least \n\none dose of everolimus) was 46.9 months (range 0.5 to 63.9). \n\n EXIST-1 (CRAD001M2301): This was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase III trial of \neverolimus (n=78) versus placebo (n=39) in patients with TSC who have SEGA, irrespective of \n\nage. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 52.2 weeks (range 24 to 89) for \n\npatients receiving Votubia and 46.6 weeks (range 14 to 88) for those receiving placebo. The \n\ncumulative median duration of exposure to Votubia (111 patients who took at least one dose of \n\neverolimus) was 47.1 months (range 1.9 to 58.3). \n\n CRAD001C2485: This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm phase II study of everolimus \nin patients with SEGA (n=28). The median duration of exposure was 67.8 months (range 4.7 to \n\n83.2). \n\n \n\nThe adverse events considered to be associated with the use of Votubia (adverse reactions), based \n\nupon the review and medical assessment of all adverse events reported in the above studies, are \n\ndescribed below. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions (incidence ≥1/10) from the pooled safety data are (in decreasing \n\norder): stomatitis, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, \n\ncough, rash, headache, amenorrhoea, acne, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sinusitis, menstruation \n\nirregular, pharyngitis, decreased appetite, fatigue, hypercholesterolaemia, and hypertension. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) were pneumonia, stomatitis, \n\namenorrhoea, neutropenia, pyrexia, menstruation irregular, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea, and \n\ncellulitis. The grades follow CTCAE Version 3.0 and 4.03. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 4 shows the incidence of adverse reactions based on pooled data of patients receiving \n\neverolimus in the three TSC studies (including both the double-blind and open-label extension phase, \n\nwhere applicable). Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nTable 4 Adverse reactions reported in TSC studies \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia a, urinary tract \n\ninfection, sinusitis, pharyngitis \n\nCommon Otitis media, cellulitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, gastroenteritis viral, gingivitis \n\nUncommon Herpes zoster, sepsis, bronchitis viral \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon Anaemia, neutropenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common Decreased appetite, hypercholesterolaemia \n\nCommon Hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypophosphataemia, hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon Insomnia, aggression, irritability \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common Headache \n\nUncommon Dysgeusia \n\nVascular disorders \n\nVery common Hypertension \n\nCommon Lymphoedema \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Cough \n\nCommon Epistaxis, pneumonitis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Stomatitis b, diarrhoea, vomiting \n\nCommon Constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, oral pain, gastritis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common Rash c, acne \n\nCommon Dry skin, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, alopecia \n\nUncommon Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Rhabdomyolysis \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon Proteinuria \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nVery common Amenorrhoea d, menstruation irregular d \n\nCommon Menorrhagia, ovarian cyst, vaginal haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Menstruation delayed d \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia, fatigue \n\nInvestigations \n\nCommon Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood luteinising hormone increased, \n\nweight decreased \n\nUncommon Blood follicle stimulating hormone increased \na Includes pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP) \nb Includes (very common) stomatitis, mouth ulceration, aphthous ulcer; (common) tongue \n\nulceration, lip ulceration and (uncommon) gingival pain, glossitis \nc Includes (very common) rash; (common) rash erythematous, erythema, and (uncommon) rash \n\ngeneralised, rash maculo-papular, rash macular \nd Frequency based upon number of women from 10 to 55 years of age while on treatment in the \n\npooled data \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, everolimus has been associated with serious cases of hepatitis B reactivation, \n\nincluding fatal outcome. Reactivation of infection is an expected reaction during periods of \n\nimmunosuppression. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with renal \n\nfailure events (including fatal outcome), proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. Monitoring of \n\nrenal function is recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, everolimus has been associated with haemorrhage events. On rare occasions, fatal \n\noutcomes were observed in the oncology setting (see section 4.4). No serious cases of renal \n\nhaemorrhage were reported in the TSC setting. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases \n\nof pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP, PCP), some with fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n \n\nAdditional adverse reactions of relevance observed in oncology clinical studies and post-marketing \n\nspontaneous reports, were cardiac failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, impaired \n\nwound healing and hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, angioedema has been reported with and \n\nwithout concomitant use of ACE inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal phase II study, 22 of the 28 SEGA patients studied were below the age of 18 years and \n\nin the pivotal phase III study, 101 of the 117 SEGA patients studied were below the age of 18 years. In \n\nthe pivotal phase III study in patients with TSC and refractory seizures, 299 of the 366 patients studied \n\nwere below the age of 18 years. The overall type, frequency and severity of adverse reactions observed \n\nin children and adolescents have been generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the \n\nexception of infections which were reported at a higher frequency and severity in children below the \n\nage of 6 years. A total of 49 out of 137 patients (36%) aged <6 years had Grade 3/4 infections, \n\ncompared to 53 out of 272 patients (19%) aged 6 to <18 years and 27 out of 203 patients (13%) aged \n\n≥18 years. Two fatal cases due to infection were reported in 409 patients aged <18 years receiving \n\neverolimus. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nIn the oncology safety pooling, 37% of the patients treated with everolimus were ≥65 years of age. \n\nThe number of oncology patients with an adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of everolimus \n\nwas higher in patients ≥65 years of age (20% versus 13%). The most common adverse reactions \n\nleading to discontinuation were pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease), fatigue, dyspnoea, \n\nand stomatitis. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nReported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 70 mg have been \n\ngiven with acceptable acute tolerability in the adult population. \n\n \n\nIt is essential to assess everolimus blood levels in cases of suspected overdose. General supportive \n\nmeasures should be initiated in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialysable to any \n\nrelevant degree (less than 10% was removed within 6 hours of haemodialysis). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA limited number of paediatric patients have been exposed to doses higher than 10 mg/m2/day. No \n\nsigns of acute toxicity have been reported in these cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, protein kinase \n\ninhibitors, ATC code: L01XE10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nEverolimus is a selective mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR is a key \n\nserine-threonine kinase, the activity of which is known to be upregulated in a number of human \n\ncancers. Everolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12, forming a complex that inhibits \n\nmTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity. Inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway interferes with \n\nthe translation and synthesis of proteins by reducing the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase \n\n(S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP-1) that regulate proteins involved \n\nin the cell cycle, angiogenesis and glycolysis. Everolimus can reduce levels of vascular endothelial \n\ngrowth factor (VEGF). In patients with TSC, treatment with everolimus increases VEGF-A and \n\ndecreases VEGF-D levels. Everolimus is a potent inhibitor of the growth and proliferation of tumour \n\ncells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and blood-vessel-associated smooth muscle cells and has been \n\nshown to reduce glycolysis in solid tumours in vitro and in vivo. \n\n \n\nTwo primary regulators of mTORC1 signalling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis \n\ncomplexes 1 & 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to elevated rheb-GTP levels, a \n\nras family GTPase, which interacts with the mTORC1 complex to cause its activation. mTORC1 \n\nactivation leads to a downstream kinase signalling cascade, including activation of the S6 kinases. In \n\nTSC syndrome, inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation \n\nthroughout the body. Besides pathological changes in brain tissue (such as cortical tubers) which may \n\ncause seizures, the mTOR pathway is also implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in TSC. The \n\nmTOR regulates protein synthesis and multiple downstream cellular functions that may influence \n\nneuronal excitability and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, \n\naberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced \n\nmyelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal \n\ndevelopment and function. Preclinical studies in models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain \n\ndemonstrated that treatment with an mTOR inhibitor such as everolimus could prolong survival, \n\nsuppress seizures, prevent the development of new-onset seizures and prevent premature death. In \n\nsummary, everolimus is highly active in this neuronal model of TSC, with benefit apparently \n\nattributable to effects on mTORC1 inhibition. However, the exact mechanism of action in the \n\nreduction of seizures associated with TSC is not fully elucidated. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPhase III study in patients with TSC and refractory seizures \n\nEXIST-3 (Study CRAD001M2304), a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, three-arm, \n\nparallel-group phase III study of Votubia versus placebo as adjunctive therapy was conducted in TSC \n\npatients with refractory partial-onset seizures. In the study, partial-onset seizures were defined as all \n\nelectroencephalogram (EEG)-confirmed sensory seizures or motor seizures in which a generalised \n\nonset had not been demonstrated on a past EEG. Patients were treated with concomitant and stable \n\ndose of 1 to 3 antiepileptics prior to study entry. The study consisted of three phases: an 8-week \n\nbaseline observation phase; an 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled core treatment phase \n\n(composed of titration and maintenance periods), an extension phase of ≥48 weeks in which all \n\npatients received Votubia and a post-extension phase of ≤48 weeks in which all patients received \n\nVotubia. \n\n \n\nThe study independently tested two different primary endpoints: 1) response rate defined as at least a \n\n50% reduction from baseline in frequency of partial-onset seizures during the maintenance period of \n\nthe core phase; and 2) percentage reduction from baseline in frequency of partial-onset seizures during \n\nthe maintenance period of the core phase. \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints included seizure freedom, proportion of patients with >25% seizure frequency \n\nreduction from baseline, distribution of reduction from baseline in seizure frequency (≤-25%, >-25% \n\nto <25%; ≥25% to <50%; ≥50% to <75%; ≥75% to <100%; 100%), long-term evaluation of seizure \n\nfrequency and overall quality of life. \n\n \n\nA total of 366 patients were randomised in a 1:1.09:1 ratio to Votubia (n=117) low trough (LT) range \n\n(3 to 7 ng/ml), Votubia (n=130) high trough (HT) range (9 to 15 ng/ml) or placebo (n=119). The \n\nmedian age for the total population was 10.1 years (range: 2.2-56.3; 28.4% <6 years, 30.9% 6 to \n\n<12 years, 22.4% 12 to <18 years and 18.3% >18 years). Median duration of treatment was 18 weeks \n\nfor all three arms in the core phase and 90 weeks (21 months) when considering both the core and \n\nextension phases. \n\n \n\nAt baseline, 19.4% of patients had focal seizures with retained awareness (sensory previously \n\nconfirmed on EEG or motor), 45.1% had focal seizures with impaired awareness (predominantly \n\nnon-motor), 69.1% had focal motor seizures (i.e. focal motor seizures with impaired awareness and/or \n\nsecondary generalised seizures), and 1.6% had generalised onset seizures (previously confirmed by \n\nEEG). The median baseline seizure frequency across the treatment arms was 35, 38, and 42 seizures \n\nper 28 days for the Votubia LT, Votubia HT, and placebo groups, respectively. The majority of \n\npatients (67%) failed 5 or more antiepileptics prior to the study and 41.0% and 47.8% of patients were \n\ntaking 2 and ≥3 antiepileptics during the study. The baseline data indicated mild to moderate mental \n\nretardation in patients 6-18 years of age (scores of 60-70 on the Adaptive Behavior Composite and \n\nCommunication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization Domain Scores). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\nThe efficacy results for the primary endpoint are summarised in Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5 EXIST-3 – Seizure frequency response rate (primary endpoint) \n\n \n\n Votubia Placebo \n\n \n\nLT target of \n\n3-7 ng/ml \n\nHT target of \n\n9-15 ng/ml  \n\nStatistic N=117 N=130 N=119 \n\nResponders – n (%) 33 (28.2) 52 (40.0) 18 (15.1) \n\n Response rate 95% CI a 20.3, 37.3 31.5, 49.0 9.2, 22.8 \n\nOdds ratio (versus placebo) b 2.21 3.93  \n\n 95% CI 1.16, 4.20 2.10, 7.32  \n\n p-value (versus placebo) c 0.008 <0.001  \n\n Statistically significant per Bonferroni-Holm \n\nprocedure d \n\nYes Yes  \n\nNon-responders – n (%) 84 (71.8) 78 (60.0) 101 (84.9) \na Exact 95% CI obtained using Clopper-Pearson method \nb Odds ratio and its 95% CI obtained using logistic regression stratified by age subgroup.

Patients were \n\nrandomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Votubia or matching placebo. Presence of at least one \n\nSEGA lesion ≥1.0 cm in longest diameter using MRI (based on local radiology assessment) was \n\nrequired for entry. In addition, serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, presence of a new SEGA \n\nlesion ≥1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus was required for entry. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology \n\nreview. The analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptics at randomisation \n\n(yes/no). \n\n \n\nKey secondary endpoints in hierarchal order of testing included the absolute change in frequency of \n\ntotal seizure events per 24-hour EEG from baseline to week 24, time to SEGA progression, and skin \n\nlesion response rate. \n\n \n\nA total of 117 patients were randomised, 78 to Votubia and 39 to placebo. The two treatment arms \n\nwere generally well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics and \n\nhistory of prior anti-SEGA therapies. In the total population, 57.3% of patients were male and 93.2% \n\nwere Caucasian. The median age for the total population was 9.5 years (age range for the Votubia arm: \n\n1.0 to 23.9; age range for the placebo arm: 0.8 to 26.6), 69.2% of the patients were aged 3 to <18 years \n\nand 17.1% were <3 years at enrolment. \n\n \n\nOf the enrolled patients, 79.5% had bilateral SEGAs, 42.7% had ≥2 target SEGA lesions, 25.6% had \n\ninferior growth, 9.4% had evidence of deep parenchymal invasion, 6.8% had radiographic evidence of \n\nhydrocephalus, and 6.8% had undergone prior SEGA-related surgery. 94.0% had skin lesions at \n\nbaseline and 37.6% had target renal angiomyolipoma lesions (at least one angiomyolipoma ≥1 cm in \n\nlongest diameter). \n\n \n\nThe median duration of blinded study treatment was 9.6 months (range: 5.5 to 18.1) for patients \n\nreceiving Votubia and 8.3 months (range: 3.2 to 18.3) for those receiving placebo. \n\n \n\nResults showed that Votubia was superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of best overall SEGA \n\nresponse (p<0.0001). Response rates were 34.6% (95% CI: 24.2, 46.2) for the Votubia arm compared \n\nwith 0% (95% CI: 0.0, 9.0) for the placebo arm (Table 7). In addition, all 8 patients on the Votubia \n\narm who had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus at baseline had a decrease in ventricular volume. \n\n \n\nPatients initially treated with placebo were allowed to cross over to everolimus at the time of SEGA \n\nprogression and upon recognition that treatment with everolimus was superior to treatment with \n\nplacebo. All patients receiving at least one dose of everolimus were followed until medicinal product \n\ndiscontinuation or study completion. At the time of the final analysis, the median duration of exposure \n\namong all such patients was 204.9 weeks (range: 8.1 to 253.7). The best overall SEGA response rate \n\nhad increased to 57.7% (95% CI: 47.9, 67.0) at the final analysis. \n\n \n\nNo patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the entire course of the study. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nTable 7 EXIST-1 – SEGA response \n\n \n\n Primary analysis3  Final analysis4 \n\n Votubia Placebo p-value Votubia \n\n N=78 N=39  N=111 \n\n SEGA response rate1,2 - (%) 34.6 0 <0.0001 57.7 \n\n 95% CI 24.2, 46.2 0.0, 9.0  47.9, 67.0 \n\nBest overall SEGA response - (%)     \n\n Response 34.6 0  57.7 \n\n Stable disease 62.8 92.3  39.6 \n\n Progression 0 7.7  0 \n\n Not evaluable 2.6 0  2.7 \n1 according to independent central radiology review \n2 SEGA responses were confirmed with a repeat scan.

Sustained reductions were evident at week 24, 41.9% (31/74) of patients \n\nhad ≥50% reductions and 78.4% (58/74) of patients had ≥30% reductions in SEGA volume. \n\n \n\nIn the everolimus treated population (N=111) of the study, including patients who crossed over from \n\nthe placebo group, tumour response, starting as early as after 12 weeks on everolimus, was sustained \n\nat later time points. The proportion of patients achieving at least 50% reductions in SEGA volume was \n\n45.9% (45/98) and 62.1% (41/66) at weeks 96 and 192 after start of everolimus treatment. Similarly, \n\nthe proportion of patients achieving at least 30% reductions in SEGA volume was 71.4% (70/98) and \n\n77.3% (51/66) at weeks 96 and 192 after start of everolimus treatment. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the first key secondary endpoint, change in seizure frequency, was inconclusive; thus, \n\ndespite the fact that positive results were observed for the two subsequent secondary endpoints (time \n\nto SEGA progression and skin lesion response rate), they could not be declared formally statistically \n\nsignificant. \n\n \n\nMedian time to SEGA progression based on central radiology review was not reached in either \n\ntreatment arm. Progressions were only observed in the placebo arm (15.4%; p=0.0002). Estimated \n\nprogression-free rates at 6 months were 100% for the Votubia arm and 85.7% for the placebo arm. The \n\nlong-term follow-up of patients randomised to everolimus and patients randomised to placebo who \n\nthereafter crossed over to everolimus demonstrated durable responses. \n\n \n\nAt the time of the primary analysis, Votubia demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in skin \n\nlesion response (p=0.0004), with response rates of 41.7% (95% CI: 30.2, 53.9) for the Votubia arm \n\nand 10.5% (95% CI: 2.9, 24.8) for the placebo arm. At the final analysis, the skin lesion response rate \n\nincreased to 58.1% (95% CI: 48.1, 67.7). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPhase II study in patients with SEGA \n\nA prospective, open-label, single-arm phase II study (Study CRAD001C2485) was conducted to \n\nevaluate the safety and efficacy of Votubia in patients with SEGA. Radiological evidence of serial \n\nSEGA growth was required for entry. \n\n \n\nChange in SEGA volume during the core 6-month treatment phase, as assessed via an independent \n\ncentral radiology review, was the primary efficacy endpoint. After the core treatment phase, patients \n\ncould be enrolled into an extension phase where SEGA volume was assessed every 6 months. \n\n \n\nIn total, 28 patients received treatment with Votubia; median age was 11 years (range 3 to 34), 61% \n\nmale, 86% Caucasian. Thirteen patients (46%) had a secondary smaller SEGA, including 12 in the \n\ncontralateral ventricle. \n\n \n\nPrimary SEGA volume was reduced at month 6 compared to baseline (p<0.001 [see Table 8]). No \n\npatient developed new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure, and none \n\nrequired surgical resection or other therapy for SEGA. \n\n \n\nTable 8 Change in primary SEGA volume over time \n\n \n\nSEGA \n\nvolume \n\n(cm3) \n\nIndependent central review \n\n Baseline \n\nn=28 \n\nMonth 6 \n\nn=27 \n\nMonth 12 \n\nn=26 \n\nMonth 24 \n\nn=24 \n\nMonth 36 \n\nn=23 \n\nMonth 48 \n\nn=24 \n\nMonth 60 \n\nn=23 \n\nPrimary tumour volume \n\nMean \n\n(standard \n\ndeviation) \n\n2.45 \n\n(2.813) \n\n1.33 \n\n(1.497) \n\n1.26 \n\n(1.526) \n\n1.19 \n\n(1.042) \n\n1.26 \n\n(1.298) \n\n1.16 \n\n(0.961) \n\n1.24 \n\n(0.959) \n\nMedian 1.74 0.93 0.84 0.94 1.12 1.02 1.17 \n\n Range 0.49 - 14.\n\n23 \n\n0.31 - 7.9\n\n8 \n\n0.29 - 8.1\n\n8 \n\n0.20 - 4.6\n\n3 \n\n0.22 - 6.5\n\n2 \n\n0.18 - 4.1\n\n9 \n\n0.21 - 4.3\n\n9 \n\nReduction from baseline \n\nMean \n\n(standard \n\ndeviation) \n\n 1.19 \n\n(1.433) \n\n1.07 \n\n(1.276) \n\n1.25 \n\n(1.994) \n\n1.41 \n\n(1.814) \n\n1.43 \n\n(2.267) \n\n1.44 \n\n(2.230) \n\nMedian  0.83 0.85 0.71 0.71 0.83 0.50 \n\n Range  0.06 - 6.2\n\n5 \n\n0.02 - 6.0\n\n5 \n\n-0.55 - 9.6\n\n0 \n\n0.15 - 7.7\n\n1 \n\n0.00 - 10.\n\n96 \n\n-0.74 - 9.8\n\n4 \n\nPercentage reduction from baseline, n (%) \n\n ≥50%  9 (33.3) 9 (34.6) 12 (50.0) 10 (43.5) 14 (58.3) 12 (52.2) \n\n ≥30%  21 (77.8) 20 (76.9) 19 (79.2) 18 (78.3) 19 (79.2) 14 (60.9) \n\n >0%  27 \n\n(100.0) \n\n26 \n\n(100.0) \n\n23 \n\n(95.8) \n\n23 \n\n(100.0) \n\n23 \n\n(95.8) \n\n21 \n\n(91.3) \n\n No \n\nchange \n\n 0 0 0 0 1 (4.2) 0 \n\n Increase  0 0 1 (4.2) 0 0 2 (8.7) \n\n \n\nThe robustness and consistency of the primary analysis were supported by the: \n\n change in primary SEGA volume as per local investigator assessment (p<0.001), with 75.0% \nand 39.3% of patients experiencing reductions of ≥30% and ≥50%, respectively \n\n change in total SEGA volume as per independent central review (p<0.001) or local investigator \nassessment (p<0.001). \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nOne patient met the pre-specified criteria for treatment success (>75% reduction in SEGA volume) \n\nand was temporarily taken off trial therapy; however, SEGA re-growth was evident at the next \n\nassessment at 4.5 months and treatment was restarted. \n\n \n\nLong-term follow-up to a median duration of 67.8 months (range: 4.7 to 83.2) demonstrated sustained \n\nefficacy. \n\n \n\nOther studies \n\nStomatitis is the most commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with Votubia (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). In a post-marketing single-arm study in postmenopausal women with advanced \n\nbreast cancer (N=92), topical treatment with dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml alcohol-free oral solution \n\nwas administered as a mouthwash (4 times daily for the initial 8 weeks of treatment) to patients at the \n\ntime of initiating treatment with Afinitor (everolimus, 10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) to \n\nreduce the incidence and severity of stomatitis. The incidence of Grade ≥2 stomatitis at 8 weeks was \n\n2.4% (n=2/85 evaluable patients) which was lower than historically reported. The incidence of \n\nGrade 1 stomatitis was 18.8% (n=16/85) and no cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. The \n\noverall safety profile in this study was consistent with that established for everolimus in the oncology \n\nand TSC settings, with the exception of a slightly increased frequency of oral candidiasis which was \n\nreported in 2.2% (n=2/92) of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVotubia in all subsets of the paediatric population in angiomyolipoma (see section 4.2 for information \n\non paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nVotubia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in refractory epilepsy associated with TSC \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nIn patients with advanced solid tumours, peak everolimus concentrations (Cmax) are reached at a \n\nmedian time of 1 hour after daily administration of 5 and 10 mg everolimus under fasting conditions \n\nor with a light fat-free snack. Cmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. Everolimus is a substrate \n\nand moderate inhibitor of PgP. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nIn healthy subjects, high fat meals reduced systemic exposure to Votubia 10 mg tablets (as measured \n\nby AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration Cmax by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by \n\n32% and Cmax by 42%. \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects taking a single 9 mg dose (3 x 3 mg) of Votubia dispersible tablets in suspension, \n\nhigh fat meals reduced AUC by 11.7% and the peak blood concentration Cmax by 59.8%. Light fat \n\nmeals reduced AUC by 29.5% and Cmax by 50.2%. \n\n \n\nFood, however, had no apparent effect on the post absorption phase concentration-time profile \n\n24 hours post-dose of either dosage form. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n54 \n\nRelative bioavailability/bioequivalence \n\nIn a relative bioavailability study, AUC0-inf of 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets when administered as \n\nsuspension in water was equivalent to 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets administered as intact tablets, and \n\nCmax of 5 x 1 mg everolimus tablets in suspension was 72% of 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets. \n\n \n\nIn a bioequivalence study, AUC0-inf of the 5 mg dispersible tablet when administered as suspension in \n\nwater was equivalent to 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets, and Cmax of the 5 mg dispersible tablet in \n\nsuspension was 64% of 5 x 1 mg intact everolimus tablets. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to \n\n5,000 ng/ml, is 17% to 73%. Approximately 20% of the everolimus concentration in whole blood is \n\nconfined to plasma of cancer patients given Votubia 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is \n\napproximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In \n\npatients with advanced solid tumours, Vd was 191 l for the apparent central compartment and 517 l for \n\nthe apparent peripheral compartment. \n\n \n\nNonclinical studies in rats indicate: \n\n A rapid uptake of everolimus in the brain followed by a slow efflux. \n\n The radioactive metabolites of [3H]everolimus do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier. \n\n A dose-dependent brain penetration of everolimus, which is consistent with the hypothesis of \nsaturation of an efflux pump present in the brain capillary endothelial cells. \n\n The co-administration of the PgP inhibitor, cyclosporine, enhances the exposure of everolimus in \nthe brain cortex, which is consistent with the inhibition of PgP at the blood-brain barrier. \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the distribution of everolimus in the human brain. Non-clinical studies in \n\nrats demonstrated distribution into the brain following administration by both the intravenous and oral \n\nroutes. \n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main \n\ncirculating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in \n\nhuman blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, \n\nand a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal \n\nspecies used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus \n\nitself. Hence, everolimus is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacological \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMean CL/F of everolimus after 10 mg daily dose in patients with advanced solid tumours was 24.5 l/h. \n\nThe mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. \n\n \n\nNo specific excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; however, data are available \n\nfrom the studies in transplant patients. Following the administration of a single dose of radiolabelled \n\neverolimus in conjunction with ciclosporin, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the faeces, \n\nwhile 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or faeces. \n\n \n\nSteady-state pharmacokinetics \n\n \n\nAfter administration of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumours, steady-state AUC0-τ was \n\ndose-proportional over the range of 5 to 10 mg daily dose. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks. \n\nCmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. tmax occurs at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. There was a \n\nsignificant correlation between AUC0-τ and pre-dose trough concentration at steady-state. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Votubia were evaluated in two single oral dose \n\nstudies of Votubia tablets in 8 and 34 adult subjects with impaired hepatic function relative to subjects \n\nwith normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nIn the first study, the average AUC of everolimus in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh B) was twice that found in 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nIn the second study of 34 subjects with different impaired hepatic function compared to normal \n\nsubjects, there was a 1.6-fold, 3.3-fold and 3.6-fold increase in exposure (i.e. AUC0-inf) for subjects \n\nwith mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nSimulations of multiple dose pharmacokinetics support the dosing recommendations in subjects with \n\nhepatic impairment based on their Child-Pugh status. \n\n \n\nBased on the results of the two studies, dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 patients with advanced solid tumours, no significant \n\ninfluence of creatinine clearance (25-178 ml/min) was detected on CL/F of everolimus. Post-transplant \n\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance range 11-107 ml/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\neverolimus in transplant patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn patients with SEGA, everolimus Cmin was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range \n\nfrom 1.35 mg/m2 to 14.4 mg/m2. \n\n \n\nIn patients with SEGA, the geometric mean Cmin values normalised to mg/m2 dose in patients aged \n\n<10 years and 10-18 years were lower by 54% and 40%, respectively, than those observed in adults \n\n(>18 years of age), suggesting that everolimus clearance was higher in younger patients. Limited data \n\nin patients <3 years of age (n=13) indicate that BSA-normalised clearance is about two-fold higher in \n\npatients with low BSA (BSA of 0.556 m2) than in adults. Therefore it is assumed that steady-state \n\ncould be reached earlier in patients <3 years of age (see section 4.2 for dosing recommendations). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of everolimus have not been studied in patients younger than 1 year of age. It is \n\nreported, however, that CYP3A4 activity is reduced at birth and increases during the first year of life, \n\nwhich could affect the clearance in this patient population. \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis including 111 patients with SEGA who ranged from 1.0 to \n\n27.4 years (including 18 patients 1 to less than 3 years of age with BSA 0.42 m2 to 0.74 m2) showed \n\nthat BSA-normalised clearance is in general higher in younger patients. Population pharmacokinetic \n\nmodel simulations showed that a starting dose of 7 mg/m2 would be necessary to attain Cmin within the \n\n5 to 15 ng/ml range in patients younger than 3 years of age. A higher starting dose of 7 mg/m2 is \n\ntherefore recommended for patients 1 to less than 3 years of age with SEGA (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn patients with TSC and refractory seizures receiving Votubia dispersible tablets, a trend was \n\nobserved toward lower Cmin normalised to dose (as mg/m2) in younger patients. Median Cmin \n\nnormalised to mg/m2 dose was lower for the younger age groups, indicating that everolimus clearance \n\n(normalised to BSA) was higher in younger patients. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in cancer patients, no significant influence of age \n\n(27-85 years) on oral clearance of everolimus was detected. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nEthnicity \n\nOral clearance (CL/F) is similar in Japanese and Caucasian cancer patients with similar liver \n\nfunctions. Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% \n\nhigher in black transplant patients. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n\n \n\nIn patients with TSC and refractory seizures, a conditional logistic regression analysis based on the \n\ncore phase of Study CRAD001M2304 to estimate the probability of seizure response versus Time \n\nNormalised (TN)-Cmin stratified by age sub-group, indicated that a 2-fold increase in TN-Cmin was \n\nassociated with a 2.172-fold increase (95% CI: 1.339, 3.524) in the odds for a seizure response over \n\nthe observed TN-Cmin ranges of 0.97 ng/ml to 16.40 ng/ml. Baseline seizure frequency was a \n\nsignificant factor in the seizure response (with an odds ratio of 0.978 [95% CI: 0.959, 0.998]). This \n\noutcome was consistent with the results of a linear regression model predicting the log of absolute \n\nseizure frequency during the maintenance period of the core phase, which indicated that for a 2-fold \n\nincrease in TN-Cmin there was a statistically significant 28% reduction (95% CI: 12%, 42%) in \n\nabsolute seizure frequency. Baseline seizure frequency and TN-Cmin were both significant factors \n\n(α=0.05) in predicting the absolute seizure frequency in the linear regression model. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe non-clinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipigs, monkeys and \n\nrabbits. The major target organs were male and female reproductive systems (testicular tubular \n\ndegeneration, reduced sperm content in epididymides and uterine atrophy) in several species; lungs \n\n(increased alveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; pancreas (degranulation and vacuolation of \n\nexocrine cells in monkeys and minipigs, respectively, and degeneration of islet cells in monkeys), and \n\neyes (lenticular anterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney changes were seen in the rat \n\n(exacerbation of age-related lipofuscin in tubular epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse \n\n(exacerbation of background lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys or \n\nminipigs. \n\n \n\nEverolimus appeared to spontaneously exacerbate background diseases (chronic myocarditis in rats, \n\ncoxsackie virus infection of plasma and heart in monkeys, coccidian infestation of the gastrointestinal \n\ntract in minipigs, skin lesions in mice and monkeys). These findings were generally observed at \n\nsystemic exposure levels within the range of therapeutic exposure or above, with the exception of the \n\nfindings in rats, which occurred below therapeutic exposure due to a high tissue distribution. \n\n \n\nIn a male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm \n\nmotility, sperm head count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished at 5 mg/kg, which is \n\nwithin the range of therapeutic exposure and which caused a reduction in male fertility. There was \n\nevidence of reversibility. \n\n \n\nIn animal reproductive studies female fertility was not affected. However, oral doses of everolimus in \n\nfemale rats at ≥ 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% of the AUC0-24h in patients receiving the 10 mg daily \n\ndose) resulted in increases in pre-implantation loss. \n\n \n\nEverolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the foetus. In rats, everolimus caused \n\nembryo/foetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the therapeutic level. This was manifested as \n\nmortality and reduced foetal weight. The incidence of skeletal variations and malformations (e.g. \n\nsternal cleft) was increased at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg. In rabbits, embryotoxicity was evident in an increase \n\nin late resorptions. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nIn juvenile rat toxicity studies, systemic toxicity included decreased body weight gain, food \n\nconsumption, and delayed attainment of some developmental landmarks, with full or partial recovery \n\nafter cessation of dosing. With the possible exception of the rat-specific lens finding (where young \n\nanimals appeared to be more susceptible), it appears that there is no significant difference in the \n\nsensitivity of juvenile animals to the adverse reactions of everolimus as compared to adult animals. \n\nToxicity study with juvenile monkeys did not show any relevant toxicity. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of clastogenic or \n\nmutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate any oncogenic \n\npotential in mice and rats up to the highest doses, corresponding respectively to 4.3 and 0.2 times the \n\nestimated clinical exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Votubia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nVotubia is an anti-tumour medicine which can block certain cells in the body from growing. It \n\ncontains an active substance called everolimus which may reduce the size of kidney tumours called \n\nrenal angiomyolipomas and brain tumours called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA). \n\nThese tumours are caused by a genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). \n\n \n\nVotubia tablets are used to treat: \n\n TSC with angiomyolipoma of the kidney in adults who do not require immediate surgery. \n\n SEGA associated with TSC in adults and children for whom surgery is not appropriate. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Votubia \n\n \n\nIf you are being treated for TSC with angiomyolipoma of the kidney, Votubia will only be prescribed \n\nfor you by a doctor with experience in treating patients with TSC. \n\n \n\nIf you are being treated for SEGA associated with TSC, Votubia will only be prescribed by a doctor \n\nwith experience in treating patients with SEGA and with access to blood tests which will measure how \n\nmuch Votubia is in your blood. \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. If you have any questions about Votubia or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nDo not take Votubia \n\n if you are allergic to everolimus, to related substances such as sirolimus or temsirolimus, or to \nany of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you had allergic reactions before, please ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Votubia: \n\n if you have any problems with your liver or if you have ever had any disease which may have \naffected your liver. If this is the case, your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of \n\nVotubia or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently. \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). Votubia may increase blood sugar \nlevels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in the need for insulin and/or oral \n\nantidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased \n\nfrequency of urination. \n\n if you need to receive a vaccine while taking Votubia as vaccination may be less effective. For \nchildren with SEGA, it is important to have a discussion with the doctor about the childhood \n\nvaccination program before treatment with Votubia. \n\n if you have high cholesterol. Votubia may elevate cholesterol and/or other blood fats. \n\n if you have had recent major surgery, or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery. \nVotubia may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. \n\n if you have an infection. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Votubia. \n\n if you have previously had hepatitis B, because this may occur again during treatment with \nVotubia (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \n\n \n\nVotubia may also: \n\n cause mouth sores (oral ulcerations). \n\n weaken your immune system. Therefore, you may be at risk of getting an infection while you \nare taking Votubia. If you have fever or other signs of an infection, consult with your doctor. \n\nSome infections may be severe and may have fatal consequences in adults and children. \n\n impact your kidney function. Therefore, your doctor will monitor your kidney function while \nyou are taking Votubia. \n\n cause shortness of breath, cough and fever (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. \n\n \n\nYou will have blood tests before and periodically during treatment. These will check the amount of \n\nblood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in your body to see if Votubia is having an \n\nunwanted effect on these cells. Blood tests will also be carried out to check your kidney function \n\n(levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen or urinary protein), liver function (level of transaminases) \n\nand your blood sugar and lipid levels. This is because these can also be affected by Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf you receive Votubia for the treatment of SEGA associated with TSC, regular blood tests are also \n\nnecessary to measure how much Votubia is in your blood since this will help your doctor decide how \n\nmuch Votubia you need to take. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nVotubia can be used in children and adolescents SEGA associated with TSC. \n\n \n\nVotubia is not to be used in children or adolescents with TSC who have angiomyolipoma of the \n\nkidney in the absence of SEGA, as it has not been studied in such patients. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Votubia \nVotubia may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are taking other medicines at the same \n\ntime as Votubia, your doctor may need to change the dose of Votubia or the other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n88 \n\nThe following may increase the risk of side effects with Votubia: \n\n ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole and other antifungals used to treat \nfungal infections. \n\n clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n ritonavir, and other medicines used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n verapamil or diltiazem, used to treat heart conditions or high blood pressure. \n\n dronedarone, a medicine used to help regulate your heart beat. \n\n ciclosporin, a medicine used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants. \n\n imatinib, used to inhibit the growth of abnormal cells. \n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as ramipril) used to treat high blood \npressure or other cardiovascular problems. \n\n \n\nThe following may reduce the effectiveness of Votubia: \n\n rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n\n efavirenz or nevirapine, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression and other \nconditions. \n\n dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of conditions including \ninflammatory or immune problems. \n\n phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or fits. \n \n\nAll medicines listed above should be avoided during your treatment with Votubia. If you are taking \n\nany of them, your doctor may switch you to a different medicine, or may change your dose of Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking an anti-seizure medicine, a change in the dose of the anti-seizure medicine (increase \n\nor decrease) may make a change in the Votubia dose necessary. Your doctor will decide this. If the \n\ndose of your anti-seizure medicine changes, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nVotubia with food and drink \n\nAvoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are on Votubia. It may increase the amount of Votubia \n\nin the blood, possibly to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nPregnancy \n\nVotubia could harm an unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if \n\nyou are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. \n\n \n\nWomen who could potentially become pregnant must use highly effective contraception during \n\ntreatment, and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment. If, despite these measures, you think you may \n\nhave become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before taking any more Votubia. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nVotubia could harm a breast-fed baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks \n\nafter the last dose of Votubia. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nVotubia may affect male and female fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to have children. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you feel unusually tired (fatigue is a common side effect), take special care when driving or using \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\nVotubia contains lactose \n\nVotubia contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n3. How to take Votubia \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Votubia exists as tablets \n\nand dispersible tablets. Consistently take only the tablets or only the dispersible tablets, and never a \n\ncombination of both. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Votubia to take \n\nIf you receive Votubia for the treatment of TSC with angiomyolipoma of the kidney, the usual dose is \n\n10 mg, to be taken once daily. \n\n \n\nA higher or lower dose may be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment \n\nneeds, for example if you have problems with your liver or if you are taking certain other medicines in \n\naddition to Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf you receive Votubia for the treatment of TSC with SEGA, your doctor will determine the dose of \n\nVotubia you need to take depending on: \n\n your age \n\n your body size \n\n the health of your liver \n\n other medicines you are taking. \n \n\nYou will have blood tests during treatment with Votubia. This is to measure the amount of Votubia in \n\nyour blood and find the best daily dose for you. \n\n \n\nIf you experience certain side effects (see section 4) while you are taking Votubia, your doctor may \n\nlower your dose or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently. \n\n \n\nHow to take this medicine \n\n Take Votubia tablets once a day. \n\n Take them at the same time every day. \n\n You can take them either with or without food, but you need to do this in the same way each \nday. \n\n \n\nSwallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. If you are taking \n\nVotubia tablets for the treatment of TSC with SEGA and if you are unable to swallow the tablets, you \n\ncan stir them into a glass of water: \n\n Put the required number of tablets into a glass of water (approximately 30 ml). \n\n Gently stir the contents of the glass until the tablets break apart (approximately 7 minutes) and \nthen drink the contents immediately. \n\n Refill the glass with the same amount of water (approximately 30 ml), gently stir the remaining \ncontent and drink the whole amount to make sure that you get the full dose of Votubia tablets. \n\n If necessary, drink additional water to wash out any residues in your mouth. \n \n\nSpecial information for caregivers \n\nCaregivers are advised to avoid contact with suspensions of Votubia tablets. Wash hands thoroughly \n\nbefore and after preparation of the suspension. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Votubia than you should \n\n If you have taken too much Votubia, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, see a \ndoctor or go to a hospital immediately. Urgent treatment may be necessary. \n\n Take the carton and this leaflet, so that the doctor knows what has been taken. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n90 \n\nIf you forget to take Votubia \n\nIf you miss a dose, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for the \n\nforgotten tablets. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Votubia \n\nDo not stop taking Votubia tablets unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSTOP taking Votubia and seek medical help immediately if you or your

What Votubia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nVotubia dispersible tablets contain an active substance called everolimus. It is used to treat children \n\naged 2 years and above and adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation \n\n(epilepsy) associated with a genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and which are \n\nnot controlled by other antiepileptic medicines. Partial seizures start by only affecting one side of the \n\nbrain but can spread and extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (called a “secondary \n\ngeneralisation”). Votubia dispersible tablets are given together with other medicines for epilepsy. \n\n \n\nVotubia is also an anti-tumour medicine which can block certain cells in the body from growing. It \n\nmay reduce the size of brain tumours called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) which are \n\nalso caused by TSC. \n\n \n\nVotubia dispersible tablets are used to treat SEGA associated with TSC in adults and children for \n\nwhom surgery is not appropriate. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Votubia \n\n \n\nVotubia will only be prescribed by a doctor with experience in treating patients with SEGA or seizures \n\nand with access to blood tests which will measure how much Votubia is in your blood. \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained \n\nin this leaflet. If you have any questions about Votubia or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nDo not take Votubia \n\n if you are allergic to everolimus, to related substances such as sirolimus or temsirolimus, or to \nany of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you had allergic reactions before, please ask your doctor for advice. \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Votubia: \n\n if you have any problems with your liver or if you have ever had any disease which may have \naffected your liver. If this is the case, your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of \n\nVotubia or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently. \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). Votubia may increase blood sugar \nlevels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in the need for insulin and/or oral \n\nantidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased \n\nfrequency of urination. \n\n if you need to receive a vaccine while taking Votubia as vaccination may be less effective. For \nchildren with SEGA or seizures, it is important to have a discussion with the doctor about the \n\nchildhood vaccination program before treatment with Votubia. \n\n if you have high cholesterol. Votubia may elevate cholesterol and/or other blood fats. \n\n if you have had recent major surgery, or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery. \nVotubia may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. \n\n if you have an infection. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Votubia. \n\n if you have previously had hepatitis B, because this may occur again during treatment with \nVotubia (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \n\n \n\nVotubia may also: \n\n cause mouth sores (oral ulcerations). \n\n cause mouth sores (oral ulcerations). \n\n weaken your immune system. Therefore, you may be at risk of getting an infection while you \nare taking Votubia. If you have fever or other signs of an infection, consult with your doctor. \n\nSome infections may be severe and may have fatal consequences in adults and children. \n\n impact your kidney function. Therefore, your doctor will monitor your kidney function while \nyou are taking Votubia. \n\n cause shortness of breath, cough and fever (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. \n\n \n\nYou will have blood tests before and periodically during treatment. These will check the amount of \n\nblood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in your body to see if Votubia is having an \n\nunwanted effect on these cells. Blood tests will also be carried out to check your kidney function \n\n(levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen or urinary protein), liver function (level of transaminases) \n\nand your blood sugar and lipid levels. This is because these can also be affected by Votubia. \n\n \n\nRegular blood tests are also necessary to measure how much Votubia is in your blood since this will \n\nhelp your doctor decide how much Votubia you need to take. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nVotubia can be used in children and adolescents with SEGA associated with TSC. \n\n \n\nVotubia is not to be used in children below the age of 2 years with TSC and seizures. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Votubia \nVotubia may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are taking other medicines at the same \n\ntime as Votubia, your doctor may need to change the dose of Votubia or the other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n98 \n\nThe following may increase the risk of side effects with Votubia: \n\n ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole and other antifungals used to treat \nfungal infections. \n\n clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n ritonavir, and other medicines used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n verapamil or diltiazem, used to treat heart conditions or high blood pressure. \n\n dronedarone, a medicine used to help regulate your heart beat. \n\n ciclosporin, a medicine used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants. \n\n imatinib, used to inhibit the growth of abnormal cells. \n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as ramipril) used to treat high blood \npressure or other cardiovascular problems. \n\n \n\nThe following may reduce the effectiveness of Votubia: \n\n rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n\n efavirenz or nevirapine, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression and other \nconditions. \n\n dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of conditions including \ninflammatory or immune problems. \n\n phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or fits. \n \n\nAll medicines listed above should be avoided during your treatment with Votubia. If you are taking \n\nany of them, your doctor may switch you to a different medicine, or may change your dose of Votubia. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking an anti-seizure medicine, a change in the dose of the anti-seizure medicine (increase \n\nor decrease) may make a change in the Votubia dose necessary. Your doctor will decide this. If the \n\ndose of your anti-seizure medicine changes, please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are following a specific diet to reduce the frequency of your seizures, please inform your doctor \n\nbefore taking Votubia. \n\n \n\nVotubia with food and drink \n\nAvoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are on Votubia. It may increase the amount of Votubia \n\nin the blood, possibly to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nPregnancy \n\nVotubia could harm an unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if \n\nyou are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. \n\n \n\nWomen who could potentially become pregnant must use highly effective contraception during \n\ntreatment, and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment. If, despite these measures, you think you may \n\nhave become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before taking any more Votubia. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nVotubia could harm a breast-fed baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks \n\nafter the last dose of Votubia. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nVotubia may affect male and female fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to have children. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you feel unusually tired (fatigue is a common side effect), take special care when driving or using \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\nVotubia contains lactose \n\nVotubia contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Votubia \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Votubia exists as tablets \n\nand dispersible tablets.

This will look like a cloudy liquid (known as an oral suspension). \n\n \n\nUse an oral syringe or a small glass for preparing and taking the Votubia suspension only – do \n\nnot use it for anything else. \n\n \n\nImportant information: \n\n \n\nTake Votubia dispersible tablets as a suspension only. \n\n \n\nThese instructions are for taking a dose between 1 mg and 10 mg. \n\n The most you can take at one time using the oral syringe or small glass is 10 mg, using a \nmaximum of 5 dispersible tablets. \n\n If you need to take a higher dose or need to use more than 5 dispersible tablets, split the dose \nand repeat the steps using the same oral syringe or small glass. \n\n Ask your doctor or pharmacist about how to split the dose if you are not sure. \n \n\nCaregivers should try to avoid skin contact with the oral suspension. Keep the medicine out of the \n\nreach of children. \n\n \n\nOnly use water (drinkable tap water or non-sparkling bottled water) to prepare the oral suspension. Do \n\nnot use juice or any other liquids. \n\n \n\nThe patient must drink the suspension immediately after it is prepared. If the patient does not drink it \n\nwithin 30 minutes if an oral syringe has been used or within 60 minutes if a small glass has been used, \n\nthrow it away and prepare a new suspension. \n\n \n\nInstructions for caregivers preparing the suspension using an oral syringe: \n\n \n\nYou will need: \n\n The blister with Votubia dispersible tablets \n\n Scissors to open the blister \n\n 10 ml oral syringe with 1 ml increments (for single use): see figure below \n 2 clean glasses \n\n Approximately 30 ml of water \n \n\n \n \n\nPlunger \nBarrel \n\nVolume \n\nindicators \n\nTip \n\n\n\n107 \n\nGetting ready \n\n \n\n1. Wash and dry your hands. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Take the 10 ml oral syringe and pull out the plunger, \n\nremoving it completely from the barrel of the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAdding the dispersible tablets \n\n \n\n3. Use scissors to open the blister along the dotted line. Remove \n\nthe dispersible tablets from the blister. Place them into the \n\nbarrel of the oral syringe straight away. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n4. Re-insert the plunger into the barrel of the oral syringe. Push \n\nthe plunger in until it touches the dispersible tablets. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAdding water \n\n \n\n5. Fill a small glass with water (drinkable tap water or \n\nnon-sparkling bottled water). Put the tip of the syringe into \n\nthe water. Draw up about 5 ml of water by slowly pulling the \n\nplunger out until it is at the 5 ml mark on the syringe. \n\n \n\nNote: The amount of water in the oral syringe does not need \n\nto be exact but all the tablets should be covered. If any \n\ntablets get stuck in the dry upper part of the oral syringe, \n\ngently tap the oral syringe until they fall down into the water. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMixing the medicine \n\n \n\n6. Hold the oral syringe with the tip pointing up. Pull the \n\nplunger slowly down to draw in air until it is at the 9 ml \n\nmark on the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n7. Put the filled oral syringe in the clean, empty glass with the \n\ntip pointing up. Wait for 3 minutes – until the dispersible \n\ntablets have completely broken apart. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3 Min \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n8. Mix the medicine by slowly turning the oral syringe upside \n\ndown and back again five times just before using the dose. \n\nDo not shake it. Use the oral suspension immediately. If you \n\ndo not use it within 30 minutes, throw it away and prepare a \n\nnew suspension. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nRemoving air \n\n \n\n9. Hold the oral syringe with the tip pointing upwards. Push the \n\nplunger up slowly to remove most of the air (it is okay for a \n\nsmall amount of air to remain around the tip). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTaking the medicine \n\n \n\n10. Put the oral syringe into the patient’s mouth. Push the \n\nplunger in slowly to release the full contents of the oral \n\nsyringe. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n11. Carefully remove the oral syringe from the patient’s mouth. \n\n \n\n \n\nMaking sure all of the medicine has been taken \n\n \n\n12. Insert the tip of the oral syringe into the glass filled with \n\nwater. Draw up 5 ml of water by slowly pulling the plunger \n\nup. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n13. Hold the oral syringe with the tip pointing up. Pull the \n\nplunger slowly down to draw in air until it is at the 9 ml \n\nmark on the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n14. With the tip of the oral syringe pointing upwards, swirl the \n\nwater around to collect any medicine that is left inside. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n15. Hold the oral syringe with the tip pointing upward. Push the \n\nplunger up slowly to remove most of the air. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n5x \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n16. Put the oral syringe into the patient’s mouth. Push the \n\nplunger in slowly to release the full contents of the oral \n\nsyringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n17. Carefully remove the oral syringe from the patient’s mouth. \n\n \n\nIf the total prescribed dose is more than 10 mg or has to \n\nbe prepared using more than 5 dispersible tablets, repeat \n\nsteps 2 to 17 to finish giving the dose. \n\n \n\n \n\nCleaning up \n\n \n\n18. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away the oral syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19. Wash and dry your hands. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInstructions for patients or caregivers preparing the suspension using a small glass: \n\n \n\nYou will need: \n\n Blister with Votubia dispersible tablets \n\n Scissors to open the blister \n\n 1 small glass (maximum size 100 ml) \n\n 30 ml dose cup for measuring water \n\n Approximately 50 ml of water to prepare the suspension \n\n Spoon for stirring \n \n\nGetting ready \n\n \n\n1. Wash and dry your hands. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdding water \n\n \n\n2. Add about 25 ml of water to the 30 ml dose cup. The amount \n\nof water added does not need to be exact. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3. Pour the water from the dose cup into the small glass. \n\n \nAdding the dispersible tablets \n\n \n\n4. Use scissors to open the blister along the dotted line.
