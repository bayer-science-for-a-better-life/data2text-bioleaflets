NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXGEVA 120 mg solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 120 mg of denosumab in 1.7 mL of solution (70 mg/mL). \n \nDenosumab is a human monoclonal IgG2 antibody produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese \nhamster ovary cells) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effects \nEach 1.7 mL of solution contains 78 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution and may contain trace amounts of translucent to white \nproteinaceous particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression \nor surgery to bone) in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 5.1). \n \nTreatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is \nunresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nXGEVA should be administered under the responsibility of a healthcare professional. \n \nPosology \n \nSupplementation of at least 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily is required in all patients, \nunless hypercalcaemia is present (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients treated with XGEVA should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone \nThe recommended dose is 120 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks \ninto the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \n \nGiant cell tumour of bone \nThe recommended dose of XGEVA is 120 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once \nevery 4 weeks into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm with additional 120 mg doses on days 8 and 15 of \ntreatment of the first month of therapy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients in the phase II study who underwent complete resection of giant cell tumour of bone did \nreceive an additional 6 months of treatment following the surgery as per study protocol. \n \nPatients with giant cell tumour of bone should be evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether \nthey continue to benefit from treatment. In patients whose disease is controlled by XGEVA, the effect \nof interruption or cessation of treatment has not been evaluated, however limited data in these patients \ndoes not indicate a rebound effect upon cessation of treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4 for recommendations \nrelating to monitoring of calcium, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of denosumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly patients (age \u2265 65) \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of XGEVA have not been established in paediatric patients (age < 18) other \nthan skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with giant cell tumour of bone. \n \nXGEVA is not recommended in paediatric patients (age < 18) other than skeletally mature adolescents \n(aged 12-17 years) with giant cell tumour of bone (see section 4.4). \n \nTreatment of skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone that is unresectable or \nwhere surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity: the posology is the same as in adults. \n \nInhibition of RANK/RANK ligand (RANKL) in animal studies has been coupled to inhibition of bone \ngrowth and lack of tooth eruption, and these changes were partially reversible upon cessation of \nRANKL inhibition (see section 5.3). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nFor instructions for use, handling and disposal see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere, untreated hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nUnhealed lesions from dental or oral surgery. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCalcium and Vitamin D supplementation \n \nSupplementation with calcium and vitamin D is required in all patients unless hypercalcaemia is \npresent (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHypocalcaemia \n \nPre-existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with XGEVA. \nHypocalcaemia can occur at any time during therapy with XGEVA. Monitoring of calcium levels \nshould be conducted (i) prior to the initial dose of XGEVA, (ii) within two weeks after the initial dose, \n(iii) if suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur (see section 4.8 for symptoms). Additional \nmonitoring of calcium level should be considered during therapy in patients with risk factors for \nhypocalcaemia, or if otherwise indicated based on the clinical condition of the patient. \n \nPatients should be encouraged to report symptoms indicative of hypocalcaemia. If hypocalcaemia \noccurs while receiving XGEVA, additional calcium supplementation and additional monitoring may \nbe necessary. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including fatal cases) has been \nreported (see section 4.8), with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy, but can \noccur later. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis are at \ngreater risk of developing hypocalcaemia. The risk of developing hypocalcaemia and accompanying \nelevations in parathyroid hormone increases with increasing degree of renal impairment. Regular \nmonitoring of calcium levels is especially important in these patients. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n \nONJ has been reported commonly in patients receiving XGEVA (see section 4.8). \n \nThe start of treatment/new treatment course should be delayed in patients with unhealed open soft \ntissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with denosumab. \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ: \n\uf0b7 potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n\uf0b7 cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n\uf0b7 concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n\uf0b7 poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, pre-existing dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures (e.g. tooth extractions). \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with denosumab. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures \nshould be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to XGEVA \nadministration. \n \nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \ninterruption of XGEVA treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing \nrisk factors are mitigated where possible. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with denosumab. Possible risk factors \nfor osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk \nfactors such as infection or trauma. The possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \nshould be considered in patients receiving denosumab who present with ear symptoms including \nchronic ear infections. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \n \nAtypical femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving denosumab (see section 4.8). \nAtypical femoral fractures may occur with little or no trauma in the subtrochanteric and diaphyseal \nregions of the femur. Specific radiographic findings characterise these events. Atypical femoral \nfractures have also been reported in patients with certain co-morbid conditions (e.g. vitamin D \ndeficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophosphatasia) and with use of certain pharmaceutical agents (e.g. \nbisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors). These events have also occurred without \nantiresorptive therapy. Similar fractures reported in association with bisphosphonates are often \nbilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in denosumab-treated patients who \nhave sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Discontinuation of XGEVA therapy in patients suspected to \nhave an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient based on an \nindividual benefit-risk assessment. During denosumab treatment, patients should be advised to report \nnew or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Patients presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated \nfor an incomplete femoral fracture. \n \nHypercalcaemia following treatment discontinuation in patients with giant cell tumour of bone and in \npatients with growing skeletons \n \nClinically significant hypercalcaemia requiring hospitalisation and complicated by acute renal injury \nhas been reported in XGEVA-treated patients with giant cell tumour of bone weeks to months \nfollowing treatment discontinuation. \n \nAfter treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia, consider \nperiodic assessment of serum calcium and re-evaluate the patient\u2019s calcium and vitamin D \nsupplementation requirements (see section 4.8). \n \nXGEVA is not recommended in patients with growing skeletons (see section 4.2). Clinically \nsignificant hypercalcaemia has also been reported in this patient group weeks to months following \ntreatment discontinuation. \n \nOthers \n \nPatients being treated with XGEVA should not be treated concomitantly with other denosumab \ncontaining medicinal products (for osteoporosis indications). \n \nPatients being treated with XGEVA should not be treated concomitantly with bisphosphonates. \n \nMalignancy in giant cell tumour of bone or progression to metastatic disease is an infrequent event and \na known risk in patients with giant cell tumour of bone. Patients should be monitored for radiological \nsigns of malignancy, new radiolucency or osteolysis. Available clinical data does not suggest an \nincreased risk of malignancy in giant cell tumour of bone patients treated with XGEVA. \n \nWarnings for excipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIn clinical trials, XGEVA has been administered in combination with standard anti-cancer treatment \nand in subjects previously receiving bisphosphonates. There were no clinically-relevant alterations in \ntrough serum concentration and pharmacodynamics of denosumab (creatinine adjusted urinary \nN-telopeptide, uNTx/Cr) by concomitant chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy or by previous \nintravenous bisphosphonate exposure. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of denosumab in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nXGEVA is not recommended for use in pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential not \nusing contraception. Women should be advised not to become pregnant during and for at least \n5 months after treatment with XGEVA. Any effects of XGEVA are likely to be greater during the \nsecond and third trimesters of pregnancy since monoclonal antibodies are transported across the \nplacenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the \nthird trimester. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether denosumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Knockout mouse studies suggest absence of RANKL during pregnancy may interfere with \nmaturation of the mammary gland leading to impaired lactation post-partum (see section 5.3). A \ndecision must be made on whether to abstain from breast-feeding or to abstain from XGEVA therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the newborn/infant and the benefit of therapy for \nthe woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available on the effect of denosumab on human fertility. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXGEVA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nOverall safety profile is consistent in all approved indications for XGEVA. \n \nHypocalcaemia has very commonly been reported following XGEVA administration, mostly within \nthe first 2 weeks. Hypocalcaemia can be severe and symptomatic (see section 4.8 - description of \nselected adverse reactions). The decreases in serum calcium were generally appropriately managed by \ncalcium and vitamin D supplementation. The most common adverse reactions with XGEVA are \nmusculoskeletal pain. Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (see sections 4.4 and section 4.8 - description \nof selected adverse reactions) have been commonly observed in patients taking XGEVA. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions based on \nincidence rates in four phase III, two phase II clinical studies and post-marketing experience (see \ntable 1): very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data. Within each frequency grouping and system organ class, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1.

Hypocalcaemia was reported in 16.9% of patients treated with XGEVA and 12.4% of \npatients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 3 decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in \n1.4% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.6% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 4 \ndecrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 0.4% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.1% \nof patients treated with zoledronic acid. \n \nIn three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving \nbone, hypocalcaemia was reported in 9.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 5.0% of patients \ntreated with zoledronic acid. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nA grade 3 decrease in serum calcium levels was experienced in 2.5% of patients treated with XGEVA \nand 1.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. A grade 4 decrease in serum calcium levels was \nexperienced in 0.6% of patients treated with XGEVA and 0.2% of patients treated with zoledronic \nacid (see section 4.4). \n \nIn two phase II single-arm clinical trials in patients with giant cell tumour of bone, hypocalcaemia was \nreported in 5.7% of patients. None of the adverse events was considered serious. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (including fatal cases) has been \nreported, with most cases occurring in the first weeks of initiating therapy. Examples of clinical \nmanifestations of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia have included QT interval prolongation, tetany, \nseizures and altered mental status (including coma) (see section 4.4). Symptoms of hypocalcaemia in \nclinical studies included paraesthesias or muscle stiffness, twitching, spasms and muscle cramps. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \nIn clinical trials, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure; ONJ has also been \ndiagnosed after stopping treatment with XGEVA with the majority of cases occurring within 5 months \nafter the last dose. Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or \njaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental \nprocedure were excluded from the clinical trials. \n \nA higher incidence of ONJ among subjects treated with denosumab compared to zoledronic acid has \nbeen observed in SRE prevention clinical trials. The highest incidence of ONJ was observed in a \nphase III trial in patients with multiple myeloma. In the double-blind treatment phase of this trial, ONJ \nwas confirmed in 5.9% of patients treated with XGEVA (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1 -\n 52) and in 3.2% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. At the completion of the double-blind \ntreatment phase of this trial, the patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ in the XGEVA \ngroup (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1 - 52), was 2.0 per 100 patient-years during the first \nyear of treatment, 5.0 in the second year, and 4.5 thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 18.7 months \n(range: 1 - 44). \n \nIn the primary treatment phases of three phase III active-controlled clinical trials in patients with \nadvanced malignancies involving bone, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients treated with XGEVA \n(median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1 \u2013 40.5) and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. \nClinical characteristics of these cases were similar between treatment groups. Among subjects with \nconfirmed ONJ, most (81% in both treatment groups) had a history of tooth extraction, poor oral \nhygiene, and/or use of a dental appliance. Most subjects were receiving or had received chemotherapy. \n \nThe trials in patients with breast or prostate cancer included an XGEVA extension treatment phase \n(median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1 \u2013 67.2). ONJ was confirmed in 6.9% of patients \nwith breast cancer and prostate cancer during the extension treatment phase. \n \nThe patient-year adjusted overall incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1 per 100 patient-years during the \nfirst year of treatment, 3.7 in the second year and 4.6 thereafter. The median time to ONJ was \n20.6 months (range: 4 - 53). \n \nA non-randomised, retrospective, observational study in 2,877 patients with cancer treated with \nXGEVA or zoledronic acid in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway showed that 5-year incidence \nproportions of medically confirmed ONJ were 5.7% (95% CI: 4.4, 7.3; median follow up time of \n20 months [range 0.2-60]) in a cohort of patients receiving XGEVA and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.8, 2.3;  \nmedian follow up time of 13 months [range 0.1-60]) in a separate cohort of patients receiving \nzoledronic acid. Five-year incidence proportion of ONJ in patients switching from zoledronic acid to \nXGEVA was 6.6% (95% CI: 4.2, 10.0; median follow up time of 13 months [range 0.2-60]). \n \nIn a phase III trial in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which \nXGEVA is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted \n\n\n\n9 \n\nincidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1 per 100 patient-years during the first year of treatment, 3.0 in the \nsecond year, and 7.1 thereafter. \n \nIn a long-term phase II open-label clinical trial in patients with giant cell tumour of bone (Study 6, see \nsection 5.1), ONJ was confirmed in 6.8% of patients, including one adolescent (median number of \n34 doses; range 4 \u2013 116). At the completion of the trial, median time on trial including safety follow-\nup phase was 60.9 months (range: 0 \u2013 112.6). The patient-year adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ \nwas 1.5 per 100 patient-years overall (0.2 per 100 patient-years during the first year of treatment, 1.5 \nin the second year, 1.8 in the third year, 2.1 in the fourth year, 1.4 in the fifth year, and 2.2 thereafter). \nThe median time to ONJ was 41 months (range: 11 - 96). \n \nDrug related hypersensitivity reactions \nIn the post-marketing setting, events of hypersensitivity, including rare events of anaphylactic \nreactions, have been reported in patients receiving XGEVA. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nIn the clinical trial programme, atypical femoral fractures have been reported uncommonly in patients \ntreated with XGEVA and the risk increased with longer duration of treatment. Events have occurred \nduring treatment and up to 9 months after treatment was discontinued (see section 4.4). \n \nMusculoskeletal pain \nIn the post-marketing setting, musculoskeletal pain, including severe cases, has been reported in \npatients receiving XGEVA. In clinical trials, musculoskeletal pain was very common in both the \ndenosumab and zoledronic acid treatment groups. Musculoskeletal pain leading to discontinuation of \nstudy treatment was uncommon. \n \nNew primary malignancy \nIn the primary double blind treatment phases of four phase III active-controlled clinical trials in \npatients with advanced malignancies involving bone, new primary malignancy was reported in \n54/3691 (1.5%) of patients treated with XGEVA (median exposure of 13.8 months; range: 1.0\u201351.7) \nand 33/3688 (0.9%) of patients treated with zoledronic acid (median exposure of 12.9 months; range: \n1.0-50.8). \n \nThe cumulative incidence at one year was 1.1 % for denosumab and 0.6 % for zoledronic acid, \nrespectively. \n \nNo treatment-related pattern in individual cancers or cancer groupings was apparent. \n \nLichenoid drug eruptions \nLichenoid drug eruptions (e.g. lichen planus-like reactions), have been reported in patients in the post-\nmarketing setting. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nXGEVA was studied in an open-label trial that enrolled 28 skeletally mature adolescents with giant \ncell tumour of bone. Based on these limited data, the adverse event profile appeared to be similar to \nadults. \n \nClinically significant hypercalcaemia after treatment discontinuation has been reported in the \npost-marketing setting in paediatric patients (see section 4.4). \n \nOther special populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a clinical study of patients without advanced cancer with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis, there was a greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia in \nthe absence of calcium supplementation. The risk of developing hypocalcaemia during XGEVA \n\n\n\n10 \n\ntreatment is greater with increasing degree of renal impairment. In a clinical study in patients without \nadvanced cancer, 19% of patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) \nand 63% of patients receiving dialysis developed hypocalcaemia despite calcium supplementation. \nThe overall incidence of clinically significant hypocalcaemia was 9%. \n \nAccompanying increases in parathyroid hormone have also been observed in patients receiving \nXGEVA with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis. Monitoring of calcium levels and \nadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is especially important in patients with renal impairment \n(see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in clinical studies. XGEVA has been administered in clinical \nstudies using doses up to 180 mg every 4 weeks and 120 mg weekly for 3 weeks. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases \u2013 other drugs affecting bone \nstructure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRANKL exists as a transmembrane or soluble protein. RANKL is essential for the formation, function \nand survival of osteoclasts, the sole cell type responsible for bone resorption. Increased osteoclast \nactivity, stimulated by RANKL, is a key mediator of bone destruction in metastatic bone disease and \nmultiple myeloma. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with \nhigh affinity and specificity to RANKL, preventing the RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring \nand resulting in reduced osteoclast numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and \ncancer-induced bone destruction. \n \nGiant cell tumours of bone are characterised by neoplastic stromal cells expressing RANK ligand and \nosteoclast-like giant cells expressing RANK. In patients with giant cell tumour of bone, denosumab \nbinds to RANK ligand, significantly reducing or eliminating osteoclast-like giant cells. Consequently, \nosteolysis is reduced and proliferative tumour stroma is replaced with non-proliferative, differentiated, \ndensely woven new bone. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn phase II clinical studies of patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, subcutaneous (SC) \ndosing of XGEVA administered either every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 12 weeks resulted in a rapid \nreduction in markers of bone resorption (uNTx/Cr, serum CTx), with median reductions of \napproximately 80% for uNTx/Cr occurring within 1 week regardless of prior bisphosphonate therapy \nor baseline uNTx/Cr level. In phase III clinical trials of patients with advanced malignancies involving \nbone, median uNTx/Cr reductions of approximately 80% were maintained through 49 weeks of \nXGEVA treatment (120 mg every Q4W). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nImmunogenicity \n \nIn clinical studies, neutralising antibodies have not been observed for denosumab in advanced cancer \npatients or giant cell tumour of bone patients. Using a sensitive immunoassay < 1% of patients treated \nwith denosumab for up to 3 years tested positive for non neutralising binding antibodies with no \nevidence of altered pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or clinical response. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours \n \nEfficacy and safety of 120 mg XGEVA SC every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid (dose-adjusted for \nreduced renal function) IV every 4 weeks were compared in three randomised, double-blind, \nactive-controlled studies, in IV-bisphosphonate na\u00efve patients with advanced malignancies involving \nbone: adults with breast cancer (study 1), other solid tumours or multiple myeloma (study 2), and \ncastrate-resistant prostate cancer (study 3). Within these active-controlled clinical trials, safety was \nevaluated in 5,931 patients. Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active \ndental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive \ndental procedure, were not eligible for inclusion in these studies. The primary and secondary endpoints \nevaluated the occurrence of one or more skeletal related events (SREs). In studies demonstrating \nsuperiority of XGEVA to zoledronic acid, patients were offered open-label XGEVA in a pre-specified \n2-year extension treatment phase. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture \n(vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to \nbone, or spinal cord compression. \n \nXGEVA reduced the risk of developing a SRE, and developing multiple SREs (first and subsequent) \nin patients with bone metastases from solid tumours (see table 2). \n \nTable 2.

This study \ndid not control for prognostic factors and anti-neoplastic treatments. In a combined pre-specified \nanalysis from studies 1, 2 and 3, overall survival was similar between XGEVA and zoledronic acid \n(hazard ratio and 95% CI 0.99 [0.91, 1.07]). \n \nEffect on pain \n \nThe time to pain improvement (i.e. \u2265 2-point decrease from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score) was \nsimilar for denosumab and zoledronic acid in each study and the integrated analyses. In a post-hoc \nanalysis of the combined dataset, the median time to worsening pain (> 4-point worst pain score) in \npatients with mild or no pain at baseline was delayed for XGEVA compared to zoledronic acid \n(198 versus 143 days) (p = 0.0002). \n \nClinical efficacy in patients with multiple myeloma \n \nXGEVA was evaluated in an international, randomised (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled study \ncomparing XGEVA with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, study 4. \n \nIn this study, 1,718 multiple myeloma patients with at least one bone lesion were randomised to \nreceive 120 mg XGEVA subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously \n(IV) every 4 weeks (dose-adjusted for renal function). The primary outcome measure was \ndemonstration of non-inferiority of time to first on study skeletal related event (SRE) as compared to \nzoledronic acid. Secondary outcome measures included superiority of time to first SRE, superiority of \ntime to first and subsequent SRE, and overall survival. An SRE was defined as any of the following: \npathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of \nradioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. \n \nAcross both study arms, 54.5% of patients intended to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation, \n95.8% patients utilised/planned to utilise a novel anti-myeloma agent (novel therapies include \nbortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide) in first-line therapy, and 60.7% of patients had a previous \nSRE. The number of patients across both study arms with ISS stage I, stage II, and stage III at \ndiagnosis were 32.4%, 38.2%, and 29.3%, respectively. \n \nThe median number of doses administered was 16 for XGEVA and 15 for zoledronic acid. \n \nEfficacy results from study 4 are presented in figure 2 and table 3. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nFigure 2.

Patients received 120 mg XGEVA \nsubcutaneously every 4 weeks with a loading dose of 120 mg on days 8 and 15. Patients who \ndiscontinued XGEVA then entered the safety follow-up phase for a minimum of 60 months. \nRetreatment with XGEVA while in safety follow-up was allowed for subjects who initially \ndemonstrated a response to XGEVA (e.g. in the case of recurrent disease). \n \nStudy 5 enrolled 37 adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or recurrent giant cell \ntumour of bone. The main outcome measure of the trial was response rate, defined as either at least \n90% elimination of giant cells relative to baseline (or complete elimination of giant cells in cases \nwhere giant cells represent < 5% of tumour cells), or a lack of progression of the target lesion by \nradiographic measurements in cases where histopathology was not available. Of the 35 patients \nincluded in the efficacy analysis, 85.7% (95% CI: 69.7, 95.2) had a treatment response to XGEVA. All \n20 patients (100%) with histology assessments met response criteria. Of the remaining 15 patients, 10 \n(67%) radiographic measurements showed no progression of the target lesion. \n \nStudy 6 enrolled 535 adult or skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumour of bone. Of these \npatients, 28 were aged 12-17 years. Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts: cohort 1 included \npatients with surgically unsalvageable disease (e.g. sacral, spinal, or multiple lesions, including \npulmonary metastases); cohort 2 included patients with surgically salvageable disease whose planned \nsurgery was associated with severe morbidity (e.g. joint resection, limb amputation, or \nhemipelvectomy); cohort 3 included patients previously participating in study 5 and rolled over into \nthis study. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety profile of denosumab in subjects with \ngiant cell tumour of bone. The secondary outcome measures of the study included time to disease \nprogression (based on investigator assessment) for cohort 1 and proportion of patients without any \nsurgery at month 6 for cohort 2. \n \nIn cohort 1 at the final analysis, 28 of the 260 treated patients (10.8%) had disease progression. In \ncohort 2, 219 of the 238 (92.0%; 95% CI: 87.8%, 95.1%) evaluable patients treated with XGEVA had \nnot undergone surgery by month 6. Of the 239 subjects in cohort 2 with baseline target lesion location \nor on-study location not in lungs or soft tissue, a total of 82 subjects (34.3%) were able to avoid on-\nstudy surgery. Overall, efficacy results in skeletally mature adolescents were similar to those observed \nin adults. \n \nEffect on pain \n \nIn the final analysis cohorts 1 and 2 combined, a clinically meaningful reduction in worst pain \n(i.e. \u2265 2-point decrease from baseline) was reported for 30.8% of patients at risk (i.e. those who had a \nworst pain score of \u2265 2 at baseline) within 1 week of treatment, and \u2265 50% at week 5. These pain \nimprovements were maintained at all subsequent evaluations.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXGEVA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of skeletal related events in \npatients with bone metastases and subsets of the paediatric population below the age of 12 in the \ntreatment of giant cell tumour of bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nIn study 6, XGEVA has been evaluated in a subset of 28 adolescent patients (aged 13-17 years) with \ngiant cell tumour of bone who had reached skeletal maturity defined by at least 1 mature long bone \n(e.g. closed epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus) and body weight \u2265 45 kg. One adolescent subject \nwith surgically unsalvageable disease (N=14) had disease recurrence during initial treatment. Thirteen \nof the 14 subjects with surgically salvageable disease whose planned surgery was associated with \nsevere morbidity had not undergone surgery by month 6.   \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, bioavailability was 62%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDenosumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as native immunoglobulin and is \nunlikely to be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are \nexpected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides \nand individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \n \nIn subjects with advanced cancer, who received multiple doses of 120 mg every 4 weeks an \napproximate 2-fold accumulation in serum denosumab concentrations was observed and steady-state \nwas achieved by 6 months, consistent with time-independent pharmacokinetics. In subjects with \nmultiple myeloma who received 120 mg every 4 weeks, median trough levels varied by less than 8% \nbetween months 6 and 12. In subjects with giant cell tumour of bone who received 120 mg every \n4 weeks with a loading dose on days 8 and 15, steady-state levels were achieved within the first month \nof treatment. Between weeks 9 and 49, median trough levels varied by less than 9%. In subjects who \ndiscontinued 120 mg every 4 weeks, the mean half-life was 28 days (range 14 to 55 days). \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis did not indicate clinically significant changes in the systemic \nexposure of denosumab at steady-state with respect to age (18 to 87 years), race/ethnicity (Blacks, \nHispanics, Asians and Caucasians explored), gender or solid tumour types or patients with multiple \nmyeloma. Increasing body weight was associated with decreases in systemic exposure, and vice versa. \nThe alterations were not considered clinically-relevant, since pharmacodynamic effects based on bone \nturnover markers were consistent across a wide range of body weight. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nDenosumab displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics with dose over a wide dose range, but \napproximately dose-proportional increases in exposure for doses of 60 mg (or 1 mg/kg) and higher. \nThe non-linearity is likely due to a saturable target-mediated elimination pathway of importance at low \nconcentrations. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn studies of denosumab (60 mg, n = 55 and 120 mg, n = 32) in patients without advanced cancer but \nwith varying degrees of renal function, including patients on dialysis, the degree of renal impairment \nhad no effect on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab; thus dose adjustment for renal impairment is not \nrequired. There is no need for renal monitoring with XGEVA dosing. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo specific study in patients with hepatic impairment was performed. In general, monoclonal \nantibodies are not eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. The pharmacokinetics of denosumab \nis not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly \n \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between geriatric patients and younger \npatients. Controlled clinical studies of XGEVA in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone \n\n\n\n17 \n\nover age 65 revealed similar efficacy and safety in older and younger patients. No dose adjustment is \nrequired in elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn skeletally-mature adolescents (12-17 years of age) with giant cell tumour of bone who received \n120 mg every 4 weeks with a loading dose on days 8 and 15, the pharmacokinetics of denosumab were \nsimilar to those observed in adult subjects with GCTB. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSince the biological activity of denosumab in animals is specific to nonhuman primates, evaluation of \ngenetically engineered (knockout) mice or use of other biological inhibitors of the RANK/RANKL \npathway, such as OPG-Fc and RANK-Fc, were used to evaluate the pharmacodynamic properties of \ndenosumab in rodent models. \n \nIn mouse bone metastasis models of oestrogen receptor positive and negative human breast cancer, \nprostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, OPG-Fc reduced osteolytic, osteoblastic, and \nosteolytic/osteoblastic lesions, delayed formation of de novo bone metastases, and reduced skeletal \ntumour growth. When OPG-Fc was combined with hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) or chemotherapy \n(docetaxel) in these models, there was additive inhibition of skeletal tumour growth in breast, and \nprostate or lung cancer respectively. In a mouse model of mammary tumour induction, RANK-Fc \nreduced hormone-induced proliferation in mammary epithelium and delayed tumour formation. \n \nStandard tests to investigate the genotoxicity potential of denosumab have not been evaluated, since \nsuch tests are not relevant for this molecule. However, due to its character it is unlikely that \ndenosumab has any potential for genotoxicity. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of denosumab has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn single and repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, denosumab doses resulting in 2.7 \nto 15 times greater systemic exposure than the recommended human dose had no impact on \ncardiovascular physiology, male or female fertility, or produced specific target organ toxicity. \n \nIn a study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab during the period equivalent to the first \ntrimester of pregnancy, denosumab doses resulting in 9 times greater systemic exposure than the \nrecommended human dose did not induce maternal toxicity or foetal harm during a period equivalent \nto the first trimester, although foetal lymph nodes were not examined. \n \nIn another study of cynomolgus monkeys dosed with denosumab throughout pregnancy at systemic \nexposures 12-fold higher than the human dose, there were increased stillbirths and postnatal mortality; \nabnormal bone growth resulting in reduced bone strength, reduced haematopoiesis, and tooth \nmalalignment; absence of peripheral lymph nodes; and decreased neonatal growth. A no observed \nadverse effect level for reproductive effects was not established. Following a 6 month period after \nbirth, bone related changes showed recovery and there was no effect on tooth eruption. However, the \neffects on lymph nodes and tooth malalignment persisted, and minimal to moderate mineralisation in \nmultiple tissues was seen in one animal (relation to treatment uncertain). There was no evidence of \nmaternal harm prior to labour; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labour. Maternal \nmammary gland development was normal. \n \nIn preclinical bone quality studies in monkeys on long-term denosumab treatment, decreases in bone \nturnover were associated with improvement in bone strength and normal bone histology. \n \nIn male mice genetically engineered to express huRANKL (knock-in mice), which were subjected to a \ntranscortical fracture, denosumab delayed the removal of cartilage and remodelling of the fracture \ncallus compared to control, but biomechanical strength was not adversely affected. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIn preclinical studies knockout mice lacking RANK or RANKL had an absence of lactation due to \ninhibition of mammary gland maturation (lobulo-alveolar gland development during pregnancy) and \nexhibited impairment of lymph node formation. Neonatal RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited \ndecreased body weight, reduced bone growth, altered growth plates and lack of tooth eruption. \nReduced bone growth, altered growth plates and impaired tooth eruption were also seen in studies of \nneonatal rats administered RANKL inhibitors, and these changes were partially reversible when \ndosing of RANKL inhibitor was discontinued. Adolescent primates dosed with denosumab at 2.7 and \n15 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) the clinical exposure had abnormal growth plates. Therefore, \ntreatment with denosumab may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates and may \ninhibit eruption of dentition. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nXGEVA 120 mg solution for injection  \ndenosumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n- Your doctor will give you a patient reminder card, which contains important safety information \n\nyou need to be aware of before and during your treatment with XGEVA. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What XGEVA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use XGEVA \n3. How to use XGEVA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store XGEVA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What XGEVA is and what it is used for \n \nXGEVA contains denosumab, a protein (monoclonal antibody) that works to slow down bone \ndestruction caused by cancer spreading to the bone (bone metastasis) or by giant cell tumour of bone. \n \nXGEVA is used in adults with advanced cancer to prevent serious complications caused by bone \nmetastasis (e.g. fracture, pressure on the spinal cord or the need to receive radiation therapy or \nsurgery). \n \nXGEVA is also used to treat giant cell tumour of bone, which cannot be treated by surgery or where \nsurgery is not the best option, in adults and adolescents whose bones have stopped growing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use XGEVA \n \nDo not use XGEVA \n \n- if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nYour healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have a very low level of \ncalcium in your blood which has not been treated. \n \nYour healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have unhealed wounds from \ndental or oral surgery. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before using XGEVA. \n \nCalcium and vitamin D supplementation \nYou should take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with XGEVA unless your \nblood calcium is high. Your doctor will discuss this with you. If the level of calcium in your blood is \nlow, your doctor may decide to give you calcium supplements before you start treatment with \nXGEVA. \n \nLow calcium levels in the blood \nPlease tell your doctor immediately if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or \nnumbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of \nconsciousness while being treated with XGEVA. You may have low levels of calcium in your blood. \n \nRenal impairment \nTell your doctor if you have or have had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed \ndialysis, which may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium, especially if you do not take \ncalcium supplements. \n \nProblems with your mouth, teeth or jaw \nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported commonly \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients receiving XGEVA injections for cancer-related \nconditions. Osteonecrosis of the jaw can also occur after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is important to try to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw developing as it may be a painful condition \nthat can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there \nare some precautions you should take: \n \n\uf0b7 Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (healthcare professional) if you have any \n\nproblems with your mouth or teeth. Your doctor should delay the start of your treatment if you \nhave unhealed wounds in your mouth from dental procedures or oral surgery. Your doctor may \nrecommend a dental examination before you start treatment with XGEVA. \n\n\uf0b7 While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental \ncheck-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform \nyour doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with \nXGEVA. \n\n\uf0b7 Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth \nor teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could \nbe signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n\n \nPatients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, taking steroids or anti-angiogenic medicines \n(used to treat cancer), undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, have gum \ndisease or who are smokers, may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nUnusual thigh bone fractures \nSome people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with XGEVA. \nContact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. \n \nHigh calcium levels in the blood after stopping treatment with XGEVA \nSome patients with giant cell tumour of the bone have developed high calcium levels in the blood \nweeks to months after stopping treatment. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of \nhigh levels of calcium, after you stop receiving XGEVA. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \nXGEVA is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age except for \nadolescents with giant cell tumour of the bone whose bones have stopped growing. The use of \nXGEVA has not been studied in children and adolescents with other cancers that have spread to bone. \n \nOther medicines and XGEVA \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important that you \ntell your doctor if you are being treated with \n\uf0b7 another medicine containing denosumab \n\uf0b7 a bisphosphonate \n \nYou should not take XGEVA together with other medicines containing denosumab or \nbisphosphonates. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nXGEVA has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, \nthink you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant. XGEVA is not recommended for use if you are \npregnant. Women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while being \ntreated with XGEVA and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with XGEVA. \n \nIf you become pregnant during treatment with XGEVA or less than 5 months after stopping treatment \nwith XGEVA, please inform your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether XGEVA is excreted in breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you \nare breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop \nbreast-feeding or whether to stop taking XGEVA, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby \nand the benefit of XGEVA to the mother. \n \nIf you are nursing during treatment with XGEVA, please inform your doctor. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nXGEVA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nXGEVA contains sorbitol \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine, since it contains sorbitol (E420). \n \nXGEVA contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n3. How to use XGEVA \n \nXGEVA should be administered under the responsibility of a healthcare professional. \n \nThe recommended dose of XGEVA is 120 mg administered once every 4 weeks, as a single injection \nunder the skin (subcutaneous). XGEVA will be injected into your thigh, abdomen or upper arm. If you \nare being treated for giant cell tumour of bone, you will receive an additional dose 1 week and 2 weeks \nafter the first dose. \n \nDo not shake. \n \nYou should also take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with XGEVA unless \nyou have an excess of calcium in the blood. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPlease tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of these symptoms while being treated with \nXGEVA (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 spasms, twitches, cramps in your muscles, numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around \n\nyour mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness. These could be signs that you \nhave low calcium levels in the blood. Low calcium in the blood may also lead to a change in \nheart rhythm called QT prolongation, which is seen by electrocardiogram (ECG). \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any of these symptoms while \nbeing treated with XGEVA or after stopping treatment (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 persistent pain in the mouth and/or jaw, and/or swelling or non-healing of sores in the mouth or \n\njaw, discharge, numbness or feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth could be \nsigns of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). \n\n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 bone, joint, and/or muscle pain which is sometimes severe, \n\uf0b7 shortness of breath, \n\uf0b7 diarrhoea. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\uf0b7 low phosphate levels in the blood (hypophosphataemia), \n\uf0b7 removal of a tooth, \n\uf0b7 excessive sweating, \n\uf0b7 in patients with advanced cancer: development of another form of cancer. \n\n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\uf0b7 high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcaemia) after stopping treatment in patients with giant \n\ncell tumour of the bone, \n\uf0b7 new or unusual pain in your hip, groin or thigh (this may be an early indication of a possible \n\nfracture of the thigh bone), \n\uf0b7 rash that may occur on the skin or sores in the mouth (lichenoid drug eruptions). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\uf0b7 allergic reactions (e.g. wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat \n\nor other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin). In rare cases allergic reactions may \nbe severe. \n\n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\uf0b7 Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store XGEVA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nThe vial may be left outside the refrigerator to reach room temperature (up to 25\u00b0C) before injection. \nThis will make the injection more comfortable. Once your vial has been left to reach room temperature \n(up to 25\u00b0C), it must be used within 30 days. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

xgeva", "Section_Content": "do not use xgeva - if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). your healthcare professional will not administer xgeva to you if you have a very low level of calcium in your blood which has not been treated. your healthcare professional will not administer xgeva to you if you have unhealed wounds from dental or oral surgery. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using xgeva. calcium and vitamin d supplementation you should take calcium and vitamin d supplements while being treated with xgeva unless your blood calcium is high. your doctor will discuss this with you. if the level of calcium in your blood is low, your doctor may decide to give you calcium supplements before you start treatment with xgeva. low calcium levels in the blood please tell your doctor immediately if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with xgeva. you may have low levels of calcium in your blood. renal impairment tell your doctor if you have or have had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed dialysis, which may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium, especially if you do not take calcium supplements. problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw a side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients receiving xgeva injections for cancer-related conditions. osteonecrosis of the jaw can also occur after stopping treatment. it is important to try to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw developing as it may be a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. in order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you should take: before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (healthcare professional) if you have any problems with your mouth or teeth. your doctor should delay the start of your treatment if you have unhealed wounds in your mouth from dental procedures or oral surgery. your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start treatment with xgeva. while being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. if you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. if you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with xgeva. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, taking steroids or anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, have gum disease or who are smokers, may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. unusual thigh bone fractures some people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with xgeva. contact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. high calcium levels in the blood after stopping treatment with xgeva some patients with giant cell tumour of the bone have developed high calcium levels in the blood weeks to months after stopping treatment. your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of high levels of calcium, after you stop receiving xgeva. children and adolescents xgeva is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age except for adolescents with giant cell tumour of the bone whose bones have stopped growing. the use of xgeva has not been studied in children and adolescents with other cancers that have spread to bone. other medicines and xgeva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines obtained without a prescription. it is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are being treated with another medicine containing denosumab a bisphosphonate you should not take xgeva together with other medicines containing denosumab or bisphosphonates. pregnancy and breast-feeding xgeva has not been tested in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant. xgeva is not recommended for use if you are pregnant. women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while being treated with xgeva and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with xgeva. if you become pregnant during treatment with xgeva or less than 5 months after stopping treatment with xgeva, please inform your doctor. it is not known whether xgeva is excreted in breast milk. it is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or whether to stop taking xgeva, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of xgeva to the mother. if you are nursing during treatment with xgeva, please inform your doctor. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines xgeva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. xgeva contains sorbitol if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine, since it contains sorbitol (e420). xgeva contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "xgeva", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

in 10 people): spasms, twitches, cramps in your muscles, numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness. these could be signs that you have low calcium levels in the blood. low calcium in the blood may also lead to a change in heart rhythm called qt prolongation, which is seen by electrocardiogram (ecg). please tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any of these symptoms while being treated with xgeva or after stopping treatment (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): persistent pain in the mouth and/or jaw, and/or swelling or non-healing of sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness or feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): bone, joint, and/or muscle pain which is sometimes severe, shortness of breath, diarrhoea. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): low phosphate levels in the blood (hypophosphataemia), removal of a tooth, excessive sweating, in patients with advanced cancer: development of another form of cancer. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcaemia) after stopping treatment in patients with giant cell tumour of the bone, new or unusual pain in your hip, groin or thigh (this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone), rash that may occur on the skin or sores in the mouth (lichenoid drug eruptions). rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): allergic reactions (e.g. wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin). in rare cases allergic reactions may be severe. not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. these could be signs of bone damage in the ear. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this
