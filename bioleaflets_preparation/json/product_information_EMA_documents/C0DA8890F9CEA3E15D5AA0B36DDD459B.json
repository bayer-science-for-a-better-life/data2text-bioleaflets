NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nSIMBRINZA 10 mg/mL + 2 mg/mL eye drops, suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n1 mL of suspension contains 10 mg of brinzolamide and 2 mg of brimonidine tartrate equivalent to \n\n1.3 mg of brimonidine. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nEach mL of suspension contains 0.03 mg of benzalkonium chloride. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nEye drops, suspension (eye drops). \n\n \n\nWhite-to-off-white uniform suspension, pH 6.5 (approximately). \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDecrease of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \n\nhypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nUse in adults, including the elderly \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop of SIMBRINZA in the affected eye(s) two times daily. \n\n \n\nMissed dose \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. \n\n \n\nHepatic and/or renal impairment \n\nSIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and caution is therefore \n\nrecommended in this population (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or in \n\npatients with hyperchloraemic acidosis. Since the brinzolamide component of SIMBRINZA and its \n\nmetabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in such patients \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of SIMBRINZA in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA is contraindicated in neonates and infants aged less than 2 years in the decrease of \n\nelevated intraocular pressure (IOP) with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom \n\nmonotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction because of safety concerns (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to shake the bottle well before use. \n\n \n\nWhen nasolacrimal occlusion is used and the eyelids are closed for 2 minutes, systemic absorption is \n\nreduced. This may result in a decrease in systemic side effects and an increase in local activity (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, \n\nsurrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. Patients should be instructed to \n\nkeep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic medicinal products to lower \n\nintraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the \n\nmedicinal products must be administered at least 5 minutes apart. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nHypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients on antidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants and \n\nmianserin) (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients with hyperchloraemic acidosis. \n\nNeonates and infants under the age of 2 years (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe medicinal product should not be injected. Patients should be instructed not to swallow \n\nSIMBRINZA. \n\n \n\nOcular effects \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and its use is not \n\nrecommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nThe possible effect of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in \n\npatients with compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count). \n\nSpecifically, patients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these \n\npatients when using brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect \n\ncorneal hydration and wearing contact lenses might increase the risk for the cornea (for further \n\ninstructions on wearing contact lenses, see below under “Benzalkonium chloride”). Careful \n\nmonitoring of patients with compromised corneas, such as patients with diabetes mellitus or corneal \n\ndystrophies, is recommended. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine tartrate may cause ocular allergic reactions. If allergic reactions are observed, treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. Delayed ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with \n\nbrimonidine tartrate, with some reported to be associated with an increase in IOP. \n\n \n\nThe potential effects following cessation of treatment with SIMBRINZA have not been studied. While \n\nthe duration of IOP-lowering effect for SIMBRINZA has not been studied, the IOP-lowering effect of \n\nbrinzolamide is expected to last for 5-7 days. The IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine may be longer. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSystemic effects \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA contains brinzolamide, a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase and, although \n\nadministered topically, is absorbed systemically. The same types of adverse reactions that are \n\nattributable to sulphonamides may occur with topical administration. If signs of serious reactions or \n\nhypersensitivity occur, the use of this medicinal product should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of SIMBRINZA, small decreases in blood pressure were observed in some \n\npatients. Caution is advised when using medicinal products such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac \n\nglycosides concomitantly with SIMBRINZA or in patients with severe or unstable and uncontrolled \n\ncardiovascular disease (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary \n\ninsufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension or thromboangiitis obliterans. \n\n \n\nAcid/base disturbances \n\n \n\nAcid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. SIMBRINZA \n\ncontains brinzolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, and although administered topically, is \n\nabsorbed systemically. The same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to oral carbonic \n\ninhibitors (i.e. acid-base disturbances) may occur with topical administration (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA should be used with caution in patients with risk of renal impairment because of the \n\npossible risk of metabolic acidosis. SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; caution should be used in \n\ntreating such patients (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nMental alertness \n\n \n\nOral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness \n\nand/or physical coordination in elderly patients. SIMBRINZA is absorbed systemically and this may \n\ntherefore occur with topical administration (see section 4.7). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of SIMBRINZA in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years have not been \n\nestablished. Symptoms of brimonidine overdose (including loss of consciousness, hypotension, \n\nhypotonia, bradycardia, hypothermia, cyanosis and apnoea) have been reported in neonates and infants \n\nreceiving brimonidine eye drops as part of medical treatment of congenital glaucoma. SIMBRINZA is \n\ntherefore contraindicated in children below 2 years of age (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nTreatment of children 2 years and above (especially those in the 2-7 age range and/or weighing \n\n<20 kg) is not recommended because of the potential for central nervous system-related side effects \n\n(see section 4.9). \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to \n\ndiscolour soft contact lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses should be avoided. Patients must be \n\ninstructed to remove contact lens prior to application of SIMBRINZA and wait at least 15 minutes \n\nbefore reinsertion. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation and symptoms of dry eyes and may \n\naffect the tear film and corneal surface. It should be used with caution in dry eye patients and in \n\npatients whose cornea may be compromised. Patients should be monitored in case of prolonged use. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo specific drug interaction studies have been performed with SIMBRINZA. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors and in patients on \n\nantidepressants which affect noradrenergic transmission (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants and mianserin), \n\n(see section 4.3). Tricyclic antidepressants may blunt the ocular hypotensive response of \n\nSIMBRINZA. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised due to the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants \n\n(e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives or anaesthetics). \n\n \n\nNo data on the level of circulating catecholamines after SIMBRINZA administration are available. \n\nHowever, caution is advised in patients taking medicinal products which can affect the metabolism \n\nand uptake of circulating amines (e.g. chlorpromazine, methylphenidate, reserpine, serotonin-\n\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). \n\n \n\nAlpha adrenergic agonists (e.g. brimonidine tartrate), as a class, may reduce pulse and blood pressure. \n\nFollowing administration of SIMBRINZA, small decreases in blood pressure were observed in some \n\npatients. Caution is advised when using medicinal products such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac \n\nglycosides concomitantly with SIMBRINZA. \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when initiating (or changing the dose of) concomitant systemic medicinal products \n\n(irrespective of pharmaceutical form) which may interact with α-adrenergic agonists or interfere with \n\ntheir activity, i.e. agonists or antagonists of the adrenergic receptor (e.g. isoprenaline, prazosin). \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed \n\nsystemically. Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The \n\npotential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving SIMBRINZA. \n\n \n\nThere is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and topical brinzolamide. The \n\nconcomitant administration of SIMBRINZA and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nThe cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4 (main), \n\nCYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as \n\nketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of \n\nbrinzolamide by CYP3A4. Caution is advised if CYP3A4 inhibitors are given concomitantly. \n\nHowever, accumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. \n\nBrinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isozymes. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of SIMBRINZA in pregnant women. \n\nBrinzolamide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, following systemic administration (oral gavage). \n\nAnimal studies with oral brimonidine do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to \n\nreproductive toxicity. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the foetal \n\ncirculation to a limited extent (see section 5.3). SIMBRINZA is not recommended during pregnancy \n\nand in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether topical SIMBRINZA is excreted in human milk. Available \n\npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown that following oral administration, \n\nminimal levels of brinzolamide are excreted in breast milk. Brimonidine administered orally is \n\nexcreted in breast milk. SIMBRINZA should not be used by women who are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data do not show any effects of brinzolamide or brimonidine on fertility. There are no \n\ndata on the effect of topical ocular administration of SIMBRINZA on human fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nSIMBRINZA has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA may cause dizziness, fatigue and/or drowsiness, which may impair the ability to drive or \n\nuse machines. \n\n \n\nTemporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n\nIf blurred vision occurs at instillation the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or \n\nusing machines. \n\n \n\nOral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability of elderly patients to perform tasks requiring \n\nmental alertness and/or physical coordination (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials involving SIMBRINZA dosed twice daily the most common adverse reactions were \n\nocular hyperaemia and ocular allergic type reactions occurring in approximately 6-7% of patients, and \n\ndysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) occurring in approximately 3% \n\nof patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies with SIMBRINZA twice-\n\ndaily dosing and during clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance with the individual \n\ncomponents brinzolamide and brimonidine. They are classified according to the subsequent \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

It is likely to be caused by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal \n\ncanal and is mainly attributable to the brinzolamide component of SIMBRINZA. Nasolacrimal \n\nocclusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce the occurrence of this effect \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA contains brinzolamide, which is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with \n\nsystemic absorption. Gastrointestinal, nervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are \n\ngenerally associated with systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The same type of adverse reactions \n\nattributable to oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions commonly associated with the brimonidine component of SIMBRINZA include the \n\ndevelopment of ocular allergic type reactions, fatigue and/or drowsiness, and dry mouth. The use of \n\nbrimonidine has been associated with minimal decreases in blood pressure. Some patients who dosed \n\nwith SIMBRINZA experienced decreases in blood pressure similar to those observed with the use of \n\nbrimonidine as monotherapy. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIf overdose with SIMBRINZA occurs treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. The patient’s \n\nairway should be maintained. \n\n \n\nDue to the brinzolamide component of SIMBRINZA, electrolyte imbalance, development of an \n\nacidotic state, and possible nervous system effects may occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly \n\npotassium) and blood pH levels must be monitored. \n\n \n\nThere is very limited information regarding accidental ingestion with the brimonidine component of \n\nSIMBRINZA in adults. The only adverse reaction reported to date was hypotension. It was reported \n\nthat the hypotensive episode was followed by rebound hypertension. \n\n \n\nOral overdoses of other alpha-2-agonists have been reported to cause symptoms such as hypotension, \n\nasthenia, vomiting, lethargy, sedation, bradycardia, arrhythmias, miosis, apnoea, hypotonia, \n\nhypothermia, respiratory depression and seizure. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions following inadvertent ingestion with the brimonidine component of \n\nSIMBRINZA by paediatric subjects have been reported. The subjects experienced symptoms of CNS \n\ndepression, typically temporary coma or low level of consciousness, lethargy, somnolence, hypotonia, \n\nbradycardia, hypothermia, pallor, respiratory depression and apnoea, and required admission to \n\nintensive care with intubation if indicated. All subjects were reported to have made a full recovery, \n\nusually within 6-24 hours. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC \n\ncode: S01EC54 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA contains two active substances: brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate. These two \n\ncomponents lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular \n\nhypertension (OHT) by suppressing the formation of aqueous humour from the ciliary process in the \n\neye. Although both brinzolamide and brimonidine lower IOP by suppressing aqueous humour \n\nformation, their mechanisms of action are different. \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA-II) in the ciliary epithelium that \n\nreduces the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport \n\nacross the ciliary epithelium, resulting in decreased aqueous humour formation. Brimonidine, an \n\nalpha-2 adrenergic agonist, inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase and suppresses the cAMP-dependent \n\nformation of aqueous humour. Additionally, administration of brimonidine results in an increase in \n\nuveoscleral outflow. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nIn a 6-month, controlled, contribution of elements clinical study enrolling 560 patients with open-\n\nangle glaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component) and/or ocular \n\nhypertension who, in the investigator’s opinion, were insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or \n\nalready on multiple IOP-lowering medicinal products, and who had mean baseline diurnal IOP of \n\n26 mmHg, the mean diurnal IOP-lowering effect of SIMBRINZA dosed twice daily was \n\napproximately 8 mmHg. Statistically superior reductions in the mean diurnal IOP were observed with \n\nSIMBRINZA compared to brinzolamide 10 mg/ml or brimonidine 2 mg/ml dosed twice daily at all \n\nvisits throughout the study (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nFigure 1 Meana diurnal (9 AM, +2 hrs, +7 hrs) IOP change from baseline (mmHg) — \n\nContribution of elements study \n\n \n\n \naLeast squares means derived from a statistical model that accounts for study site, 9 AM baseline IOP stratum, \n\nand correlated IOP measurements within patient. \n\nAll treatment differences (SIMBRINZA versus individual components) were statistically significant with \n\np=0.0001 or less. \n\n \n\nMean IOP reductions from baseline at each time point at each visit were greater with SIMBRINZA (6 \n\nto 9 mmHg) than monotherapy with either brinzolamide (5 to 7 mmHg) or brimonidine (4 to \n\n7 mmHg). Mean percent IOP reductions from baseline with SIMBRINZA ranged from 23 to 34%. The \n\npercentages of patients with an IOP measurement less than 18 mmHg were greater in the \n\nSIMBRINZA group than in the Brinzolamide group at 9 of 12 assessments through Month 6 and were \n\ngreater in the SIMBRINZA group than in the Brimonidine group at all 12 assessments through \n\nMonth 6. At the +2 h time point (the time corresponding to the morning efficacy peak) for the primary \n\nefficacy visit at Month 3, the percentage of patients with an IOP less than 18 mmHg was 61.7% in the \n\nSIMBRINZA group, 40.1% in the Brinzolamide group, and 40.0% in the Brimonidine group. \n\n \n\nIn a 6-month, controlled, non-inferiority clinical study enrolling 890 patients with open-angle \n\nglaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component) and/or ocular hypertension \n\nwho, in the investigator’s opinion, were insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or already on \n\nmultiple IOP-lowering medicinal products, and who had mean baseline diurnal IOP of 26 to \n\n27 mmHg, non-inferiority of SIMBRINZA compared to brinzolamide 10 mg/mL + brimonidine \n\n2 mg/mL dosed concomitantly was demonstrated at all visits throughout the study with respect to \n\nmean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline (Table 1). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Comparison of mean diurnal IOP (mmHg) change from baseline – Non-inferiority \n\nstudy \n\n \n\nVisit SIMBRINZA \n\nMeana \n\nBrinzolamide + Brimonidine \n\nMeana \n\nDifference \n\nMeana (95% CI) \n\nWeek 2 -8.4 (n=394) -8.4 (n=384) -0.0 (-0.4, 0.3) \n\nWeek 6 -8.5 (n=384) -8.4 (n=377) -0.1 (-0.4, 0.2) \n\nMonth 3 -8.5 (n=384) -8.3 (n=373) -0.1 (-0.5, 0.2) \n\nMonth 6 -8.1 (n=346) -8.2 (n=330) 0.1 (-0.3, 0.4) \na Least squares means derived from a statistical model that accounts for study site, 9 AM \n\nbaseline IOP stratum, and correlated IOP measurements within patient \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nMean IOP reductions from baseline at each time point at each visit with SIMBRINZA or the \n\nindividual components administered concomitantly were similar (7 to 10 mmHg). Mean percent IOP \n\nreductions from baseline with SIMBRINZA ranged from 25 to 37%.The percentages of patients with \n\nan IOP measurement less than 18 mmHg were similar across study visits for the same time point \n\nthrough Month 6 in the SIMBRINZA and Brinzolamide + Brimonidine groups. At the +2 h time point \n\n(the time corresponding to the morning efficacy peak) for the primary efficacy visit at Month 3, the \n\npercentage of patients with an IOP less than 18 mmHg was 65.6% in the SIMBRINZA group and \n\n63.7% in the Brinzolamide + Brimonidine groups. \n\n \n\nAdjunct therapy \n\n \n\nClinical data on the use of SIMBRINZA adjunctive to prostaglandin analogues (PGA) also showed \n\nsuperior IOP-lowering efficacy of SIMBRINZA + PGA compared with the PGA alone. In study \n\nCQVJ499A2401, SIMBRINZA + PGA (i.e. travoprost, latanoprost, or bimatoprost) demonstrated \n\nsuperior IOP-lowering efficacy from baseline compared to Vehicle + PGA after 6 weeks of treatment, \n\nwith between-treatment difference in model-adjusted mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP \n\nof -3.44 mmHg (95% CI, -4.2, -2.7; p-value <0.001). \n\n \n\nClinical data on the use of SIMBRINZA adjunctive to travoprost-timolol maleate fixed dose \n\ncombination eye drops, solution also showed superior IOP-lowering efficacy of SIMBRINZA + \n\ntravoprost-timolol maleate eye drops compared with the travoprost-timolol maleate alone. In study \n\nCQVJ499A2402, SIMBRINZA + travoprost-timolol maleate eye drops demonstrated superior IOP-\n\nlowering efficacy from baseline compared to Vehicle + travoprost-timolol maleate eye drops after \n\n6 weeks of treatment, with between-treatment difference in model-adjusted mean change from \n\nbaseline in diurnal IOP of -2.15 mmHg (95% CI, -2.8, -1.5; p-value <0.001). \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of SIMBRINZA in adjunct therapy was similar to that observed with SIMBRINZA \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nThere are no efficacy and safety data for adjunct therapy beyond 6 weeks. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nSIMBRINZA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular \n\nhypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is absorbed through the cornea following topical ocular administration. The substance is \n\nalso absorbed into the systemic circulation, where it binds strongly to carbonic anhydrase in red blood \n\ncells (RBCs). Plasma concentrations are very low. Whole blood elimination half-life is prolonged \n\n(>100 days) in humans due to RBC carbonic anhydrase binding. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye following topical administration. In rabbits, maximum \n\nocular concentrations were achieved in less than one hour in most cases. Maximum human plasma \n\nconcentrations are <1 ng/mL and achieved within <1 hour. Plasma levels decline with a half-life of \n\napproximately 2-3 hours. No accumulation occurs during chronic administration. \n\n \n\nIn a topical ocular clinical study comparing the systemic pharmacokinetics of SIMBRINZA \n\nadministered two or three times daily to brinzolamide and brimonidine administered individually using \n\nthe same two posologies, the steady-state whole blood brinzolamide and N-desethylbrinzolamide \n\npharmacokinetics were similar between the combination product and brinzolamide administered alone. \n\nLikewise, the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of brimonidine from the combination were similar \n\n\n\n12 \n\nto those observed for brimonidine administered alone, with the exception of the twice daily \n\nSIMBRINZA treatment group, for which the mean AUC0-12 hours was about 25% lower than that for \n\nbrimonidine alone administered twice daily. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nStudies in rabbits showed that maximum brinzolamide ocular concentrations following topical \n\nadministration are in the anterior tissues such as cornea, conjunctiva, aqueous humour and iris-ciliary \n\nbody. Retention in ocular tissues is prolonged due to binding to carbonic anhydrase. Brinzolamide is \n\nmoderately (about 60%) bound to human plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine exhibits affinity for pigmented ocular tissues, particularly iris-ciliary body, due to its \n\nknown melanin binding properties. However, clinical and non-clinical safety data show it to be well-\n\ntolerated and safe during chronic administration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes, specifically CYP3A4, CYP2A6, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. The primary metabolite is N-desethylbrinzolamide, followed by the \n\nN-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites, as well as an N-propionic acid analogue formed \n\nby oxidation of the N-propyl side chain of O-desmethyl brinzolamide. Brinzolamide and N-\n\ndesethylbrinzolamide do not inhibit cytochrome P450 isozymes at concentrations at least 100-fold \n\nabove maximum systemic levels. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine is extensively metabolised by hepatic aldehyde oxidase, with formation of 2-\n\noxobrimonidine, 3-oxobrimonidine and 2,3-dioxobrimonidine being the major metabolites. Oxidative \n\ncleavage of the imidazoline ring to 5-bromo-6-guanidinoquinoxaline is also observed. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is primarily eliminated in urine unchanged. In humans, urinary brinzolamide and N-\n\ndesethylbrinzolamide accounted for about 60 and 6% of the dose, respectively. Data in rats showed \n\nsome biliary excretion (about 30%), primarily as metabolites. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine is primarily eliminated in the urine as metabolites. In rats and monkeys, urinary \n\nmetabolites accounted for 60 to 75% of oral or intravenous doses. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide pharmacokinetics are inherently non-linear due to saturable binding to carbonic \n\nanhydrase in whole blood and various tissues. Steady-state exposure does not increase in a dose-\n\nproportional manner. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, brimonidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the clinically therapeutic dose range. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA is intended for local action within the eye. Assessment of human ocular exposure at \n\nefficacious doses is not feasible. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in humans for \n\nIOP-lowering has not been established. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nStudies to determine the effects of age, race, and renal or hepatic impairment have not been conducted \n\nwith SIMBRINZA. A study of brinzolamide in Japanese versus non-Japanese subjects showed similar \n\nsystemic pharmacokinetics between the two groups. In a study of brinzolamide in subjects with renal \n\nimpairment, a 1.6- to 2.8-fold increase in the systemic exposure to brinzolamide and \n\nN-desethylbrinzolamide between normal and moderately renally-impaired subjects was demonstrated. \n\nThis increase in steady-state RBC concentrations of substance-related material did not inhibit RBC \n\ncarbonic anhydrase activity to levels that are associated with systemic side effects. However, the \n\ncombination product is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 mL/minute). \n\n \n\nThe Cmax, AUC and elimination half-life of brimonidine are similar in elderly (>65 years of age) \n\nsubjects compared to young adults. The effects of renal and hepatic impairment on the systemic \n\npharmacokinetics of brimonidine have not been evaluated. Given the low systemic exposure to \n\nbrimonidine following topical ocular administration, it is expected that changes in plasma exposure \n\nwould not be clinically relevant. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe systemic pharmacokinetics of brinzolamide and brimonidine, alone or in combination, in \n\npaediatric patients have not been studied. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBrinzolamide \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nEffects in non-clinical reproduction and development toxicity studies were observed only at exposures \n\nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to \n\nclinical use. In rabbits oral, maternally toxic doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day (261 times \n\nthe recommended daily clinical dose of 23 µg/kg/day) revealed no effect on foetal development. In \n\nrats doses of 18 mg/kg/day (783 times the recommended daily clinical dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day, \n\nresulted in slightly reduced ossification of skull and sternebrae of foetuses. These findings were \n\nassociated with metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased foetal \n\nweights. Dose related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams given 2 to \n\n18 mg/kg/day. During lactation, the no adverse effect level in the offspring was 5 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nBrimonidine \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \n\nand development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA 10 mg/ml + 2 mg/ml eye drops, suspension \n\nbrinzolamide/brimonidine tartrate \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist. This \nincludes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What SIMBRINZA is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use SIMBRINZA \n\n3. How to use SIMBRINZA \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store SIMBRINZA \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What SIMBRINZA is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA contains two active substances, brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate. Brinzolamide \n\nbelongs to a group of medicines called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and brimonidine tartrate belongs \n\nto a group of medicines called alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. Both substances work together to \n\nreduce pressure within the eye. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adult patients (aged 18 years and over) who have \n\neye conditions known as glaucoma or ocular hypertension and whose high pressure in the eyes cannot \n\nbe controlled effectively by one medicine alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use SIMBRINZA \n\n \n\nDo not use SIMBRINZA \n\n- if you are allergic to brinzolamide or brimonidine tartrate or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to sulphonamides (examples include medicines used to treat diabetes and \n\ninfections and also diuretics (water tablets)) \n\n- if you are taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (examples include medicines to treat \n\ndepression or Parkinson’s disease) or certain antidepressants. You must inform your doctor if \n\nyou are taking any antidepressant medicines \n\n- if you have severe kidney problems \n\n- if you have too much acidity in your blood (a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis) \n\n- in babies and infants aged less than 2 years. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist before using SIMBRINZA if you have now \n\nor have had in the past: \n\n- liver problems \n\n- a type of high pressure in the eyes called narrow-angle glaucoma \n\n- dry eyes or cornea problems \n\n- coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or \n\nchoking), heart failure, high or low blood pressure \n\n- depression \n\n- disturbed or poor blood circulation (such as Raynaud’s disease, Raynaud’s syndrome or cerebral \n\ninsufficiency). \n\n \n\nIf you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. See section “Wearing contact \n\nlenses - SIMBRINZA contains benzalkonium chloride” below). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nSIMBRINZA is not intended for use by children and adolescents aged below 18 years because it has \n\nnot been studied in this age group. It is particularly important that the medicine is not used in children \n\nunder the age of 2 years (see section ‘Do not use SIMBRINZA’ above) because it is unlikely to be \n\nsafe. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and SIMBRINZA \n\nTell your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might \n\nuse any other medicines. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for \n\nthe treatment of glaucoma. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking or intend to take any of the following medicines: \n\n- medicines to lower blood pressure \n- heart medicines including digoxin (used to treat heart conditions) \n- other medicines for glaucoma that also treat altitude sickness known as acetazolamide, \n\nmethazolamide and dorzolamide \n\n- medicines that can affect the metabolism, such as chlorpromazine, methylphenidate and \nreserpine \n\n- antiviral, antiretroviral (used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)) or antibiotic \nmedicines \n\n- antiyeast or antifungal medicines \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or antidepressants including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, \n\nclomipramine, mianserin, venlafaxine and duloxetine \n\n- anaesthetics \n- sedatives, opiates, or barbiturates \n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if the dose of any of your current medicines is changed. \n\n \n\nSIMBRINZA with alcohol \n\nIf you regularly consume alcohol, ask your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist for advice \n\nbefore taking this medicine. SIMBRINZA can be affected by alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, \n\noptometrist (optician) or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Women who may become \n\npregnant are advised to use effective contraception during SIMBRINZA treatment. The use of \n\nSIMBRINZA is not recommended during pregnancy. Do not use SIMBRINZA unless clearly \n\nindicated by your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, SIMBRINZA may pass into your milk. The use of SIMBRINZA is not \n\nrecommended during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal for a time just after using SIMBRINZA. \n\nSIMBRINZA may also cause dizziness, drowsiness or tiredness in some patients. \n\n \n\nDo not drive or use machines until the symptoms are cleared. \n\n \n\nWearing contact lenses - SIMBRINZA contains benzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 5 ml, which is equivalent to \n\n0.03 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the \n\ncontact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back \n\n15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have \n\ndry eyes or a disorder of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye \n\nsensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use SIMBRINZA \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist has told you. \n\nCheck with your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nOnly use SIMBRINZA for your eyes. Do not swallow or inject. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes two times a day. Use at the same time \n\neach day. \n\n \n\nHow to use \n\n \n\nWash your hands before you start. \n\n \n\n  \n1 2 \n\n \n\nShake well before use. \n\nTwist off the bottle cap. After the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove it \n\nbefore using the medicine. \n\nDo not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could infect the \n\ndrops. \n\nHold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. \n\nTilt your head back. \n\nPull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your \n\neye. The drop will go in here (picture 1). \n\nBring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. \n\nDo not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could infect \n\nthe drops. \n\nGently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of SIMBRINZA. \n\nDo not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs \n\n(picture 2). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the amount of medicine that could come into the rest of the body after application of the eye \n\ndrop, close your eye and apply gentle pressure to the corner of the eye next to the nose with a finger \n\nfor at least 2 minutes. \n\n \n\nIf you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. It is not necessary to close and \n\nshake the bottle before you apply the drop in your other eye. Close the bottle cap firmly immediately \n\nafter use. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops as well as SIMBRINZA, wait at least five minutes between using \n\nSIMBRINZA and the other drops. \n\n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you use more SIMBRINZA than you should \n\nRinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAdults who accidentally swallowed medicines containing brimonidine experienced a decreased heart \n\nrate, decreased blood pressure which may be followed by increased blood pressure, heart failure, \n\ndifficulty breathing and effects in the nervous system. Should this happen, contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nSerious side effects have been reported in children who accidently swallowed medicines containing \n\nbrimonidine. Signs included sleepiness, floppiness, low body temperature, paleness and breathing \n\ndifficulties. Should this happen, contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf SIMBRINZA has been accidentally swallowed then you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use SIMBRINZA \n\nContinue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do \n\nnot use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) two times a day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using SIMBRINZA \n\nDo not stop using SIMBRINZA without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using SIMBRINZA \n\nthe pressure in your eye will not be controlled, which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, optometrist (optician) or \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
