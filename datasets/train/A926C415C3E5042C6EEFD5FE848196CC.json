NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVoriconazole Hikma 200 mg powder for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 200 mg of voriconazole.  \n \nAfter reconstitution each ml contains 10 mg of voriconazole. Once reconstituted further dilution is required \nbefore administration. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach vial contains 217.6 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for infusion (powder for infusion) \n \nWhite to off-white lyophilised cake.  \n \npH of the reconstituted solution is 4.0 to 7.0. \n \nOsmolality: 500\u00b1 50 mOsm/kg \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVoriconazole is a broad spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and children aged 2 \nyears and above as follows: \n  \n\u2022 Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.  \n\u2022 Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients  \n\u2022 Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).  \n\u2022 Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.  \n \nVoriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening \ninfections. \n \nProphylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nrecipients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored \nand corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIt is recommended that voriconazole is administered at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour over 1 to 3 \nhours.  \n \nTreatment \n \nAdults  \nVoriconazole Hikma 200 mg powder for solution for infusion is for intravenous use only.  Oral dosage forms \nof voriconazole are available from other manufacturers. \n \nTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral voriconazole \nto achieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral \nbioavailability (96 %; see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and oral administration is appropriate \nwhen clinically indicated.  \n \nDetailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table: \n  \n  Intravenous Oral* \n\n    Patients 40 kg and \nabove** \n\nPatients less than \n40 kg** \n\nLoading dose regimen  \n(first 24 hours) \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 hours  400 mg every 12 hours  200 mg every 12 hours  \n\nMaintenance dose  \n(after first 24 hours) \n\n4 mg/kg twice daily  200 mg twice daily  100 mg twice daily  \n\n*Oral dosage forms of voriconazole are available from other manufacturers \n**This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older.  \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient\u2019s clinical and mycological  \nresponse. Long term exposure to voriconazole greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment \nof the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nDosage adjustment (Adults) \nIf patient is unable to tolerate intravenous treatment at 4 mg/kg twice daily, reduce the dose to 3 mg/kg twice \ndaily.  \n \nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice daily \nfor oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg twice daily. \n \nIf patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the 200 mg \ntwice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose. \n \nIn case of use as prophylaxis, refer below. \n \nChildren (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg) \nVoriconazole should be dosed as children as these young adolescents may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adults. \n \nThe recommended dosing regimen is as follows:  \n  Intravenous  Oral* \n\nLoading Dose Regimen  \n(first 24 hours)  \n\n9 mg/kg every 12 hours  Not recommended  \n\nMaintenance Dose  8 mg/kg twice daily  9 mg/kg twice daily  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n(after first 24 hours)  (a maximum dose of 350 mg twice \ndaily)  \n\n*Oral dosage forms of voriconazole are available from other manufacturers \nNote: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged \n2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years.  \n \nIt is recommended to initiate the therapy with intravenous regimen, and oral regimen should be considered \nonly after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose \nwill provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.  \n \nAll other adolescents (12 to 14 years and \u226550 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight)  \nVoriconazole should be dosed as adults.  \n \nDosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 years \nand <50 kg]) \nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the intravenous dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps. If \npatients are unable to tolerate treatment, reduce the intravenous dose by 1 mg/kg steps.  \n \nUse in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied (see  \nsections 4.8 and 5.2).  \n \nProphylaxis in adults and children \n \nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for up to 100 days. \nProphylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for developing invasive fungal infection \n(IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to 180 days after \ntransplantation in case of continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease (GvHD) (see section \n5.1). \n \nDosage \nThe recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age groups. \nPlease refer to the treatment tables above. \n \nDuration of prophylaxis \nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied in \nclinical trials.  \n \nUse of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of the \nbenefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis. \n \nDosage adjustment \nFor prophylaxis use, dose adjustments are not recommended in the case of lack of efficacy or treatment \nrelated adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and \nuse of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8) \n \nDosage adjustments in case of co-administration \nRifabutin or phenytoin may be co-administered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is \nincreased to 5 mg/kg intravenously twice daily, see sections 4.4 and 4.5.  \n \nEfavirenz may be co-administered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to \n400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once daily. When treatment \nwith voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \nElderly \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment  \nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), accumulation of the \nintravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an \nassessment of the risk benefit to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine \nlevels should be closely monitored in these patients and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to \nchanging to oral voriconazole therapy (see section 5.2).  \n \nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4 hour haemodialysis session does not \nremove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.  \n \nThe intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is haemodialysed with a clearance of 55 ml/min.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved \nin patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole (see section \n5.2).  \n \nVoriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C).  \n \nThere is limited data on the safety of voriconazole in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate \ntransaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or total bilirubin >5 times the \nupper limit of normal).  \n \nVoriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, \nsuch as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs \nthe potential risk. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole in children below 2 years has not been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nVoriconazole Hikma requires reconstitution and dilution (see section 6.6) prior to administration as an \nintravenous infusion. Not for bolus injection.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nCo-administration with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine since \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare \noccurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5).  \n \nCo-administration with rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital since these medicinal products are \nlikely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see section 4.5).  \n \nCo-administration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg once daily or higher is \ncontraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy \nsubjects at  thesedoses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations (see \nsection 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCo-administration with high dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) because ritonavir significantly \ndecreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose. (see section 4.5, for lower \ndoses see section 4.4).  \n \nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), which are CYP3A4 substrates, \nsince increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to ergotism (see section 4.5).  \n \nCo-administration with sirolimus, since voriconazole is likely to increase plasma concentrations of sirolimus \nsignificantly (see section 4.5).  \n \nCo-administration with St John's Wort (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nCaution should be used in prescribing Voriconazole Hikma to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles \n(see also section 4.8).  \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nThe duration of treatment with the intravenous formulation should be no longer than 6 months (see section \n5.3).  \n \nCardiovascular \n \nVoriconazole has been associated with QTc interval prolongation. There have been rare cases of torsades de \npointes in patients taking voriconazole who had risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, \ncardiomyopathy, hypokalaemia and concomitant medicinal products that may have been contributory.  \n \nVoriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such \nas  \n\u2022 Congenital or acquired QTc-prolongation  \n\u2022 Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present  \n\u2022 Sinus bradycardia  \n\u2022 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias  \n\u2022 Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QTc interval. Electrolyte disturbances such \n\nas hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if \nnecessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2). A study has been \nconducted in healthy volunteers which examined the effect on QTc interval of single doses of \nvoriconazole up to 4 times the usual daily dose. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the \npotentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec (see section 5.1).  \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions, predominantly flushing and nausea, have been observed during administration of \nthe intravenous formulation of voriconazole. Depending on the severity of symptoms, consideration should \nbe given to stopping treatment (see section 4.8).  \n \nHepatic toxicity \n \nIn clinical trials, there have been cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole \n(including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of \nhepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions \n(predominantly haematological malignancy). Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, \n\n\n\n7 \n\nhave occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been \nreversible on discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.8).  \n \nMonitoring of hepatic function \n \nPatients receiving voriconazole must be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Clinical management \nshould include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (specifically AST and ALT) at the initiation of \ntreatment with voriconazole and at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Treatment should be as \nshort as possible, however, if based on the benefit-risk assessment the treatment is continued (see section \n4.2), monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly if there are no changes in the liver function tests.  \n \nIf the liver function tests become markedly elevated, Voriconazole Hikma should be discontinued, unless the \nmedical judgment of the risk-benefit of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use.  \n \nMonitoring of hepatic function should be carried out in both children and adults.  \n \nSerious dermatological adverse reactions \n \n\n\u2022 Phototoxicity \nIn addition VORICONAZOLE HIKMA has been associated with phototoxicity including reactions \nsuch as ephelides, lentigo, actinic keratosis and pseudoporphyria. It is recommended that all patients, \nincluding children, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VORICONAZOLE HIKMA treatment \nand use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported in patients, some of whom have reported \nprior phototoxic reactions. If phototoxic reactions occur multidisciplinary advice should be sought, \nVORICONAZOLE HIKMA discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be \nconsidered and the patient should be referred to a dermatologist. If VORICONAZOLE HIKMA is \ncontinued, however, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, \nto allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. VORICONAZOLE HIKMA \nshould be discontinued if premalignant skin lesions or squamous cell carcinoma are identified (see \nbelow the section under Long-term treatment). \n\n \n\u2022 Exfoliative cutaneous reactions \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), \nwhich can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported with the use of voriconazole. If a patient \ndevelops a rash he should be monitored closely and VORICONAZOLE HIKMA discontinued if \nlesions progress. \n\n \n\nLong-term treatment \nLong term exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \nassessment of the benefit-risk balance and physicians should therefore consider the need to limit the \nexposure to VORICONAZOLE HIKMA (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) has been reported in relation with long-term \nVORICONAZOLE HIKMA treatment. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in \ntransplant patients. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with \nperiostitis VORICONAZOLE HIKMA discontinuation should be considered after multidisciplinary \n\n\n\n8 \n\nadvice. \n\nVisual adverse reactions \n \nThere have been reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including blurred vision, optic neuritis and \npapilloedema (see section 4.8).  \n \nRenal adverse reactions \n \nAcute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. \nPatients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medicinal \nproducts and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function (see section 4.8).  \n \nMonitoring of renal function \n \nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory \nevaluation, particularly serum creatinine.  \n \nMonitoring of pancreatic function \n \nPatients, especially children, with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)), should be monitored closely during voriconazole \ntreatment. Monitoring of serum amylase or lipase may be considered in this clinical situation.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of two years has not been established (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). Voriconazole is indicated for paediatric patients aged two years or older. A higher \nfrequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the paediatric population (see section 4.8). Hepatic \nfunction should be monitored in both children and adults. Oral bioavailability may be limited in paediatric \npatients aged 2 to <12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight for age. In that case, intravenous \nvoriconazole administration is recommended.  \n \n\n\u2022 Serious dermatological adverse reactions (including SCC) \nThe frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the paediatric population. As an evolution towards \nSCC has been reported, stringent measures for the photoprotection are warranted in this population of \npatients. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and \ndermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. \n\n \nProphylaxis \n \nIn case of treatment-related adverse events (hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions including phototoxicity and \nSCC, severe or prolonged visual disorders and periostitis), discontinuation of voriconazole and use of \nalternative antifungal agents must be considered. \n \nPhenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer) \n \nCareful monitoring of phenytoin levels is recommended when phenytoin is co-administered with \nvoriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit \noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5).  \n \nEfavirenz (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \n \nWhen voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz the dose of voriconazole should be increased to 400 mg \nevery 12 hours and that of efavirenz should be decreased to 300 mg every 24 hours (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and \n4.5).  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nRifabutin (Potent CYP450 inducer)  \n \nCareful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions to rifabutin (e.g., uveitis) is recommended \nwhen rifabutin is co-administered with voriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and rifabutin should \nbe avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.5).  \n \nRitonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)  \n \nCo-administration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see sections 4.5 and 4.3).  \n \nEverolimus (CYP3A4 substrate, P-gp substrate) \n \nCo-administration of voriconazole with everolimus is not recommended because voriconazole is expected to \nsignificantly increase everolimus concentrations. Currently there are insufficient data to allow dosing \nrecommendations in this situation (see section 4.5).  \n \nMethadone (CYP3A4 substrate)  \n \nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to methadone, including QTc prolongation, is \nrecommended when co-administered with voriconazole since methadone levels increased following co-\nadministration of voriconazole. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed (see section 4.5).  \n \nShort acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate) \n \nReduction in the dose of alfentanil, fentanyl and other short acting opiates similar in structure to alfentanil \nand metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when co-administered with voriconazole \n(see section 4.5). As the half-life of alfentanil is prolonged in a 4-fold manner when alfentanil is co-\nadministered with voriconazole and in an independent published study, concomitant use of voriconazole with \nfentanyl resulted in an increase in the mean AUC 0-\u221e of fentanyl, frequent monitoring for opiate-associated \nadverse reactions (including a longer respiratory monitoring period) may be necessary.  \n \nLong acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate) \n \nReduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., \nhydrocodone) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Frequent monitoring for opiate-\nassociated adverse reactions may be necessary (see section 4.5).  \n \nFluconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) \n \nCoadministration of oral voriconazole and oral fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in Cmax and \nAUC\u03c4 of voriconazole in healthy subjects. The reduced dose and/or frequency of voriconazole and \nfluconazole that would eliminate this effect have not been established. Monitoring for voriconazole \nassociated adverse reactions is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains 217.6 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 10.9% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nVoriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, \nCYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole \n\n\n\n10 \n\nplasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes.  \n \nUnless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male subjects \nusing multiple dosing to steady state with oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). These results are \nrelevant to other populations and routes of administration.  \n \nVoriconazole should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medication that is known to \nprolong QTc interval. When there is also a potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma concentrations \nof substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, cisapride, pimozide), \nco-administration is contraindicated (see below and section 4.3).  \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once daily as \n\u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \u201cBID\u201d, three times daily as \u201cTID\u201d and not determined as \u201cND\u201d). The direction of the \narrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean \nratio being within (\u2194), below (\u2193) or above (\u2191) the 80-125% range.

These visual impairmentswere transient and fully reversible, with the \nmajority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant long-term visual effects \nwere observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of voriconazole. The visual \nimpairmentswere generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were not associated with long-term \nsequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses.  \n \nThe mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a \nstudy in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused \na decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG measures electrical currents in the \nretina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment and were fully reversible on withdrawal \nof voriconazole.  \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4). \n \nDermatological reactions  \nDermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but these \npatients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal products. The \n\n\n\n20 \n\nmajority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Patients have developed severe cutaneous adverse \nreactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN) (rare), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema \nmultiforme (rare) during treatment with voriconazole (see section 4.4).  \n \nIf patients develop a rash they should be monitored closely and Voriconazole Hikma discontinued if lesions \nprogress. Photosensitivity reactions, such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis, have been reported, \nespecially during long-term therapy (see section 4.4).  \n \nThere have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with voriconazole for long \nperiods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4).  \n \nLiver function tests \nThe overall incidence of transaminase increases >3 xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse event) in \nthe voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0% (319/1768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in paediatric \nsubjects  who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver function test \nabnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal \nliver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, \nincluding discontinuation of therapy.  \n \nVoriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious \nunderlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice,  hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nDuring infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type \nreactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnoea, faintness, nausea, \npruritus and rash have occurred. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion (see section \n4.4). \n \nProphylaxis \nIn an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary \nprophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, \npermanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus 39.6% of \nsubjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of \nstudy medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with \nitraconazole. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and 12 to \n<18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in clinical trials. \nThe safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in \ncompassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in paediatric population was similar \nto that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations, reported as \nadverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric patients as compared to adults (14.2% \ntransaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in adults). Post-marketing data suggest there might \nbe a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially erythema) in the paediatric population compared to \nadults. In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, \nthe following adverse reactions (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were \nreported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic \nenzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis \nin paediatric patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials there were 3 cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in paediatric patients, who received \nup to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse reaction of \nphotophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported.  \n \nThere is no known antidote to voriconazole.  \n \nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is \nhaemodialysed with a clearance of 55 ml/min. In an overdose, haemodialysis may assist in the removal of \nvoriconazole and SBECD from the body. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, \u2013 triazole derivatives ATC code: J02AC03 \n \nMode of action \n \nVoriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the inhibition of \nfungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in fungal ergosterol \nbiosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol \nin the fungal cell membrane and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of voriconazole. Voriconazole \nhas been shown to be more selective for fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for various mammalian \ncytochrome P-450 enzyme systems.  \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nIn 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual \nsubjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ml) and 3742 ng/ml (inter-\nquartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ml), respectively. A positive association between mean, maximum or \nminimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy in therapeutic studies was not found and this \nrelationship has not been explored in prophylaxis studies.  \n \nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analyses of clinical trial data identified positive associations between \nplasma voriconazole concentrations and both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances. Dose \nadjustments in prophylaxis studies have not been explored. \n \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against Candida \nspecies (including fluconazole resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and C. albicans) and \nfungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows in vitro fungicidal \nactivity against emerging fungal pathogens, including those such as Scedosporium or Fusarium which have \nlimited susceptibility to existing antifungal agents.  \n \nClinical efficacy defined as partial or complete response, has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. \nincluding A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans, Candida spp., including C. albicans, C. \nglabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis and limited numbers of C. dubliniensis, C. inconspicua \nand C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. prolificans and Fusarium spp.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\n \nOther treated fungal infections (often with partial or complete response) included isolated cases of Alternaria \nspp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., Coccidioides immitis, \nConidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, Exophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium spp. including P. marneffei, \nPhialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Trichosporon spp. including T. beigelii infections.  \n \nIn vitro activity against clinical isolates has been observed for Acremonium spp., Alternaria spp., Bipolaris \nspp., Cladophialophora spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, with most strains being inhibited by concentrations \nof voriconazole in the range 0.05 to 2 \u03bcg/ml.  \n \nIn vitro activity against the following pathogens has been shown, but the clinical significance is unknown: \nCurvularia spp. and Sporothrix spp.  \n \nBreakpoints  \n \nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be \nobtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the \nresults of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, \nanti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.  \n \nThe species most frequently involved in causing human infections include C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. \ntropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei, all of which usually exhibit minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) \nof less than 1 mg/L for voriconazole.  \n \nHowever, the in vitro activity of voriconazole against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for C. \nglabrata, the MICs of voriconazole for fluconazole-resistant isolates are proportionally higher than are those \nof fluconazole-susceptible isolates. Therefore, every attempt should be made to identify Candida to species \nlevel. If antifungal susceptibility testing is available, the MIC results may be interpreted using breakpoint \ncriteria established by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).  \n \nEUCAST Breakpoints \n \nCandida Species MIC breakpoint (mg/L) \n\n\u2264S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant) \n\nCandida albicans1 0.125  0.125  \n\nCandida tropicalis1 0.125  0.125  \n\nCandida parapsilosis1 0.125  0.125  \n\nCandida glabrata2 Insufficient evidence  \n\nCandida krusei3 Insufficient evidence  \n\nOther Candida spp.4 Insufficient evidence  \n1 Strains with MIC values above the Susceptible (S) breakpoint are rare, or not yet reported. The \nidentification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests on any such isolate must be repeated and if the result is \nconfirmed the isolate sent to a reference laboratory.  \n2 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in patients with C glabrata infections was 21% lower \ncompared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. . In vitro data showed a slight increase of \nresistance of C. glabrata to voriconazole \n3 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in C. krusei infections was similar to C. albicans, C. \nparapsilosis and C. tropicalis. However, as there were only 9 cases available for EUCAST analysis, there is \ncurrently insufficient evidence to set clinical breakpoints for C. krusei.  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n4 EUCAST has not determined non-species related breakpoints for voriconazole.  \n \nClinical experience \n \nSuccessful outcome in this section is defined as complete or partial response.  \n \nAspergillus infections \u2013 efficacy in aspergillosis patients with poor prognosis  \nVoriconazole has in vitro fungicidal activity against Aspergillus spp. The efficacy and survival benefit of \nvoriconazole versus conventional amphotericin B in the primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis \nwas demonstrated in an open, randomised, multicentre study in 277 immunocompromised patients treated for \n12 weeks. Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for \nthe first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for a minimum of seven days. \nTherapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. Median duration \nof IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2-85 days). After IV voriconazole therapy, the median \nduration of oral voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2-232 days).  \n \nA satisfactory global response (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms signs, \nradiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53 % of voriconazole-treated \npatients compared to 31 % of patients treated with comparator. The 84-day survival rate for voriconazole \nwas statistically significantly higher than that for the comparator and a clinically and statistically significant \nbenefit was shown in favour of voriconazole for both time to death and time to discontinuation due to \ntoxicity.  \n \nThis study confirmed findings from an earlier, prospectively designed study where there was a positive \noutcome in subjects with risk factors for a poor prognosis, including graft versus host disease, and, in \nparticular, cerebral infections (normally associated with almost 100 % mortality).  \n \nThe studies included cerebral, sinus, pulmonary and disseminated aspergillosis in patients with bone marrow \nand solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, cancer and AIDS.  \n \nCandidaemia in non-neutropenic patients  \nThe efficacy of voriconazole compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in the \nprimary treatment of candidaemia was demonstrated in an open, comparative study. Three hundred and \nseventy non-neutropenic patients (above 12 years of age) with documented candidaemia were included in the \nstudy, of whom 248 were treated with voriconazole. Nine subjects in the voriconazole group and five in the \namphotericin B followed by fluconazole group also had mycologically proven infection in deep tissue. \nPatients with renal failure were excluded from this study. The median treatment duration was 15 days in both \ntreatment arms. In the primary analysis, successful response as assessed by a Data Review Committee (DRC) \nblinded to study medicinal product was defined as resolution/improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms \nof infection with eradication of Candida from blood and infected deep tissue sites at 12 weeks after the end \nof therapy (EOT). Patients who did not have an assessment 12 weeks after EOT were counted as failures. In \nthis analysis a successful response was seen in 41 % of patients in both treatment arms.  \n \nIn a secondary analysis, which utilised DRC assessments at the latest evaluable time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or \n12 weeks after EOT) voriconazole and the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole had \nsuccessful response rates of 65 % and 71 %, respectively. The Investigator's assessment of successful \noutcome at each of these time points is shown in the following table.  \n \nTimepoint Voriconazole  \n\n(N=248)  \nAmphotericin B \u2192 fluconazole  \n(N=122)  \n\nEOT  178 (72 %)  88 (72 %)  \n\n2 weeks after EOT  125 (50 %)  62 (51 %)  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n6 weeks after EOT  104 (42 %)  55 (45 %)  \n\n12 weeks after EOT  104 (42 %)  51 (42 %)  \n \nSerious refractory Candida infections  \nThe study comprised 55 patients with serious refractory systemic Candida infections (including \ncandidaemia, disseminated and other invasive candidiasis) where prior antifungal treatment, particularly with \nfluconazole, had been ineffective. Successful response was seen in 24 patients (15 complete, 9 partial \nresponses). In fluconazole-resistant non albicans species, a successful outcome was seen in 3/3 C. krusei \n(complete responses) and 6/8 C. glabrata (5 complete, 1 partial response) infections. The clinical efficacy \ndata were supported by limited susceptibility data.  \n \nScedosporium and Fusarium infections  \nVoriconazole was shown to be effective against the following rare fungal pathogens:  \n \nScedosporium spp.: Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 16 (6 complete, 10 partial \nresponses) of 28 patients with S. apiospermum and in 2 (both partial responses) of 7 patients with S. \nprolificans infection. In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with infections caused by \nmore than one organism including Scedosporium spp.  \n \nFusarium spp.: Seven (3 complete, 4 partial responses) of 17 patients were successfully treated with \nvoriconazole. Of these 7 patients, 3 had eye, 1 had sinus, and 3 had disseminated infection. Four additional \npatients with fusariosis had an infection caused by several organisms; two of them had a successful outcome.  \n \nThe majority of patients receiving voriconazole treatment of the above mentioned rare infections were \nintolerant of, or refractory to, prior antifungal therapy.  \n \nPrimary Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections \u2013 Efficacy in HSCT recipients without prior proven or \nprobable IFI \n \nVoriconazole was compared to itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in an open-label, comparative, \nmulticenter study of adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI. \nSuccess was defined as the ability to continue study drug prophylaxis for 100 days after HSCT (without \nstopping for >14 days) and survival with no proven or probable IFI for 180 days after HSCT. The modified \nintent-to-treat (MITT) group included 465 allogeneic HSCT recipients with 45% of patients having AML. \nFrom all patients 58% were subject to myeloablative conditions regimens. Prophylaxis with study drug was \nstarted immediately after HSCT: 224 received voriconazole and 241 received itraconazole. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 96 days for voriconazole and 68 days for itraconazole in the MITT \ngroup. \n \nSuccess rates and other secondary endpoints are presented in the table below: \n \n \n\nStudy Endpoints Voriconazole \nN=224 \n\nItraconazole \nN=241 \n\nDifference in \nproportions and the \n\n95% confidence \ninterval (CI) \n\nP-Value \n\nSuccess at day 180* 109 (48.7%) 80 (33.2%) 16.4% (7.7%, 25.1%)** 0.0002** \nSuccess at day 100 121 (54.0%) 96 (39.8%) 15.4% (6.6%, 24.2%)** 0.0006** \nCompleted at least 100 days of \nstudy drug prophylaxis \n\n120 (53.6%) 94 (39.0%) 14.6% (5.6%, 23.5%) 0.0015 \n\nSurvived to day 180 184 (82.1%) 197 (81.7%) 0.4% (-6.6%, 7.4%) 0.9107 \nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 180 \n\n3 (1.3%) 5 (2.1%) -0.7% (-3.1%, 1.6%) 0.5390 \n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI to day 100 \n\n2 (0.9%) 4 (1.7%) -0.8% (-2.8%, 1.3%) 0.4589 \n\n\n\n25 \n\nDeveloped proven or probable \nIFI while on study drug \n\n0 3 (1.2%) -1.2% (-2.6%, 0.2%) 0.0813 \n\n* Primary endpoint of the study \n** Difference in proportions, 95% CI and p-values obtained after adjustment for randomization \n \nThe breakthrough IFI rate to Day 180 and the primary endpoint of the study, which is Success at Day 180, \nfor patients with AML and myeloablative conditioning regimens respectively, is presented in the table \nbelow: \n \nAML \n \n \n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=98) \n\nItraconazole \n(N=109) \n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI) \nBreakthrough IFI \u2013 Day 180 1 (1.0%) 2 (1.8%) -0.8% (-4.0%, 2.4%) ** \n\nSuccess at Day 180* 55 (56.1%) 45 (41.3%) 14.7% (1.7%, 27.7%)*** \n* Primary endpoint of study \n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n***Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n \nMyeloablative conditioning regimens \n \n \n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazole \n(N=125) \n\nItraconazole \n(N=143) \n\nDifference in proportions \nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI) \nBreakthrough IFI \u2013 Day 180 2 (1.6%) 3 (2.1%) -0.5% (-3.7%, 2.7%) ** \n\nSuccess at Day 180* 70 (56.0%) 53 (37.1%) 20.1% (8.5%, 31.7%)*** \n* Primary endpoint of study \n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated \n*** Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n \nSecondary Prophylaxis of IFI \u2013 Efficacy in HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI \n \nVoriconazole was investigated as secondary prophylaxis in an open-label, non-comparative, multicenter \nstudy of adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI. The primary endpoint was the \nrate of occurrence of proven and probable IFI during the first year after HSCT. The MITT group included 40 \npatients with prior IFI, including 31 with aspergillosis, 5 with candidiasis, and 4 with other IFI. The median \nduration of study drug prophylaxis was 95.5 days in the MITT group. \n \nProven or probable IFIs developed in 7.5% (3/40) of patients during the first year after HSCT, including one \ncandidemia, one scedosporiosis (both relapses of prior IFI), and one zygomycosis. The survival rate at Day \n180 was 80.0% (32/40) and at 1 year was 70.0% (28/40). \n \nDuration of treatment  \n \nIn clinical trials, 705 patients received voriconazole therapy for greater than 12 weeks, with 164 patients \nreceiving voriconazole for over 6 months.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFifty-three paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, open-\nlabel, non-comparative, multi-center clinical trials. One study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven or \nprobable invasive aspergillosis (IA), of whom 14 patients had proven or probable IA and were included in \n\n\n\n26 \n\nthe MITT efficacy analyses. The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including \ncandidaemia (ICC), and esophageal candidiasis (EC) requiring either primary or salvage therapy, of whom \n17 were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. For patients with IA the overall rates of global response at 6 \nweeks were 64.3% (9/14), the global response rate was 40% (2/5) for patients 2 to <12 years and 77.8% (7/9) \nfor patients 12 to <18 years of age. For patients with ICC the global response rate at EOT was 85.7% (6/7) \nand for patients with EC the global response rate at EOT was 70% (7/10). The overall rate of response (ICC \nand EC combined) was 88.9% (8/9) for 2 to <12 years old and 62.5% (5/8) for 12 to <18 years old. \n \n \nClinical studies examining QTc interval \n \nA placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QTc interval of \nhealthy volunteers was conducted with three oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. The placebo-\nadjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of voriconazole were \n5.1, 4.8, and 8.2 msec, respectively and 7.0 msec for ketoconazole 800 mg. No subject in any group had an \nincrease in QTc of \u226560 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially \nclinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterised in healthy subjects, special populations and \npatients. During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of \naspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed \npharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non-linear \npharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. Greater than \nproportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, \nincreasing the oral dose from 200 mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily leads to a 2.5-fold increase in \nexposure (AUC\u03c4). The oral maintenance dose of 200 mg (or 100 mg for patients less than 40 kg) achieves a \nvoriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV. A 300 mg (or 150 mg for patients less than 40 kg) oral \nmaintenance dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. When the recommended intravenous or oral \nloading dose regimens are administered, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the \nfirst 24 hours of dosing. Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing \nwith steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by day 6 in the majority of subjects.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nVoriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voriconazole \nafter oral administration is estimated to be 96 %. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with \nhigh fat meals, Cmax and AUC\u03c4 are reduced by 34 % and 24 %, respectively. The absorption of voriconazole \nis not affected by changes in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive \ndistribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58 %. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from \neight patients in a compassionate programme showed detectable voriconazole concentrations in all patients.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nIn vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, \nCYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.  \n \nThe inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high.  \n \nIn vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This \nenzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15-20 % of Asian populations may be expected to be \npoor metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is 3-5 %. Studies \nconducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolisers have, on average, \n4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUC\u03c4) than their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts. \nSubjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolisers have on average 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure \nthan their homozygous extensive metaboliser counterparts.  \n \nThe major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72 % of the circulating \nradiolabelled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not contribute \nto the overall efficacy of voriconazole.  \n \nElimination \n \nVoriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2 % of the dose excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  \n \nAfter administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80 % of the radioactivity is \nrecovered in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83 % in the urine after multiple oral dosing. The \nmajority (> 94 %) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous \ndosing.  \n \nThe terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg (orally). \nBecause of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life is not useful in the prediction of the \naccumulation or elimination of voriconazole. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nGender \nIn an oral multiple dose study, Cmax and AUC\u03c4 for healthy young females were 83 % and 113 % higher, \nrespectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). In the same study, no significant differences in Cmax \nand AUC\u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (\u2265 65 years).  \n \nIn the clinical programme, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and \nplasma concentrations observed in male and female patients were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment \nbased on gender is necessary.  \n \nElderly  \nIn an oral multiple dose study Cmax and AUC\u03c4 in healthy elderly males (\u2265 65 years) were 61 % and 86 % \nhigher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in Cmax and AUC\u03c4 \nwere observed between healthy elderly females (\u2265 65 years) and healthy young females (18-45 years).  \n \nIn the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship between plasma \nconcentrations and age was observed. The safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly patients was \nsimilar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 4.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe recommended doses in children and adolescent patients are based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years and 26 \nimmunocompromised adolescent patients aged 12 to <17 years. Multiple intravenous doses of 3, 4, 6, 7 and \n8 mg/kg twice daily and multiple oral doses (using the powder for oral suspension) of 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and \n\n\n\n28 \n\n200 mg twice daily were evaluated in 3 paediatric pharmacokinetic studies. Intravenous loading doses of \n6 mg/kg IV twice daily on day 1 followed by 4 mg/kg intravenous dose twice daily and 300 mg oral tablets \ntwice daily were evaluated in one adolescent pharmacokinetic study. Larger inter-subject variability was \nobserved in paediatric patients compared to adults.  \n \nA comparison of the paediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted total \nexposure (AUC\u03c4) in children following administration of a 9 mg/kg IV loading dose was comparable to that \nin adults following a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose. The predicted total exposures in children following IV \nmaintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in adults following 3 and 4 mg/kg \nIV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in children following an oral maintenance dose of \n9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to that in adults following 200 mg oral twice \ndaily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a \n9 mg/kg oral dose.  \n \nThe higher intravenous maintenance dose in paediatric patients relative to adults reflects the higher \nelimination capacity in paediatric patients due to a greater liver mass to body mass ratio. Oral bioavailability \nmay, however, be limited in paediatric patients with malabsorption and very low body weight for their age. \nIn that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended.  \n \nVoriconazole exposures in the majority of adolescent patients were comparable to those in adults receiving \nthe same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some young adolescents \nwith low body weight compared to adults. It is likely that these subjects may metabolize voriconazole more \nsimilarly to children than to adolescents/adults. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 12- to 14-\nyear-old adolescents weighing less than 50 kg should receive children's doses (see section 4.2).  \n \nRenal impairment  \nIn patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine levels >2.5 mg /dl), accumulation of \nthe intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nHepatic impairment  \nAfter an oral single dose (200 mg), AUC was 233 % higher in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Protein binding of \nvoriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function.  \n \nIn an oral multiple dose study, AUC\u03c4 was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B) \ngiven a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal hepatic function given 200 mg \ntwice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies with voriconazole indicated the liver to be the target organ. Hepatotoxicity \noccurred at plasma exposures similar to those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, in common with other \nantifungal agents. In rats, mice and dogs, voriconazole also induced minimal adrenal changes. Conventional \nstudies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential did not reveal a special hazard for \nhumans.  \n \nIn reproduction studies, voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at \nsystemic exposures equal to those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the pre and postnatal \ndevelopment study in rats at exposures lower than those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses, \nvoriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labour and produced dystocia with consequent maternal \nmortality and reduced perinatal survival of pups. The effects on parturition are probably mediated by \nspecies-specific mechanisms, involving reduction of oestradiol levels, and are consistent with those observed \nwith other azole antifungal agents. Voriconazole administration induced no impairment of male or female \nfertility in rats at exposures similar to those obtained in humans at therapeutic doses.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPreclinical data on the intravenous vehicle, SBECD indicated that the main effects were vacuolation of \nurinary tract epithelium and activation of macrophages in the liver and lungs in the repeated-dose toxicity \nstudies. As GPMT (guinea pig maximisation test) result was positive, prescribers should be aware of the \nhypersensitivity potential of the intravenous formulation. Standard genotoxicity and reproduction studies \nwith the excipient SBECD reveal no special hazard for humans. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed \nwith SBECD. An impurity, present in SBECD, has been shown to be an alkylating mutagenic agent with \nevidence for carcinogenicity in rodents. This impurity should be considered a substance with carcinogenic \npotential in humans. In the light of these data the duration of treatment of the intravenous formulation should \nbe no longer than 6 months. \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Voriconazole Hikma is and what it is used for \n \nVoriconazole Hikma contains the active substance voriconazole. Voriconazole Hikma is an antifungal \nmedicine.  It works by killing or stopping the growth of the fungi that cause infections. \n \nIt is used for the treatment of patients (adults and children over the age of 2) with: \n\n\u2022 invasive aspergillosis (a type of fungal infection due to Aspergillus sp.), \n\u2022 candidaemia (another type of fungal infection due to Candida sp.) in non-neutropenic patients \n\n(patients without abnormally low white blood cell count), \n\u2022 serious invasive Candida sp.  infections when the fungus is resistant to fluconazole (another \n\nantifungal medicine), \n\u2022 serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium sp. or Fusarium sp. (two different species of \n\nfungi). \n \n\nVoriconazole Hikma is intended for patients with worsening, possibly life-threatening, fungal infections. \n \nPrevention of fungal infections in high risk bone marrow transplant recipients \nThis medicinal product should only be used under the supervision of a doctor. \n \n \n2.
