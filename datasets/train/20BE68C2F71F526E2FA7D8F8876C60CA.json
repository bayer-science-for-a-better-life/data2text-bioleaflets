PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n \nMoventig 12.5 mg film-coated tablet (tablet). \nOval, 10.5x5.5 mm, mauve tablet. \n \nMoventig 25 mg film-coated tablet (tablet). \nOval, 13x7 mm, mauve tablet. \n \nTablets are engraved with \u201cnGL\u201d on one side and the strength of the tablet on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMoventig is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to laxative(s).  \n \nFor definition of inadequate response to laxative(s), see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Moventig is 25 mg once daily. \n \nWhen naloxegol therapy is initiated, it is recommended that all currently used maintenance laxative \ntherapy should be halted, until clinical effect of naloxegol is determined. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is recommended based on age (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe starting dose for patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency is 12.5 mg. If side effects \nimpacting tolerability occur, naloxegol should be discontinued. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if \n\n\n\n3 \n\n12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see section 5.2). No dosage adjustment is required for patients \nwith mild renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Safety and \nefficacy have not been established in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Use in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nThe starting dose for patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil) is \n12.5 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients taking weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. alprazolam, \natorvastatin (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with cancer-related pain \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with cancer-related pain (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of naloxegol in children <18 years of age has not yet been established.   \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nOral use.  \n \nIt is recommended that Moventig is taken in the morning, for patient convenience to avoid bowel \nmovements in the middle of the night. \n \nMoventig should be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal of the day or \n2 hours after the first meal of the day. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet can be crushed to a powder and \nmixed in half a glass of water (120 ml) and drunk immediately. The glass should be rinsed with a \nfurther half glass of water (120 ml) and the contents drunk. Refer to section 6.6 for further information \non administration through a nasogastric tube. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or any other \nopioid antagonist. \n \nGastrointestinal obstruction \nPatients with known or suspected gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction or in patients at increased risk of \nrecurrent obstruction, due to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation (see section 4.4). \n \nConditions in patients with cancer pain \n\u2022 Patients with underlying cancer who are at heightened risk of GI perforation, such as those with:  \n\n\u2022 underlying malignancies of gastrointestinal tract or peritoneum \n\u2022 recurrent or advanced ovarian cancer  \n\u2022 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole or \ntelithromycin; protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir; grapefruit juice when \nconsumed in large quantities), see section 4.5. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConditions with increased potential for gastrointestinal perforation \nCases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in the post-marketing setting, including fatal \ncases when naloxegol was used in patients who were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) \nperforation. Naloxegol must not be used in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal \nobstruction or in patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, or in patients with underlying \ncancer who are at heightened risk of GI perforation (see section 4.3). \n \nCaution with regards to the use of naloxegol should be exercised in patients with any condition which \nmight result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. severe peptic ulcer disease, \nCrohn\u2019s Disease, active or recurrent diverticulitis, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies or \nperitoneal metastases). The overall benefit-risk profile for each patient should be taken into account. \nPatients should be advised to discontinue therapy with naloxegol and promptly notify their physician if \nthey develop unusually severe or persistent abdominal pain. \n \nClinically important disruptions of the blood-brain barrier \nNaloxegol is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist with restricted access to the central \nnervous system (CNS). The blood brain barrier integrity is important for minimizing naloxegol uptake \ninto the CNS. Patients with clinically important disruptions to the blood-brain barrier (e.g. primary \nbrain malignancies, CNS metastases or other inflammatory conditions, active multiple sclerosis, \nadvanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease etc.) were not included in clinical studies and may be at risk for \nnaloxegol entry into the CNS. Naloxegol should be prescribed with caution in such patients taking into \naccount their individual benefit-risk balance with observation for potential CNS effects, such as \nsymptoms of opioid withdrawal and/or interference with opioid-mediated analgesia. If evidence for \nopioid-mediated interference with analgesia or opioid withdrawal syndrome occurs, patients should be \ninstructed to discontinue Moventig and contact their physician. \n \nConcurrent methadone use \nPatients taking methadone as primary therapy for their pain condition were observed in clinical trials \nto have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as abdominal pain and \ndiarrhoea) than patients not receiving methadone. In a few cases, symptoms suggestive of opioid \nwithdrawal when taking naloxegol 25 mg were observed in patients taking methadone for their pain \ncondition. This was observed in a higher proportion of patients taking methadone than those not taking \nmethadone. Patients taking methadone for treatment of opioid addiction were not included in the \nclinical development programme and use of naloxegol in these patients should be approached with \ncaution.  \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \nReports of severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea have been observed in clinical trials with the 25 mg \ndose, typically occurring shortly after initiation of treatment. There was a higher incidence of \ndiscontinuations in patients taking the 25 mg dose compared to placebo due to diarrhoea (0.7% for \nplacebo versus 3.1% for naloxegol 25 mg) and abdominal pain (0.2% versus 2.9%, respectively). \nPatients should be advised to promptly report severe, persistent or worsening symptoms to their \nphysician. Consideration may be given to lowering the dose to 12.5mg in patients experiencing severe \ngastrointestinal adverse events depending upon the response and tolerability of individual patients. \n \nOpioid withdrawal syndrome \nCases of opioid withdrawal syndrome have been reported in the naloxegol clinical programme (DSM-\n5). Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a cluster of three or more of the following signs or symptoms: \ndysphoric mood, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, pupillary dilation, \n\n\n\n5 \n\npiloerection, sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever or insomnia. Opioid withdrawal syndrome typically \ndevelops within minutes to several days following administration of an opioid antagonist. If opioid \nwithdrawal syndrome is suspected the patient should discontinue Moventig and contact their \nphysician. \n \nPatients with CV conditions \nNaloxegol was not studied in the clinical trial programme in patients who had a recent history of \nmyocardial infarction within 6 months, symptomatic congestive heart failure, overt cardiovascular \n(CV) disease or patients with a QT interval of \u2265 500 msec. Moventig should be used with caution in \nthese patients. A QTc study performed with naloxegol in healthy volunteers did not indicate any \nprolongation of the QT interval. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nNaloxegol is not recommended in patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s Wort) (see section 4.5). \n \nFor information regarding concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors, see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5. \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe starting dose for patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency is 12.5 mg. If side effects \nimpacting tolerability occur, naloxegol should be discontinued. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if \n12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see section 5.2). \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNaloxegol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The use of naloxegol is not \nrecommended in such patients. \n \nCancer-related pain \nThere is limited clinical experience with the use of naloxegol in OIC patients with cancer-related pain. \nTherefore, caution should be used when prescribing naloxegol to such patients (see section 4.3). \n \nMoventig contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 12.5 mg / 25 mg tablet, that is \nto say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers \nInteraction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn an open-label, non-randomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover study to evaluate \nthe effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole on the single dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration of \nketoconazole and naloxegol resulted in a 12.9 fold (90% CI: 11.3-14.6) increase in naloxegol AUC \nand a 9.6-fold increase in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 8.1-11.3), compared to when naloxegol was \nadministered alone. Therefore, concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). Grapefruit juice has been classified as a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor when consumed in \nlarge quantities. No data are available on the concomitant use of naloxegol with grapefruit juice. \nConcomitant consumption of grapefruit juice while taking naloxegol should generally be avoided and \nconsidered only in consultation with a healthcare provider (see section 4.3). \n \nInteraction with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover study to evaluate \nthe effect of multiple doses of diltiazem on the single dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration of \ndiltiazem and naloxegol resulted in a 3.4-fold (90% CI: 3.2-3.7) increase in naloxegol AUC and a 2.9-\nfold increase in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 2.6-3.1), compared to when naloxegol was administered \nalone. Therefore, a dose adjustment of naloxegol is recommended when co-administered with \ndiltiazem and other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.2). The starting dose for patients \n\n\n\n6 \n\ntaking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is 12.5 mg once daily and the dose can be increased to 25 mg if \n12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see section 4.2). \n \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients taking weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n \nInteraction with strong CYP3A4 inducers \nIn an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, single-dose, crossover study \nto evaluate the effect of multiple doses of rifampin on the single dose PK of naloxegol, co-\nadministration of rifampin and naloxegol resulted in a 89% (90% CI: 88%-90%) decrease in naloxegol \nAUC and a 76% decrease in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 69%-80%), compared to when naloxegol was \nadministered alone. Therefore, Moventig is not recommended in patients who are taking strong \nCYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.4). \n \nInteraction with P-gp inhibitors \nA double-blind, randomized, 2-part, crossover, single centre study was conducted to evaluate the \neffect of quinidine on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol and the effect of the co-administration of \nnaloxegol and quinidine on morphine-induced miosis in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of the \nP-gp inhibitor quinidine resulted in a 1.4 fold increase in the AUC (90% CI: 1.3-1.5) and a 2.4 fold \nincrease in the Cmax (90% CI: 2.2-2.8) of naloxegol. Co-administration of naloxegol and quinidine did \nnot antagonize the morphine-induced miosis effect, suggesting that P-gp inhibition does not \nmeaningfully change the capacity of naloxegol to cross the blood-brain barrier at therapeutic doses. \n \nAs the effects of P-gp inhibitors on the PK of naloxegol were small relative to the effects CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, the dosing recommendations for Moventig when co-administered with medicinal products \ncausing both P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibition should be based on CYP3A4 inhibitor status - strong, \nmoderate or weak (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5).  \n \nInteraction with other opioid antagonists \nUse of naloxegol with another opioid antagonist (e.g. naltrexone, naloxone) should be avoided due to \nthe potential for an additive effect of opioid receptor antagonism and an increased risk of opioid \nwithdrawal. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of naloxegol in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity where systemic exposures were several times \nabove the therapeutic exposure level (see section 5.3).  \n \nThere is a theoretical potential for provoking opioid withdrawal in the foetus with use of an opioid \nreceptor antagonist in the mother, who is being treated with a concurrent opioid. Naloxegol use is \ntherefore not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether naloxegol is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in rats have \nshown naloxegol excreted in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nAt therapeutic doses, most opioids (e.g. morphine, meperidine, methadone) are excreted into breast \nmilk in minimal amounts. There is a theoretical possibility that naloxegol could provoke opioid \nwithdrawal in a breast-fed neonate whose mother is taking an opioid receptor agonist. Therefore, use \nin breast-feeding mothers is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \nThe effect of naloxegol on fertility in humans has not been studied. Naloxegol was found to have no \neffect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to 1,000 mg/kg per day (greater than \n1,000 times the human therapeutic exposure (AUC) at the recommended human dose of 25 mg/day). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMoventig has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn the pooled data from clinical trials the most commonly reported adverse reactions with naloxegol \n(\u2265 5%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and flatulence. The majority of \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions were graded as mild to moderate, occurred early in treatment and \nresolved with continued treatment. They were often reported as having a component of cramping \ndiscomfort.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency \ncategories are defined according to the following conventions: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions by System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClassification \n\n \nVery \n\nCommon \n \n\n \nCommon \n\n \n\n \nUncommon \n\n \n\n \nRare \n\n \n\n \nNot known \n \n\nInfections and \nInfestations \n \n\n Nasopharyngitis    \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n \n\n     \nHypersensitivity \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache Opioid \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \n\n  \n\n      \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal \npaina, \ndiarrhoea \n\nFlatulence, \nnausea, \nvomiting \n\n  Gastrointestinal \nperforation (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n      \nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Hyperhidrosis    \n\nNote: Selection of ADRs and their frequencies based on the 25 mg dose \na Reflects MedDRA Preferred Terms of: \u201cabdominal pain\u201d, \u201cabdominal pain upper\u201d, \u201cabdominal pain lower\u201d and \n\u201cgastrointestinal pain\u201d.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nOpioid withdrawal syndrome \nNaloxegol at therapeutic doses has minimal uptake across the blood brain barrier. In some patients, \nhowever, a constellation of symptoms has been reported, which resembles the syndrome of central \nopioid withdrawal. Most such reports were observed shortly after initial administration with the \nmedicinal product and were mild or moderate in intensity. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n  \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of naloxegol up to 1,000 mg were administered in healthy volunteers in clinical studies.  A \npotential CNS effect (reversal of opioid-induced miosis, as measured by pupillometry) was observed \nin 1 volunteer in the 250 mg group and 1 volunteer in the 1,000 mg group. In a clinical study of \npatients with OIC, a daily dose of 50 mg was associated with an increased incidence of intolerable \ngastrointestinal effects (primarily abdominal pain). \nNo antidote is known for naloxegol and dialysis was noted to be ineffective as a means of elimination \nin a clinical study in patients with renal failure. \n \nIf a patient on opioid therapy receives an overdose of naloxegol, the patient should be monitored \nclosely for potential evidence of opioid withdrawal symptoms or reversal of central analgesic effect. In \ncases of known or suspected overdose of naloxegol, symptomatic treatment as well as monitoring of \nvital functions should be performed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe use of naloxegol in the paediatric population has not been studied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for constipation, peripheral opioid receptor antagonists \nATC code: A06AH03 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nNaloxegol is a PEGylated derivative of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. PEGylation \nreduces naloxegol\u2019s passive permeability and also renders the compound a substrate for the \nP-glycoprotein transporter. Due to poorer permeability and increased efflux of naloxegol across the \nblood-brain barrier, related to P-gp substrate properties, the CNS penetration of naloxegol is minimal. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that naloxegol is a full neutral antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. \nNaloxegol acts by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the GI tract targeting the underlying causes of \nOIC (i.e. reduced GI motility, hypertonicity and increased fluid absorption resulting from long-term \nopioid treatment). \n \nNaloxegol functions as a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist in the gastrointestinal tract, \nthereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without impacting opioid-mediated analgesic \neffects on the central nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of naloxegol was established in two replicate double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies in patients with OIC and non-cancer related pain (Kodiac 4 and Kodiac 5). Patients taking a \nminimum of 30 morphine equivalent units (meu) of opioids per day for at least 4 weeks before \nenrolment and self-reported OIC were eligible. OIC was confirmed through a two week run in period \nand defined as < 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week on average with constipation \nsymptoms associated with at least 25% of bowel movements. Patients were prohibited from using \n\n\n\n9 \n\nlaxatives other than bisacodyl rescue laxative if they had not had a bowel movement for 72 hours. \nSBM was defined as a bowel movement without rescue laxative taken within the past 24 hours.  \nPatients with mean Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores equal to or higher than 7 were not studied \ndue to the risk of confounding the efficacy result as a result of uncontrolled pain. Patients who had a \nQTcF >500 msec at screening, had a recent history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before \nrandomization, had symptomatic congestive heart failure, or had any other overt CV disease were \nexcluded from the clinical studies. In a thorough QT/QTc study, as defined by the ICH E14 Guideline, \nthere were no clinically important changes in HR, RR, QT, PR or QRS intervals or T wave \nmorphology observed. In addition, no safety and tolerability concerns were identified in this study up \nto the highest dose given (150 mg). According to the ICH E14 Guideline, this is considered a \ndefinitively negative thorough QT/QTc study. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency \n(Child\u2019s-Pugh Class B or C) were excluded from the Phase III studies (Kodiac 4 and 5). Therefore, \nnaloxegol has not been studied in OIC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Both \nstudies were powered and stratified so that at least 50% of patients randomized to each treatment arm \nmet baseline criteria to be categorized as a laxative inadequate responder (LIR).   \n \nDefinition of laxative inadequate responder \nTo qualify as LIR, in the two weeks prior to first study visit patients had to have reported concurrent \nOIC symptoms of at least moderate severity while taking at least one laxative class for a minimum of \nfour days during the pre study period.   \n \nEfficacy in the patient population targeted in this SmPC \nResponse over 12 weeks in the LIR group \nEfficacy and durability of effect were measured in the primary end-point as response over the 12-week \ntreatment period to naloxegol as defined by > 3 SBMs per week and a change from baseline of > 1 \nSBM per week for at least 9 out of the 12 study weeks and 3 out of the last 4 weeks. The first of three \nmultiplicity protected secondary endpoints was the 12-week responder rate in the LIR subgroup. \n \nThere was a statistically significant difference for the 25 mg dose versus placebo for the LIR subgroup \nresponder rate in Kodiac 4 (p=0.002) and Kodiac 5 (p=0.014). Under multiplicity testing procedure, \nstatistical significance for the 12.5 mg treatment group versus placebo in the LIR subgroup was \nobserved in Kodiac 4 (p=0.028) but not in Kodiac 5 (p=0.074). In Kodiac 4, response rates in the \nplacebo, 12.5 mg and 25 mg groups in the LIR subgroup were 28.8%, 42.6% and 48.7%, while in \nKodiac 5, the corresponding response rates were 31.4, 42.4% and 46.8%. In the pooled data from \nKodiac 4 and Kodiac 5, responder rates in the LIR subgroup were 30.1% for placebo, 42.5% for the \n12.5 mg dose, and 47.7% for the 25 mg dose, with the relative risk (95% CI) for treatment effect \nversus placebo of 1.410(1.106, 1.797) and 1.584(1.253, 2.001) for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg groups, \nrespectively. \n \nResponse over 12 weeks in patients with an inadequate response to at least two classes of laxative \nResponse to naloxegol over 12 weeks was tested in the sub-group of patients with inadequate response \nto at least two laxative classes, approximately 20% of the patients randomized. In a pooled analysis of \nKodiac 4 and Kodiac 5 (90, 88 and 99 patients in the placebo, 12.5 mg and 25 mg groups \nrespectively), higher response rates in this population was observed for the 25 mg dose group \ncompared with placebo (p=0.040). The responder rates in this population were placebo 30.0%, \n12.5 mg 44.3% and 25 mg 44.4%. \n \nTime to first spontaneous bowel movement \nThe time to first SBM in the LIR subgroup after taking the first dose was shorter for the 25 mg dose as \ncompared to placebo in Kodiac 4 (p<0.001) and Kodiac 5 (p=0.002). The 12.5 mg dose in the LIR \nsubgroup also demonstrated shorter time to first post-dose SBM as compared to placebo in Kodiac 4 \n(p=0.002) and Kodiac 5 (p<0.001).  In Kodiac 4, placebo, 12.5 mg and 25 mg dose had median time to \nfirst post dose SBM of 43.4, 20.6, and 5.4 hours, respectively. In Kodiac 5 the corresponding times to \nfirst post dose SBM were 38.2, 12.8, and 18.1 hours, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nMean number of days per week with at least one SBM \nThere was an increase in the mean number of days per week with at least one SBM in the LIR \nsubgroup for the 25 mg dose in Kodiak 4 and Kodiac 5 (p<0.001 in both studies) and also for the \n12.5 mg dose (p=0.006 in both studies).  \n \nOIC symptom improvement \nThe 25 mg dose in the LIR subgroup improved rectal straining (Kodiac 4 p=0.043, Kodiac 5 p<0.001). \nStool consistency in the LIR subgroup as measured by the Bristol stool scale improved in Kodiac 5 \nversus placebo (p<0.001) but not in Kodiac 4 (p=0.156). The 25 mg dose in the LIR subgroup \nincreased mean days per week compared with placebo with at least 1 complete spontaneous bowel \nmovement (CSBM) in both studies (Kodiac 4 p=0.002, Kodiac 5 p<0.001). \n \nSymptom responder end-point \nA \u201csymptom responder\u201d was defined as meeting both the 12-week responder criteria and \ndemonstrating improvement in pre-specified OIC symptoms and no deterioration in symptoms. In the \nLIR subgroup, the 25 mg dose increased the symptom responder rates in both studies as compared to \nplacebo (Kodiac 4 p=0.001, Kodiac 5 p=0.005). The LIR subgroup symptom responder rates in \nKodiac 4 for placebo, 12.5 mg and 25 mg arms were 24.6%, 36.5% and 45.3% and the symptom \nresponder rates in Kodiac 5 were 25.6%, 33.6% and 42.7%. \n \nPatient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire \nNaloxegol 25 mg dose in the LIR subgroup resulted in a greater improvement (change from baseline) \nof patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) total scores compared with placebo in \nboth studies at 12 weeks (Kodiac 4 p=0.023, Kodiac 5 p=0.002). The 12.5 mg dose in the LIR \nsubgroup also resulted in greater improvement in total PAC SYM at week 12 compared with placebo \nin both studies (p= 0.020 and p=0.001 respectively). Naloxegol 25 mg dose, compared with placebo, \nalso resulted in greater improvement (change from baseline) of week 12 PAC-SYM rectal domain \nscores in both studies (p=0.004 and p<0.001, Kodiac 4 and 5, respectively) and for the stool domain \nscores in Kodiac 4 (p=0.031) and Kodiac 5 (p<0.001). There was no relevant impact on abdominal \nsymptoms in either study (p=0.256 and p=0.916, Kodiac 4 and 5, respectively). \n \nPotential for interference with opioid-mediated analgesia    \nThere were no clinically relevant differences between naloxegol 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and placebo in \naverage pain intensity, daily opioid dose or in opioid withdrawal scores over the 12-week study. \n \nIn the 12-week studies (Kodiac 4 and 5), the frequency of back pain AEs was 4.3% for naloxegol \n25 mg versus 2.0% for placebo, and the frequency of extremity pain AEs was 2.2% for naloxegol \n25 mg, versus 0.7% for placebo. In a long-term safety study (Kodiac 8), the frequency of AE reports \nof back pain was 8.9% for naloxegol 25 mg versus 8.8% for usual care.  For extremity pain, the rate \nfor naloxegol 25 mg was 3.5% versus 3.3% for usual care. \n \nSafety and tolerability over an extended 12-week period \nKodiac 7 was a 12-week safety extension that allowed for patients from Kodiac 4 to continue the same \nblinded treatment from Kodiac 4 for an additional 12 weeks (placebo, naloxegol 12.5 mg or \n25 mg daily). The primary objective was to compare safety and tolerability among the three treatment \ngroups for an additional 12 weeks (beyond that observed in Kodiac 4) using descriptive statistics. In \nthis study, naloxegol at doses of 12.5 mg and 25 mg was generally safe and well tolerated as compared \nwith placebo in the treatment of OIC patients with non-cancer-related pain. \n \nIn all treatment groups, including placebo, improvements in PAC-SYM domains observed in Kodiac 4 \nwere maintained for patients continuing in Kodiac 7. \n \nLong-term safety and tolerability \nKodiac 8 was a Phase III, 52-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, safety and \ntolerability study of naloxegol versus usual care in the treatment of OIC in patients with \nnon-cancer-related pain. The primary objective was to assess long-term safety and tolerability for \nnaloxegol 25 mg and to compare with usual care treatment using descriptive statistics. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nEligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either naloxegol 25 mg daily (qd) or usual \ncare treatment for OIC for 52 weeks. Patients assigned to usual care followed a laxative treatment \nregimen for OIC determined by the investigator according to best clinical judgment, excluding \nperipheral mu-opioid receptor antagonists.  \n \nOf the 844 patients who were randomized, 61.1% completed the study (defined as completing the \n2-week follow-up visit after the 52-week treatment period). Overall 393 and 317 patients had at least 6 \nand 12 months exposure to naloxegol 25 mg, respectively, in this study, which met the specified \nexposure requirements.  \n \nLong-term exposure to naloxegol 25 mg, up to 52 weeks, was generally safe and well tolerated in the \ntreatment of OIC patients with non-cancer-related pain.  During the 52-week treatment period there \nwere no important unexpected differences in the safety and tolerability findings between the naloxegol \n25 mg treatment group and the usual care treatment group. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMoventig in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in opioid induced constipation  (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration, naloxegol is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations (Cmax) \nachieved at less than 2 hours. In a majority of subjects, a secondary plasma concentration peak of \nnaloxegol was observed approximately 0.4 to 3 hours after the first peak. Enterohepatic recirculation \nmay be an explanation as extensive biliary excretion was seen in the rat. \n \nFood effects: A high-fat meal increased the extent and rate of naloxegol absorption. The Cmax and area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were increased by approximately 30% and 45%, \nrespectively. \n \nNaloxegol as a crushed tablet mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube \ninto the stomach, is bioequivalent to the whole tablet, with a median tmax of 0.75 and 1.50 hours (range \n0.23 to 5.02 hours) for the crushed tablet given orally and the crushed tablet given via NG tube, \nrespectively. \n \nDistribution \nThe mean apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F) in healthy volunteers \nranged from 968 to 2,140 L across dosing groups and studies. Results from a QWBA (Quantitative \nWhole Body Autoradiography) study in the rat and the lack of antagonism of CNS opiate effects in \nhumans at naloxegol doses less than 250 mg, indicate minimal distribution of naloxegol into the CNS. \nPlasma protein binding of naloxegol in humans was low and the fraction unbound ranged from 80% to \n100%. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn a mass balance study in humans, a total of 6 metabolites were identified in plasma, urine and faeces. \nThese metabolites represented more than 32% of the administered dose and were formed via \nN-dealkylation, O-demethylation, oxidation and partial loss of the PEG chain. None of the metabolites \nwere present in > 10% of the plasma concentrations of parent or total parent and metabolite related \nmaterial. \n \nElimination \nFollowing oral administration of radiolabelled naloxegol, 68% and 16% of total administered dose \nwere recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Parent naloxegol excreted in the urine accounted \nfor less than 6% of the total administered dose. Thus renal excretion is a minor clearance pathway for \n\n\n\n12 \n\nnaloxegol. In clinical pharmacology studies, the half-life of naloxegol at therapeutic dose ranged from \n6\u201311 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nAcross the range of doses evaluated peak plasma concentration and AUC increased in a dose-\nproportional, or approximately dose proportional, manner. \n \nSpecial populations \nAge and gender \nThere is a small effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol (approximately 0.7% increase in \nAUC for every year increase in age). No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. \nPatients over 65 years of age have been represented in the phase III studies. Clinical studies of \nnaloxegol did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years or over to determine whether \nthey respond differently than younger patients, however, based on the mode of action of the active \nsubstance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in this age group. \nFor dose recommendations for patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency, see section 4.2. \nThere is no gender effect on the PK of naloxegol. \n \nRace \nThe effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol is small (approximately 20% decrease in the \nAUC of naloxegol when other groups are compared to Caucasian) and, therefore, no dose adjustment \nis necessary. \n \nBody weight \nNaloxegol exposure was found to increase with increased weight, however, the differences in \nexposure were not considered clinically relevant. \n \nRenal impairment \nAs renal clearance is a minor route of elimination for naloxegol, regardless of severity (i.e. moderate, \nsevere and end stage renal failure), the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nnaloxegol was minimal in most subjects. However, in 2 out of 8 patients (in both the moderate and \nsevere renal impairment groups but not in the end stage renal failure group) up to 10-fold increases in \nthe exposure of naloxegol were observed. In these patients renal impairment may adversely affect \nother clearance pathways (hepatic/gut drug metabolism, etc.) resulting in higher exposure. The starting \ndose for patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency is 12.5 mg. If side effects impacting \ntolerability occur, naloxegol should be discontinued. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is \nwell tolerated by the patient (see section 4.2). Exposure of naloxegol in end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) patients on haemodialysis was similar to healthy volunteers with normal renal function. \n \nHepatic impairment \nLess than 20% decrease in AUC and 10% decrease in Cmax were observed in patients with mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). Effect of severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol was not evaluated. Use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment is not recommended.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of naloxegol in the paediatric population has not been studied. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and fertility. \n \nEmbryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits.  A potentially treatment-\nrelated increased incidence of the skeletal variant bipartite vertebral centrum and a single foetus with \nanorchism was seen at the highest dose tested in the rat embryo-foetal development study.  A possible \n\n\n\n13 \n\ntreatment-related foetal skeletal malformation of fused arches was noted at highest dose tested in the \nrabbit embryo-foetal development study, in the absence of maternal toxicity. In a separate pre- and \npost-natal development study in rats, body weights were lower for male pups following maternal \nadministration at the high dose. All these effects were observed only at exposures considered \nsufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.  \n \nCarcinogenicity studies of naloxegol were conducted in rats and mice.  In male rats, a dose-related \nincrease in Leydig cell adenomas and interstitial cell hyperplasia was observed at exposures \nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure.  The observed neoplastic changes \nare well known hormonal and centrally mediated effects in the rat which are not relevant for humans. \n \nStudies in suckling rats have shown that naloxegol is excreted in the milk. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Moventig is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Moventig  \n3. How to take Moventig  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Moventig  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Moventig is and what it is used for \n \nMoventig contains the active substance naloxegol. It is a medicine used in adults to treat constipation \nspecifically caused by pain medicines, called opioids, (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, tramadol, \ncodeine) taken on a regular basis. It is used when laxatives have not provided acceptable relief of \nconstipation. \n \nConstipation related to opioids can result in symptoms such as: \n\u2022 stomach pain  \n\u2022 rectal straining (having to push very hard to move the stool out of the rectum, which can also \n\ncause pain in the anus during pushing) \n\u2022 hard stools (stools which are hard \u201clike a rock\u201d) \n\u2022 incomplete emptying of the rectum (after having a bowel movement, the feeling as if a stool is \n\nstill in the rectum which needs to come out) \n \nIn patients taking opioids with constipation, who have tried at least one laxative and had incomplete \nrelief of constipation, Moventig has been shown in clinical trials to increase the number of bowel \nmovements and improve symptoms of constipation caused by opioids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Moventig  \n \nDo not take Moventig: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to naloxegol or similar medicines or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if your bowels are, or may be, blocked (obstructed) or you have been warned that your bowels \n\nare at risk of becoming blocked. \n\u2022 if you have cancer in your gut or \u2018peritoneum\u2019 (the lining of your stomach area), advanced  or \n\nrecurrent ovarian cancer or if you are taking medicines used to treat cancer such as \u201cVEGF \ninhibitors\u201d (e.g. bevacizumab). \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n\u2022 if you are taking certain other medicines such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (to treat fungal \ninfections), clarithromycin or telithromycin (antibiotics) or ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir (to \ntreat HIV).  \n\n \nDo not use Moventig if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before taking Moventig. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Moventig: \n\u2022 if you have stomach ulcers, Crohn\u2019s Disease (an illness where your gut is inflamed), \n\ndiverticulitis (another illness where your gut is inflamed), cancer in your gut or \u2018peritoneum\u2019 \n(the lining of your stomach area), or any conditon that might damage the wall of your bowel  \n\n\u2022 if you currently have unusually severe, persistent or worsening stomach pain  \n\u2022 if the natural protective barrier between the blood vessels in the head and in the brain is \n\ndamaged, for example if you have cancer in the brain or the central nervous system, or if you \nhave a disease of the central nervous system like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 \ncontact your doctor immediately if you experience lack of pain relief from your opioid medicine \nor symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome (see section 4).  \n\n\u2022 if you are taking methadone (see section below \u201cOther medicines and Moventig\u201d) \n\u2022 if you have had a heart attack within the last 6 months, have heart failure with daily shortness of \n\nbreath or other severe problems with your heart which cause daily symptoms \n\u2022 if you have kidney problems \u2013 your doctor may tell you to take a different dose (see section \n\nbelow \u201cHow to take Moventig\u201d)  \n\u2022 if you have severe liver illness  \n\u2022 if you have cancer-related pain \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking Moventig. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse whilst taking Moventig: \n\u2022 if you develop severe, persistent or worsening stomach pain. This could be a symptom of \n\ndamage to the wall of the gut and can be life-threatening.

constipation specifically caused by pain medicines, called opioids, (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, tramadol, codeine) taken on a regular basis. it is used when laxatives have not provided acceptable relief of constipation. constipation related to opioids can result in symptoms such as: stomach pain rectal straining (having to push very hard to move the stool out of the rectum, which can also cause pain in the anus during pushing) hard stools (stools which are hard \"like a rock\") incomplete emptying of the rectum (after having a bowel movement, the feeling as if a stool is still in the rectum which needs to come out) in patients taking opioids with constipation, who have tried at least one laxative and had incomplete relief of constipation, moventig has been shown in clinical
