NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal 4.3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne 10 ml vial of concentrate contains 43 mg irinotecan anhydrous free base (as irinotecan \nsucrosofate salt in a pegylated liposomal formulation).  \n \nOne ml of concentrate contains 4.3 mg irinotecan anhydrous free base (as irinotecan sucrosofate salt in \na pegylated liposomal formulation).  \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nOne ml of concentrate contains 0.144 mmol (3.31 mg) sodium. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nWhite to slightly yellow opaque isotonic liposomal dispersion. \nThe concentrate has a pH of 7.2 and an osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) \nand leucovorin (LV), in adult patients who have progressed following gemcitabine based therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (irinotecan) must only be prescribed and administered to patients by \nhealthcare professionals experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies. \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (irinotecan) is not equivalent to non-liposomal irinotecan \nformulations and should not be interchanged. \n \nPosology \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil should be administered sequentially. \nThe recommended dose and regimen of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is 70 mg/m2 intravenously \nover 90 minutes, followed by LV 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed \nby 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 intravenously over 46 hours, administered every 2 weeks. ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal should not be administered as a single agent. \n \nA reduced starting dose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (irinotecan) of 50 mg/m2 should be \nconsidered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nA dose increase of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal to 70 mg/m2 should be considered if tolerated in \nsubsequent cycles. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPre-medication \nIt is recommended that patients receive pre-medication with standard doses of dexamethasone (or an \nequivalent corticosteroid) together with a 5-HT3 antagonist (or other antiemetic) at least 30 minutes \nprior to ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal infusion. \n \nDosage adjustments \nAll dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. The LV dose does not require \nadjustment. For Grade 1 and 2 toxicities there are no dose modifications recommended. Dose \nadjustments, as summarised in Table 1 and Table 2, are recommended to manage \nGrade 3 or 4 toxicities related to ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \n \nFor patients who start treatment with 50 mg/m2 ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal and do not dose \nescalate to 70 mg/m2, the recommended first dose reduction is to 43 mg/m2 and the second dose \nreduction is to 35 mg/m2. Patients who require further dose reduction should discontinue treatment. \n \nPatients who are known to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28 and without drug related toxicities during \nthe first cycle of therapy (reduced dose of 50 mg/m2) may have the dose of ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal increased to a total dose of 70 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles based on individual patient \ntolerance. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications for ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV for \nGrade 3-4 toxicities for patients not homozygous for UGT1A1*28 \n \nToxicity grade (value) \nby NCI CTCAE v 4.01 \n \n\nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal /5-FU adjustment \n(for patients not homozygous for UGT1A1*28) \n\n \nHaematological toxicities \n\n \nNeutropenia \n \n\nA new cycle of therapy should not begin until the absolute neutrophil \ncount is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 \n \n\nGrade 3 or \nGrade 4 (< 1,000 \ncells/mm3) or \nNeutropenic fever \n\nFirst occurrence \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 50 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by 25% (1,800 mg/m2). \n\nSecond occurrence \n\nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 43 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by an additional 25% \n(1,350 mg/m2). \n\nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment  \nThrombocytopenia \n \nLeukopenia \n \n\nA new cycle of therapy should not begin until the platelet count is \n≥ 100,000 platelets/mm3 \nDose modifications for leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are based on \nNCI CTCAE toxicity grading and are the same as recommended for \nneutropenia above. \n \n\nNon haematological toxicities2 \n \nDiarrhoea A new cycle of therapy should not begin until diarrhoea resolves \n\nto ≤ Grade 1 (2-3 stools/day more than pre-treatment frequency). \n \n\nGrade 2 \n \n\nA new cycle of therapy should not begin until diarrhoea resolves \nto ≤ Grade 1 (2-3 stools/day more than pre-treatment frequency). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nToxicity grade (value) \nby NCI CTCAE v 4.01 \n \n\nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal /5-FU adjustment \n(for patients not homozygous for UGT1A1*28) \n\n \nGrade 3 or 4 \n First occurrence \n\nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 50 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by 25% (1,800 mg/m2) \n\nSecond occurrence \n\nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 43 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by an additional 25% \n(1,350 mg/m2) \n\nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment  \nNausea/vomiting A new cycle of therapy should not begin until nausea/vomiting resolves \n\nto ≤ Grade 1 or baseline \n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 (despite \nantiemetic therapy) First occurrence \n\nOptimise antiemetic therapy \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 50 mg/m2 \n\nSecond occurrence \nOptimise antiemetic therapy \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 43 mg/m2  \n\nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment  \nHepatic, renal, \nrespiratory or \nother2 toxicities \nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nA new cycle of therapy should not begin until the adverse reaction \nresolves to ≤ Grade 1 \n \n\nFirst occurrence \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 50 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by 25% (1,800 mg/m2) \n\nSecond occurrence \n\nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose \nto 43 mg/m2 \nReduce 5-FU dose by an \nadditional 25% (1,350 mg/m2) \n\nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment  \nAnaphylactic reaction \n \n\nFirst occurrence \n \n\nDiscontinue treatment \n \n\n1 NCI CTCAE v 4.0 = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nEvents version 4.0 \n\n2 Excludes asthenia and anorexia; Asthenia and Grade 3 anorexia do not require dose adjustment. \n \nTable 2: Recommended dose modifications for ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV for \nGrade 3-4 toxicities in patients homozygous for UGT1A1*28  \n \n\nToxicity grade (value)  \nby NCI CTCAE v 4.01  \n\nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal /5-FU adjustment \n(for patients homozygous for UGT1A1*28 without previous \n\nincrease3 to 70 mg/m2) \n\nAdverse reactions2 \nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nA new cycle of therapy should not begin until adverse event resolves \nto ≤ Grade 1 \n\nFirst occurrence \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose to \n43 mg/m2 \n5-FU dose modification as in Table 1 \n\nSecond occurrence \nReduce ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal dose to \n35 mg/m2 \n5-FU dose modification as in Table 1 \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment \n1 NCI CTCAE v 4.0 = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \n\nEvents version 4.0 \n2 Excludes asthenia and anorexia; asthenia and Grade 3 anorexia do not require dose adjustment. \n3 In case of a dose increase of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal to 70 mg/m2 if tolerated in \n\nsubsequent cycles, recommended dose modifications should follow Table 1.  \n \n\nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dedicated hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. The \nuse of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be avoided in patients with bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl, or \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 times upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) or > 5 times ULN if liver metastasis is present (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dedicated renal impairment study has been conducted with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. No \ndose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is not recommended for use in patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min). \n \nElderly \nForty-one percent (41%) of patients treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal across the clinical \nprogram were ≥ 65 years. No dose adjustment is recommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in children and adolescents aged ≤ 18 years \nhave not yet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is for intravenous use. The concentrate must be diluted prior to \nadministration and given as single intravenous infusion over 90 minutes. For more details see \nsection 6.6. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is a cytotoxic medicinal product. The use of gloves, goggles and \nprotective clothing when handling or administering ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is recommended. \nPregnant staff should not handle ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of severe hypersensitivity to irinotecan or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is a liposomal formulation of irinotecan with different \npharmacokinetic properties compared to non-liposomal irinotecan. The dose concentration and \nstrength are different in comparison to non-liposomal irinotecans. \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is not equivalent to other non-liposomal irinotecan formulations and \nshould not be interchanged. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIn the limited number of patients with prior exposure to non-liposomal irinotecan, no benefit of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal has been demonstrated. \n \nMyelosuppression/neutropenia \n \nComplete blood cell count monitoring is recommended during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \ntreatment. Patients should be aware of the risk of neutropenia and the significance of fever. The \nmedian time to nadir for ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia is 23 (range 8-104) days post first dose of treatment \nwith ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. Febrile neutropenia (body temperature > 38°C and neutrophil \ncount ≤ 1,000 cells/mm³) should be urgently treated in the hospital with broad-spectrum intravenous \nantibiotics. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be withheld if neutropenic fever occurs or the \nabsolute neutrophil count drops below 1,500 cells/mm3. Sepsis with neutropenic fever and consequent \nseptic shock with fatal outcome has been observed in patients with metastatic pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \nIn patients who experienced severe haematological events, a dose reduction or treatment \ndiscontinuation is recommended (see section 4.2). Patients with severe bone marrow failure should not \nbe treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \nHistory of prior abdominal radiation increases the risk of severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia \nfollowing ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment. Close monitoring of blood counts is \nrecommended, and the use of myeloid growth factors should be considered for patients with a history \nof abdominal radiation. Caution should be exercised in patients receiving concurrent administration of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal with irradiation. \n \nPatients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert’s syndrome, may be at \ngreater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \n \nCompared to Caucasian patients, Asian patients have an increased risk of severe and febrile \nneutropenia following treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nImmunosuppressive effects and vaccines \n \nAdministration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by \nchemotherapeutic medicinal products including ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal may result in serious \nor fatal infections; therefore vaccination with a live vaccine should be avoided. Killed or inactivated \nvaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. \n \nInteractions with strong CYP3A4 inducers \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should not be administered with strong CYP3A4-enzyme inducers \nsuch as anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine), rifampin, rifabutin and St. \nJohn’s wort unless there are no therapeutic alternatives. The appropriate starting dose for patients \ntaking these anticonvulsants or other strong inducers has not been defined. Consideration should be \ngiven to substituting with non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal therapy (see section 4.5). \n \nInteractions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong UGT1A1 inhibitors \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should not be administered with strong CYP3A4-enzyme inhibitors \n(e.g. grapefruit juice, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, \nritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be discontinued at \nleast 1 week prior to starting ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal therapy. \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should not be administered with strong UGT1A inhibitors \n(e.g. atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) unless there are no therapeutic alternatives. \n \nDiarrhoea \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nDiarrhoea can occur early (onset in ≤ 24 hours after starting ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal) or late \n(> 24 hours) (see section 4.8).  \nIn patients experiencing early diarrhoea, therapeutic and prophylactic atropine should be considered \nunless contraindicated. Patients should be made aware of the risk of delayed diarrhoea which can be \ndebilitating and, on rare occasions, life threatening since persistent loose or watery stools can result in \ndehydration, electrolyte imbalance, colitis, gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, infection or sepsis. \nAs soon as the first liquid stool occurs, the patient should start drinking large volumes of beverages \ncontaining electrolytes. Patients should have loperamide (or equivalent) readily available to begin \ntreatment for late diarrhoea. Loperamide should be initiated at first occurrence of poorly formed or \nloose stools or at the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. Loperamide \nshould be given until patient is without diarrhoea for at least 12 hours. \nIf diarrhoea persists while patient is on loperamide for more than 24 hours, adding oral antibiotic \nsupport (e.g. fluoroquinolone for 7 days) should be considered. Loperamide should not be used for \nmore than 48 consecutive hours due to risk of paralytic ileus. If diarrhoea persists for more \nthan 48 hours, stop loperamide, monitor and replace fluid electrolytes and continue antibiotic support \nuntil resolution for accompanying symptoms. \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment should be delayed until diarrhoea resolves \nto ≤ Grade 1 (2-3 stools/day more than pre-treatment frequency). ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \nmust not be administered to patients with bowel obstruction, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, \nuntil it is resolved. \nFollowing Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea, the subsequent dose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be \nreduced, (see section 4.2). \n \nCholinergic reactions \n \nEarly onset diarrhoea may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms such as rhinitis, increased \nsalivation, flushing, diaphoresis, bradycardia, miosis and hyperperistalsis. In case of cholinergic \nsymptoms atropine should be administered.  \n \nAcute infusion and related reactions \n \nInfusion reactions primarily consisting of rash, urticaria, periorbital oedema or pruritus were reported \nin patients receiving ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment. New events (all grade 1 or grade 2) \noccurred generally early during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment, with only 2 out \nof 10 patients noted with events after the fifth dose. Hypersensitivity reactions, including acute \ninfusion reaction may occur. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be discontinued in case of severe \nhypersensitivitiy reactions. \n \nPrior Whipple procedure \n \nPatients with a history of a Whipple procedure have a higher risk of serious infections following \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs of infections.  \n \nVascular disorders \n \nOnivyde pegylated liposomal has been associated with thromboembolic events such as pulmonary \nembolism, venous thrombosis and arterial thromboembolism. A thorough medical history should be \nobtained in order to identify patients with multiple risk factors in addition to the underlying neoplasm. \nPatients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and advised to \ncontact their physician or nurse immediately if any such signs or symptoms should occur. \n \nPulmonary toxicity \n \nInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)-like events leading to fatalities have occurred in patients receiving \nnon-liposomal irinotecan. No cases of ILD-like events have been reported with ONIVYDE pegylated \n\n\n\n8 \n\nliposomal therapy in clinical studies. Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of \npneumotoxic medicinal products, colony stimulating factors or having previously received radiation \ntherapy. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and \nduring ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal therapy. A reticulo-nodular pattern on chest X-ray was \nobserved in a small percentage of patients enrolled in a clinical study with irinotecan. New or \nprogressive dyspnoea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \ntreatment, pending diagnostic evaluation. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be discontinued in \npatients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with hyperbilirubinaemia had higher concentrations for total SN-38 (see section 5.2) and \ntherefore the risk of neutropenia is increased. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts should be \nconducted in patients with total bilirubin of 1.0-2.0 mg/dl. Caution should be exercised in patients with \nhepatic impairment (bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]; transaminases > 5 times ULN). \nCaution is required when ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is given in combination with other \nhepatotoxic medicinal products, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe use of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in patients with significant renal impairment has not been \nestablished (see section 5.2). \n \nUnderweight patients (body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2) \n \nIn the clinical study evaluating ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV, 5 of 8 underweight \npatients experienced a Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, mostly myelosuppression, while 7 of the \n8 patients required dose modification such as dose delay, dose reduction or dose discontinuation. \nCaution should be exercised when using ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in patients with body mass \nindex < 18.5 kg/m2. \n \nExcipients \n \nEach ml of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal contains 0.144 mmol (3.31 mg) sodium. This needs to be \ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInformation about drug interactions with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is referenced from the \npublished scientific literature for nonliposomal irinotecan. \n \nInteraction affecting the use of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inducers \nPatients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing \nanticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine have substantially reduced exposure to \nirinotecan (AUC reduction by 12% with St John’s wort, 57%-79% with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or \ncarbamazepine) and SN-38 (AUC reduction by 42% with St John’s wort, 36%-92% with phenytoin \nphenobarbital, or carbamazepine). Therefore, co-administration of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \nwith inducers of CYP3A4 may reduce systemic exposure of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and UGT1A1 inhibitors \nPatients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and \nUGT1A1 inhibitor, have increased SN-38 exposure by 109%. Therefore, co-administration of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. grapefruit juice, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelaprevir, voriconazole) may increase systemic exposure of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. Based \n\n\n\n9 \n\non the drug interaction of non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, co-administration of ONIVYDE \npegylated liposomal with other inhibitors of UGT1A1 (e.g. atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir, \nregorafenib) may also increase systemic exposure of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. \n \nCo-administration of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV does not alter the pharmacokinetics \nof ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nNo interaction of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (irinotecan) with other medicinal products is \nknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal treatment and 1 month thereafter. Males should use condoms during ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal treatment and 4 months thereafter. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data on the use of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in pregnant women. \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal can cause harm to the foetus when administered to the pregnant \nwoman, as the main ingredient irinotecan has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in \nanimals (see section 5.3). Therefore, based on results from animal studies and the mechanism of action \nof irinotecan, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary. If ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes \npregnant while receiving therapy, the patient should be informed about the potential hazard to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal or its metabolites are excreted into human \nmilk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal in \nbreast-feeding infants, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see \nsection 4.3). Patients should not breast-feed until one month after the last dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the impact of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal on human fertility. Non-liposomal \nirinotecan was shown to cause atrophy of male and female reproductive organs after multiple daily \nirinotecan doses in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nDuring treatment patients should observe caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe following adverse reactions, considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, were reported in 264 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the \npancreas, 147 of whom received ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal monotherapy (100 mg/m2) \nand 117 received ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (70 mg/m2) in combination with 5-FU/LV. \nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV \nwere: diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, neutropenia, fatigue, asthenia, anaemia, \n\n\n\n10 \n\nstomatitis and pyrexia. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) of ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal therapy were diarrhoea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, nausea, pyrexia, sepsis, dehydration, \nseptic shock, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. \nThe rates of adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were 11% for the \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV arm and 12% for the monotherapy arm. \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were infection and diarrhoea \nfor ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV arm, and vomiting and diarrhoea for the monotherapy \narm. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions that may occur during treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal are \nsummarised below and are presented by system organ class and frequency category (Table 3). Within \neach system organ class and frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. Frequencies categories used for adverse reactions are: very common (≥ 1/10); common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)**. \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal therapy in the \nNAPOLI-1 clinical study \n \n\nMedDRA* system organ \nclass Adverse reaction frequency** \n\nInfections and infestations Common: Septic shock, Sepsis, Pneumonia, Febrile neutropenia, \nGastroenteritis, Oral candidiasis \nUncommon: Biliary sepsis \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common: Neutropenia, Leukopenia, Anaemia, \nThrombocytopenia \nCommon: Lymphopenia \n \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon: Hypersensitivity \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common: Hypokalaemia, Hypomagnesaemia, Dehydration, \nDecreased appetite \nCommon: Hypoglycaemia, Hyponatraemia, Hypophosphataemia \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common: Insomnia \n \n\nNervous system disorders Very common: Dizziness \nCommon: Cholinergic syndrome, Dysgeusia \n \n\nCardiac disorders Common: Hypotension \n \n\nVascular disorders Common: Pulmonary embolism, Embolism, Deep vein thrombosis \nUncommon: Thrombosis \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: Dyspnoea, Dysphonia \nUncommon: Hypoxia \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Nausea, Abdominal pain, \nStomatitis \nCommon: Colitis, Haemorrhoids \nUncommon: Oesophagitis, Proctitis \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common: Hypoalbuminaemia \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nMedDRA* system organ \nclass Adverse reaction frequency** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: Alopecia \nUncommon: Rash maculo-papular, Nail discolouration \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common: Acute renal failure \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common: Pyrexia, Peripheral oedema, Mucosal inflammation, \nFatigue, Asthenia \nCommon: Infusion related reaction, Oedema \n \n\nInvestigations Very common: Weight decrease \nCommon: Increased bilirubin, Increased alanine aminotransferase, \nIncreased aspartate aminotransferase, Increased international \nnormalised ratio \n \n\n* MedDRA version 14.1 \n** Rare occurrence cannot be estimated from the NAPOLI-1study due to the small sample size \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions were observed in the NAPOLI-1 clinical study: \n \nMyelosuppression \nMyelosuppression (neutropenia/leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and, anaemia) was more common in \nthe ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV arm compared to the 5-FU/LV control arm. \n \nNeutropenia/leukopenia \nNeutropenia/leukopenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity. Grade 3 or higher \nneutropenia occurred more frequently in patients treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n+5-FU/LV (27.4%) compared to patients treated with 5-FU/LV (1.5%). Neutropenic fever/sepsis \nappeared more frequently in the ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV combination arm \n[in 4 patients (3.4%)] compared to 5-FU/LV control arm [in 1 patient (0.7%)]. \n \nThrombocytopenia \nGrade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal +5-FU/LV and 0% in patients treated with 5-FU/LV. \n \nAnaemia \nGrade 3 or higher anaemia occurred in 10.3% of patients treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n+5-FU/LV and in 6.7% of patients treated with 5-FU/LV. \n \nAcute renal failure \nRenal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who become volume \ndepleted from nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Acute renal failure was reported in 6 of 117 patients \n(5.1%) in the ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV arm, 10 of 147 (6.8%) in the ONIVYDE \npegylated liposomal monotherapy arm and 6 of 134 patients (4.5%) in the 5-FU/LV arm. \n \nDiarrhoea and related adverse reactions \nDiarrhoea is a very common adverse reaction leading to colitis, ileus, gastroenteritis, fatigue, \ndehydration, weight loss, renal toxicities, hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia. Renal impairment and \nacute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe \nvomiting and/or diarrhoea. In the clinical study Grade 3 or Grade 4 diarrhoea occurred in 15 out \nof 117 patients (12.8%) receiving ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV. For patients \nexperiencing late diarrhoea, the median time to late diarrhoea onset was 8 days from the previous dose \nof ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. Early onset diarrhoea, typically appearing ≤ 24 hours after dose \n\n\n\n12 \n\nadministration, can occur and is usually transient. Early onset diarrhoea may also be accompanied by \ncholinergic symptoms that can include rhinitis, increased salivation, flushing, diaphoresis, \nbradycardia, miosis and hyperperistalsis that can induce abdominal cramping. In the clinical study, \nearly diarrhoea onset occurred in 35 patients (29.9%) and cholinergic events occurred in 4 patients \n(3.4%) receiving ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV. \nWithhold ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal for Grade 2-4 diarrhoea and initiate treatment for diarrhoea. \nFollowing recovery to Grade 1 diarrhoea, resume ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal at a reduced dose \n(see section 4.2). \n \nInfusion reaction \nAcute infusion reactions were reported in 8 of 117 patients (6.8%) in the ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal +5-FU/LV arm, 3 of 147 patients (2.0%) in the ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \nmonotherapy arm, and 8 of 134 patients (6.0%) in the 5-FU/LV arm. \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly \nOverall, no major clinical differences in safety or efficacy were reported between patients ≥ 65 years \nand patients < 65 years, although a higher frequency of discontinuation (14.8% vs 7.9%) was noted in \nthe former group treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV in the NAPOLI-1 study and \nin some cases the adverse reactions did not resolve. Grade 3 or higher and serious treatment emergent \nadverse reactions were more frequent in patients < 65 years (84.1% and 50.8%) compared to \npatients ≥ 65 years (68.5 % and 44.4%). Conversely, patients > 75 years (n=12) experienced more \nfrequent serious adverse reactions, dose delay, dose reduction and discontinuation compared to \npatients ≤ 75 years (n=105) when treated with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV in the \npancreatic adenocarcinoma study. \n \nAsian population \nCompared to Caucasians, Asian patients were observed with a lower incidence of diarrhoea \n[14 (19.2%) out of 73 Caucasians had a ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea, and 1 out of 33 (3.3%) Asians had a \n≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea], but a higher incidence and higher severity of neutropenia. In patients receiving \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV, the incidence of ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia was higher among \nAsian patients [18 of 33 (55%)] compared to Caucasians patients [13 of 73 (18%)]. Neutropenic \nfever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian patients compared to 1% of Caucasians patients. \nThis is consistent with the population pharmacokinetic analysis that showed a lower exposure to \nirinotecan and a higher exposure to its active metabolite SN-38 in Asians than in Caucasians. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn clinical studies of non-liposomal irinotecan administered on a weekly dosage schedule, patients \nwith modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dl) had a significantly \ngreater likelihood of experiencing first cycle Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin \nlevels that were less than 1.0 mg/dl. \n \nPatients with prior Whipple procedure \nIn the clinical study evaluating ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV, patients with a prior \nWhipple procedure had a higher risk of serious infections following treatment with ONIVYDE \npegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV [9 of 29 (30%)] compared to 11 of 88 (12.5%) patients with no prior \nWhipple procedure. \n \nPatients with UGT1A1 allele \nIndividuals who are 7/7 homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia \nfrom non-liposomal irinotecan. In the clinical study evaluating ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n+5-FU/LV, the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia in these patients [2 of 7 (28.6%)] was similar to \nthe frequency in patients not homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele who received a starting dose of \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal of 70 mg/m2 [30 of 110 (27.3%)] (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nUnderweight patients (body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2) \nIn the clinical study evaluating ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV, 5 of 8 underweight \npatients experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction, mostly myelosuppression, while 7 of \nthe 8 patients required dose modification such as dose delay, dose reduction or dose discontinuation \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical trials, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal was administered at doses up to 210 mg/m2 to \npatients with various cancers. The adverse reactions in these patients were similar to those reported \nwith the recommended dosage and regimen. \n \nThere have been reports of overdosage with non-liposomal irinotecan at doses up to approximately \ntwice the recommended therapeutic dose of irinotecan, which may be fatal. The most significant \nadverse reactions reported were severe neutropenia and severe diarrrhoea. \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. Maximum supportive \ncare should be instituted to prevent dehydration due to diarrhoea and to treat any infectious \ncomplications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX19 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe active substance in ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor) \nencapsulated in a lipid bilayer vesicle or liposome. \n \nIrinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins act as specific inhibitors of the enzyme \nDNA topoisomerase I. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind reversibly to the \ntopoisomerase I-DNA complex and induce single-strand DNA lesions which block the DNA \nreplication fork and are responsible for the cytotoxicity. Irinotecan is metabolized by carboxylesterase \nto SN-38. SN-38 is approximately 1,000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase \nI purified from human and rodent tumour cell lines. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn animal models, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal has been shown to extend plasma levels of \nirinotecan and prolong the exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 at the site of the tumour. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal were investigated in a multinational, \nrandomised, open label, controlled clinical trial (NAPOLI–1) that tested two treatment regimens for \npatients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had documented disease progression after \ngemcitabine or gemcitabine-containing therapy. The trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\nand safety of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal monotherapy or ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n+5-FU/LV compared to an active control arm of 5-FU/LV. \n \nPatients randomised to ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV received ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal at 70 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, followed by \nLV 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 intravenously \nover 46 hours, administered every 2 weeks. Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele were \ngiven a lower initial dose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal (see section 4.2). Patients randomised \nto 5-FU/LV received leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed \nby 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 intravenously over 24 hours, administered on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 6 week \ncycle. Patients randomised to ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal monotherapy received 100 mg/m2 as an \nintravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 3 weeks. \n \nKey eligibility criteria for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the \nNAPOLI-1 clinical study were Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70, normal bilirubin level, \ntransaminase levels ≤ 2.5 times the ULN or ≤ 5 times the ULN for patients with liver metastases and \nalbumin ≥ 3.0 g/dl. \n \nA total of 417 patients were randomised to the ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV \narm (N=117), ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal monotherapy arm (N=151) and 5-FU/LV arm (N=149). \nPatient demographic and entry disease characteristics were well balanced between trial arms. \n \nIn the intent to treat (all randomised) population, the median age was 63 years \n(range 31-87 years), 57 % were males, and 61% were Caucasian and 33% were Asian. Mean baseline \nalbumin level was 3.6 g/dl, and baseline KPS was 90-100 in 55% of patients. Disease characteristics \nincluded 68% of patients with liver metastases and 31% with lung metastases; 12% of patients had no \nprior lines of metastatic therapy, 56 % of patients had 1 prior line of metastatic therapy, 32% of \npatients had 2 or more prior lines of metastatic therapy. \n \nPatients received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome \nmeasure was Overall Survival (OS). Additional outcome measures included Progression Free Survival \n(PFS) and Objective Response Rate (ORR). Results are shown in Table 4.

Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jun 15;12:3782-91] \n \nDistribution \n \nDirect measurement of liposomal irinotecan shows that 95% of irinotecan remains \nliposome-encapsulated during circulation. Non-liposomal irinotecan displays a large volume of \ndistribution (138 l/m2). The volume of distribution of ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal 70 mg/m2 was 2.6 l/m2, which suggests that ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is largely \nconfined to vascular fluid. \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe plasma protein binding of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is negligible (< 0.44% of total \nirinotecan in ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal). The plasma protein binding of non-liposomal \nirinotecan is moderate (30% to 68%), and SN-38 is highly bound to human plasma proteins \n(approximately 95%). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIrinotecan released from liposome encapsulation follows a similar metabolic pathway reported with \nnon-liposomal irinotecan. \nThe metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is mediated by carboxylesterase \nenzymes. In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN-38 and another metabolite aminopentane \ncarboxylic acid (APC) do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 isozymes. SN-38 is subsequently conjugated \npredominantly by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide \nmetabolite. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to \nreduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. In the population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis in patients with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal using the results of a subset with \nUGT1A1*28 genotypic testing, in which the analysis adjusted for the lower dose administered to \npatients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, patients homozygous (N=14) and non-homozygous \n(N=244) for this allele had total SN-38 average steady-state concentrations of 1.06 and 0.95 ng/ml, \nrespectively. \n \nElimination \n \nThe disposition of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal and non-liposomal irinotecan has not been fully \nelucidated in humans. \nThe urinary excretion of non-liposomal irinotecan is 11% to 20%; SN-38 < 1%; and \nSN-38 glucuronide is 3%. The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its \nmetabolites (SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 hours following administration of \nnon-liposomal irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately 25% (100 mg/m2) to 50% \n(300 mg/m2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, mild-to-moderate renal impairment had no effect on the \nexposure of total SN-38 after adjusting for BSA. The analysis included 68 patients with moderate \n(CLcr 30-59 ml/min), 147 patients with mild (CLcr 60-89 ml/min) renal impairment, and 135 patients \nwith normal renal function (CLcr > 90 ml/min). There was insufficient data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min) to assess its effect on pharmacokinetics (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, patients with baseline total bilirubin concentrations of 1-2 mg/dl \n(n=19) had average steady state concentrations for total SN-38 that were increased \nby 37% (0.98 [95%CI: 0.94-1.02] and 1.29 [95%CI: 1.11-1.5] ng/ml, respectively) compared to \npatients with baseline bilirubin concentrations of < 1 mg/dl (n=329); however, there was no effect of \nelevated ALT/AST concentrations on total SN-38 concentrations. No data are available in patients \nwith total bilirubin more than 2 times the ULN. \n \nOther special populations \n \nAge and gender \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients aged 28 to 87 years, of whom 11% were \n≥75 years suggests that age had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure to irinotecan and \nSN-38. \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis in 196 male and 157 female patients suggests that gender \nhad no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 after adjusting for body \nsurface area (BSA). \n \nEthnicity \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that Asians have 56% lower total irinotecan average \nsteady state concentration (3.93 [95%CI: 3.68-4.2] and 1.74 [95%CI: 1.58-1.93] mg/l, respectively) \nand 8% higher total SN-38 average steady state concentration (0.97 [95%CI: 0.92-1.03] \nand 1.05 [95%CI: 0.98-1.11] ng/ml, respectively) than Caucasians. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nIn a pooled analysis from 353 patients, higher plasma SN-38 Cmax was associated with increased \nlikelihood of experiencing neutropenia, and higher plasma total irinotecan Cmax was associated with \nincreased likelihood of experiencing diarrhoea. \n \nIn the clinical trial demonstrating effectiveness of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, higher plasma \nexposures of total irinotecan and SN-38 for patients in the ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal +5-FU/LV \ntreatment arm were associated with longer OS and PFS as well as with higher ORR (objective \nresponse rate). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn single and repeated dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs, the target organs of toxicity were \nthe gastrointestinal tract and the hematologic system. The severity of effects was dose-related and \nreversible. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in rats and dogs following 90 min \nintravenous infusion of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal once every 3 weeks for 18 weeks was  \n155 mg/m2. \nIn safety pharmacology studies in dogs, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal had no effect on \ncardiovascular, hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, or respiratory parameters at doses up to 18 mg/kg \nor 360 mg/m2  . No findings indicative of CNS related toxicity were observed in the repeated dose \ntoxicity studies in rats. \n \nGenotoxic and carcinogenic potential \n \nNo genotoxicity studies have been performed with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. Non-liposomal \nirinotecan and SN-38 were genotoxic in vitro in the chromosomal aberration test on CHO-cells as well \nas in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice. However, in other studies with irinotecan they have been \nshown to be devoid of any mutagenic potential in the Ames test. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal. For \nnon-liposomal irinotecan, in rats treated once a week during 13 weeks at the maximum dose \nof 150 mg/m², no treatment related tumours were reported 91 weeks after the end of treatment. Under \nthese conditions, there was a significant linear trend with dose for the incidence of combined uterine \nhorn endometrial stromal polyps and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Due to its mechanism of action, \nirinotecan is considered a potential carcinogen. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nNo reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been performed with ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal. \nNon-liposomal irinotecan was teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses below the human therapeutic \ndose. In rats, pups born from treated animals and having external abnormalities showed a decrease in \nfertility. This was not seen in morphologically normal pups. In pregnant rats there was a decrease in \nplacental weight and in the offspring a decrease in foetal viability and increase in behavioural \nabnormalities. \n\n\n\n19 \n\nNon-liposomal irinotecan caused atrophy of male reproductive organs both in rats and dogs after \nmultiple daily doses of 20 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively.These effects were reversible upon \ncessation of treatment. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is and what it is used for \n \nWhat ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is and how it works \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance irinotecan. \nThis active substance is held in tiny lipid (fatty) particles called liposomes. \n \nIrinotecan belongs to a group of cancer medicines called ‘topoisomerase inhibitors’. It blocks an \nenzyme called topoisomerase I, which is involved in the division of cell DNA. This prevents the \ncancer cells from multiplying and growing, and they eventually die. \n \nThe liposomes are expected to accumulate within the tumour and release the medicine slowly over \ntime, thereby allowing it to act for longer. \n \nWhat ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used for \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used to treat adult patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer \n(cancer of the pancreas that has already spread elsewhere in the body) whose previously cancer \ntreatment included a medicine called gemcitabine. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used in \ncombination with other cancer medicines, called 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. \n \nIf you have any questions about how ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal works or why this medicine has \nbeen prescribed for you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n \nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. They may differ from the general \ninformation contained in this leaflet. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nDo not use ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n \n- if you have a history of a severe allergy to irinotecan, or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are breastfeeding \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n- if you have ever had any liver problems or jaundice \n- if you have ever had lung disease or have previously received medicines (colony stimulating \n\nfactors) to increase your blood count or radiation therapy \n- if you are taking other medicines (see section “Other medicines and ONIVYDE pegylated \n\nliposomal”) \n- if you are planning to have a vaccination as many vaccinations must not be given during \n\nchemotherapy \n- if you are on a controlled sodium diet as this medicine contains sodium. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse immediately during treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n- if you feel sudden shortness of breath, flushing, headache, skin rash or hives (itchy rash with \n\nswollen red bumps on the skin that appear suddenly), itching, swelling around the eyes, \ntightness in the chest or throat during or shortly after your infusion \n\n- if you experience fever, chills or other symptoms of infection \n- if you get diarrhoea with frequent liquid stools and cannot control this after 12 to 24 hours of \n\ntreatment (see below) \n- if you get breathlessness or cough.  \n- if you experience signs or symptoms of a blood clot, like sudden pain and swelling in a leg or an \n\narm, sudden onset of coughing, chest pain or difficulty breathing. \n \nWhat to do in case of diarrhoea \n \nAs soon as the first liquid stool occurs, start drinking large volumes ofrehydration fluids (е.g. water, \nsoda water, fizzy drinks, soup) to avoid losing too much liquid and salts from your body. Contact your \ndoctor immediately to give you a suitable treatment. Your doctor may give you a medicine which \ncontains loperamide to begin treatment at home but it must not be used for longer than 48 consecutive \nhours. If loose stools persist, contact your doctor. \n \nBlood tests and medical examinations \n \nBefore you start treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, your doctor will perform blood tests \n(or other medical examinations) to determine the best starting dose for you. You will need to have \nfurther (blood or other) tests during treatment so that your doctor can monitor your blood cells and \nassess how you are responding to the treatment. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose or stop \ntreatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age \nof 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nIt is especially important that you tell your doctor if you have been given irinotecan in any form \nearlier. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal must not be used instead of other medicines containing irinotecan \nbecause it behaves differently when it is contained in the liposomes than when it is given in its free \nform. \n \nIt is also especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking the following medicines, \nsince they reduce the availability of irinotecan in your body: \n- phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine (medicines used to treat convulsions and falls) \n- rifampicin and rifabutin (medicines used to treat tuberculosis) \n- St. John´s wort (a plant based medicine used to treat depression and low mood) \n- as ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should not be given to you together with these medicines. \n \nIt is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking the following medicines, since \nthey increase the availability of irinotecan in your body: \n- ketoconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole (medicines used to treat fungal infections) \n- clarithromycin (an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections) \n- indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, atazanavir (medicines against HIV \n\ninfection)  \n- regorafenib (a medicine used to treat certain forms of cancer) \n- telaprevir (a medicine used to treat a liver disease called hepatitis C) \n- nefazodone (a medicine used to treat depression, low mood) \n- gemfibrozil (medicine used to treat high fat levels in the blood) \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal with food and drink \n \nAvoid eating grapefruits and drinking grapefruit juice while you are receiving ONIVYDE pegylated \nliposomal as it may increase the availability of the active substance of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \nin your body. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nYou should not be given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal if you are pregnant as it may harm the baby. \nTell your doctor if you are or think you may be pregnant. Ask your doctor for advice if you are \nplanning to have a baby. If you are given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal you should not breast-feed \nuntil one month after the last dose. \n \nDuring your ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment and one month after you should choose an \neffective birth control method which suits you, to prevent pregnancy in this period of time. Males \nshould use condoms during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment and 4 months thereafter. \n \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You must not be given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal if \nyou are breast-feeding as this may be harmful to your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal may influence your ability to drive and use machines (as you may be \nsleepy, dizzy and exhausted with the use of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal). You should avoid \ndriving, using machines or performing other tasks that need full attention if you feel sleepy, dizzy and \nexhausted. \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal contains sodium \n \nOne millilitre of this medicine contains 0.144 mmol (3.31 mg) sodium—keep this in mind if you are \non a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n3. How ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used \n \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in giving \nanticancer medicines \nCarefully follow all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse. \n \nYour doctor will decide upon the doses you will receive. \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein, which should take at \nleast 90 minutes and should be given as a single dose. \nAfter you have been given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal you will be given two other medicines, \nleucovorin and 5-fluorouracil. \nThe treatment will be repeated every two weeks. \n \nIn certain cases, lower doses or longer dosing intervals may be required. \n \nYou may receive pre-medication against nausea and vomiting. If you have experienced sweating, \nabdominal cramping and salivation together with early frequent and liquid stools in previous \ntreatments with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, you may receive additional medicines before \nONIVYDE pegylated liposomal to prevent or reduce this in the following treament cycles. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Dilute with 5% glucose solution for \ninjection or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to prepare a dispersion of the \nappropriate dose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal diluted to a final volume of 500 ml. Mix \ndiluted solution by gentle inversion. \n\n• ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should be administered before leucovorin followed \nby 5-fluorouracil. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal must not be administered as a bolus injection \nor an undiluted solution. \n\n• Aseptic techniques must be followed during the preparation of the infusion. ONIVYDE \npegylated liposomal is for single use only. \n\n• From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used as soon as possible after \ndilution. The diluted solution for infusion can be stored at ambient temperature (15°C to 25°C) \nfor up to 6 hours or in the refrigerator (2ºC - 8ºC) for no more than 24 hours prior to use. It must \nbe protected from light, and it must not be frozen. \n\n• Care should be taken to avoid extravasation, and the infusion site should be monitored for signs \nof inflammation. Should extravasation occur, flushing the site with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection and/or sterile water and applications of ice are recommended. \n\n \nHow to handle and dispose of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal \n \n• ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is a cytotoxic medicinal product and caution should be \n\nexercised in handling it. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing when handling or \nadministering ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is recommended. If the solution contacts the \nskin, the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If the solution \ncontacts mucous membranes, they should be flushed thoroughly with water. Pregnant staff \nshould not handle ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal considering the cytotoxic nature of the \nmedicinal product. \n\n• Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n38 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n\n\n39 \n\nScientific conclusions \n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for irinotecan (liposomal \nformulations), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n\nIn view of available data on the drug-drug interaction between irinotecan and an UGT1A1 inhibitor, \nregorafenib, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing irinotecan \n(liposomal formulations) should be amended accordingly.  \n\nUpdate of section 4.5 of the SmPC to add regorafenib to the list of examples of UGT1A1 inhibitors. \nThe Package leaflet is updated accordingly. The MAH also took the occasion to align the PI to QRD \nversion 10.1. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for irinotecan (liposomal formulations) the CHMP is of the \nopinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing irinotecan (liposomal \nformulations) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
