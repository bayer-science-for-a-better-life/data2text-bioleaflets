NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nWilzin 25 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 25 mg of zinc (corresponding to 83.92 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate). \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nHard capsule. \n\nCapsule with aqua blue opaque cap and body, imprinted \"93-376\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of Wilson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nWilzin treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment \n\nof Wilson\u2019s disease (see section 4.4). Wilzin is a life-long therapy. \n\n \n\nThere is no difference in dose between symptomatic and presymptomatic patients. \n\nWilzin is available in hard capsules of 25 mg or 50 mg. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Adults: \nThe usual dose is 50 mg 3 times daily with a maximum dose of 50 mg 5 times daily. \n\n\uf0b7 Children and adolescents: \nData are very limited in children under 6 years but since the disease is fully penetrant, \n\nprophylactic treatment should be considered as early as possible. The recommended dose is as \n\nfollows: \n\n- from 1 to 6 years: 25 mg twice daily \n\n- from 6 to 16 years if bodyweight under 57 kg: 25 mg three times daily \n\n- from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 50 mg three times daily. \n\n\uf0b7 Pregnant women: \nA dose of 25 mg 3 times daily is usually effective but the dose should be adjusted to copper \n\nlevels (see section 4.4 and section 4.6). \n\n \n\nIn all cases, dose should be adjusted according to therapeutic monitoring (see section 4.4.). \n\n \n\nWilzin must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. In case of \n\ngastric intolerance, often occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be delayed to mid-morning, \n\nbetween breakfast and lunch. It is also possible to take Wilzin with a little protein, such as meat (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn children who are unable to swallow capsules, these should be opened and their content suspended in \n\na little water (possibly sugar or syrup flavoured water). \n\n \n\nWhen switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating \n\ntreatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for \n\n\n\n3 \n\nthe zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper \n\nabsorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least \n\n1 hour. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \n\nZinc acetate dihydrate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of \n\nits slow onset of action. Symptomatic patients must be initially treated with a chelating agent; once \n\ncopper levels are below toxic thresholds and patients are clinically stable, maintenance treatment with \n\nWilzin can be considered. \n\nNevertheless, while awaiting zinc induced duodenal metallothionein production and consequential \n\neffective inhibition of copper absorption, zinc acetate dehydrate could be administered initially in \n\nsymptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent. \n\n \n\nAlthough rare, clinical deterioration may occur at the beginning of the treatment, as has also been \n\nreported with chelating agents. Whether this is related to mobilisation of copper stores or to natural \n\nhistory of the disease remains unclear. A change of therapy is recommended in this situation. \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when switching patients with portal hypertension from a chelating agent \n\nto Wilzin, when such patients are doing well and the treatment is tolerated. Two patients of a series of \n\n16 died from hepatic decompensation and advanced portal hypertension after being changed from \n\npenicillamine to zinc therapy. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic monitoring \n\nThe aim of the treatment is to maintain the plasma free copper (also known as non-ceruloplasmin \n\nplasma copper) below 250 microgram/l (normal: 100-150 microgram/l) and the urinary copper \n\nexcretion below 125 microgram/24 h (normal: < 50 microgram/24 h). The non-ceruloplasmin plasma \n\ncopper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, \n\ngiven that each milligram of ceruloplasmin contains 3 micrograms of copper. \n\nThe urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of body loading with excess copper only \n\nwhen patients are not on chelation therapy. Urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation \n\ntherapy such as penicillamine or trientine. \n\nThe level of hepatic copper cannot be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between \n\npotentially toxic free copper and metallothionein bound copper. \n\nIn treated patients, assays of urinary and/or plasma zinc may be a useful measure of treatment \n\ncompliance. Values of urinary zinc above 2 mg/24 h and of plasma zinc above 1250 microgram/l \n\ngenerally indicate adequate compliance. \n\n \n\nLike with all anti-copper agents overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is \n\nespecially harmful for children and pregnant women since copper is required for proper growth and \n\nmental development. In these patient groups, urinary copper levels should be kept a little above the \n\nupper limit of normal or in the high normal range (i.e. 40 \u2013 50 microgram/24 h). \n\nLaboratory follow-up including haematological surveillance and lipoproteins determination should \n\nalso be performed in order to detect early manifestations of copper deficiency, such as anaemia and/or \n\nleukopenia resulting from bone marrow depression, and decrease in HDL cholesterol and HDL/total \n\ncholesterol ratio. \n\nAs copper deficiency may also cause myeloneuropathy, physicians should be alert to sensory and \n\nmotor symptoms and signs which may potentially indicate incipient neuropathy or myelopathy in \n\npatients treated with Wilzin. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nOther anti-copper agents \n\nPharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Wilson\u2019s disease patients on the combination of Wilzin \n\n(50 mg three times daily) with ascorbic acid (1 g once daily), penicillamine (250 mg four times daily), \n\nand trientine (250 mg four times daily). They showed no significant overall effect on copper balance \n\nalthough mild interaction of zinc with chelators (penicillamine and trientine) could be detected with \n\ndecreased faecal but increased urinary copper excretion as compared with zinc alone. This is probably \n\ndue to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active \n\nsubstances. \n\nWhen switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating \n\ntreatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for \n\nthe zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper \n\nabsorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least \n\n1 hour. \n\n \n\nOther medicinal products \n\nThe absorption of zinc may be reduced by iron and calcium supplements, tetracyclines and \n\nphosphorus-containing compounds, while zinc may reduce the absorption of iron, tetracyclines, \n\nfluoroquinolones. \n\n \n\nFood \n\nStudies of the co-administration of zinc with food performed in healthy volunteers showed that the \n\nabsorption of zinc was significantly delayed by many foods (including bread, hard boiled eggs, coffee \n\nand milk). Substances in food, especially phytates and fibres, bind zinc and prevent it from entering \n\nthe intestinal cells. However, protein appears to interfere the least. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease give no indication \n\nof harmful effects of zinc on embryo/foetus and mother. Five miscarriages and 2 birth defects \n\n(microcephaly and correctable heart defect) were reported in 42 pregnancies. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies conducted with different zinc salts do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \n\nwith respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development \n\n(see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nIt is extremely important that pregnant Wilson\u2019s disease patients continue their therapy during \n\npregnancy. Which treatment should be used, zinc or chelating agent should be decided by the \n\nphysician. Dose adjustments to guarantee that the foetus will not become copper deficient must be \n\ndone and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLactation \nZinc is excreted in human breast milk and zinc-induced copper deficiency in the breast-fed baby may \n\noccur. Therefore, breast-feeding should be avoided during Wilzin therapy. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon \n\n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n \n\nuncommon: sideroblastic anaemia, leukopenia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\ncommon: gastric irritation \n\nInvestigations common: blood amylase, lipase and alkaline \n\nphosphatase increased \n\n \n\n \n\nAnaemia may be micro-, normo- or macrocytic and is often associated with leukopenia. Bone marrow \n\nexamination usually reveals characteristic \"ringed sideroblasts\" (i.e. developing red blood cells \n\ncontaining iron-engorged paranuclear mitochondria). They may be early manifestations of copper \n\ndeficiency and may recover rapidly following reduction of zinc dosage. However, they must be \n\ndistinguished from haemolytic anaemia which commonly occurs where there is elevated serum free \n\ncopper in uncontrolled Wilson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nThe most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation. This is usually worst with the first morning \n\ndose and disappears after the first days of treatment. Delaying the first dose to mid-morning or taking \n\nthe dose with a little protein may usually relieve the symptoms. \n\n \n\nElevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase may occur after a few weeks of \n\ntreatment, with levels usually returning to high normal within the first one or two years of treatment. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThree cases of acute oral overdose with zinc salts (sulphate or gluconate) have been reported in the \n\nliterature. Death occurred in a 35 year-old woman on the fifth day after ingestion of 6 g of zinc \n\n(40 times the proposed therapeutic dose) and was attributed to renal failure and haemorrhagic \n\npancreatitis with hyperglycaemic coma. The same dose did not produce any symptoms except for \n\nvomiting in an adolescent who was treated by whole-bowel irrigation. Another adolescent who \n\ningested 4 g of zinc had serum zinc level of about 50 mg/l 5 hours later and only experienced severe \n\nnausea, vomiting and dizziness. \n\n \n\nTreatment of overdose should be with gastric lavage or induced emesis as quickly as possible to \n\nremove unabsorbed zinc. Heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if plasma zinc levels are \n\nmarkedly elevated (> 10 mg/l). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX05. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic \n\nexcretion of copper in the bile. Copper accumulation in the liver leads to hepatocellular injury and \n\neventual cirrhosis. When the liver capacity of storing copper is exceeded copper is released into the \n\nblood and is taken up in extra hepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders and \n\npsychiatric manifestations. Patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or \n\npsychiatric symptoms. \n\n \n\nThe active moiety in zinc acetate dihydrate is zinc cation, which blocks the intestinal absorption of \n\ncopper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper. Zinc induces the \n\nproduction of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its \n\ntransfer into the blood. The bound copper is then eliminated in the stool following desquamation of the \n\nintestinal cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic investigations of copper metabolism in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease included \n\ndeterminations of net copper balance and radiolabelled copper uptake. A daily regimen of 150 mg of \n\nWilzin in three administrations was shown to be effective in significantly reducing copper absorption \n\nand inducing a negative copper balance. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nSince the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, \n\npharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc \n\nbioavailability at the site of action.  \n\n \n\nZinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at \n\nincreasing doses. Fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake. It ranges from 30 \n\nto 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of \n\n100 mg/d. \n\n \n\nIn the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder \n\nbeing bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. The liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic \n\nzinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc. \n\n \n\nThe plasma elimination half-life of zinc in healthy subjects is around 1 hour after a dose of 45 mg. The \n\nelimination of zinc results primarily from faecal excretion with relatively little from urine and sweat. \n\nThe faecal excretion is in the greatest part due to the passage of unabsorbed zinc but it is also due to \n\nendogenous intestinal secretion. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nPreclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts. Pharmacological \n\nand toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal \n\nspecies. \n\nThe oral LD50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human \n\ntherapeutic dose). Repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the NOEL (No Observed Effect \n\nLevel) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose). \n\nThe weight of evidence, from in vitro and in vivo tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant \n\ngenotoxic activity. \n\nReproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant \n\nevidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity. \n\nNo conventional carcinogenicity study has been conducted with zinc acetate dihydrate. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 50 mg of zinc (corresponding to 167.84 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate). \n\n \n\nExcipients: \n\nEach capsule contains 1.75 mg of sunset yellow FCF (E110) \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nHard capsule. \n\nCapsule with orange opaque cap and body, imprinted \"93-377\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of Wilson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nWilzin treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment \n\nof Wilson\u2019s disease (see section 4.4). Wilzin is a life-long therapy. \n \n\nThere is no difference in dose between symptomatic and presymptomatic patients. \n\nWilzin is available in hard capsules of 25 mg or 50 mg. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Adults: \nThe usual dose is 50 mg 3 times daily with a maximum dose of 50 mg 5 times daily. \n\n\uf0b7 Children and adolescents: \nData are very limited in children under 6 years but since the disease is fully penetrant, \n\nprophylactic treatment should be considered as early as possible. The recommended dosage is \n\nas follows: \n\n- from 1 to 6 years: 25 mg twice daily \n\n- from 6 to 16 years if bodyweight under 57 kg: 25 mg three times daily \n\n- from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 50 mg three times daily. \n\n\uf0b7 Pregnant women: \nA dose of 25 mg 3 times daily is usually effective but the dose should be adjusted to copper \n\nlevels (see section 4.4 and section 4.6). \n\n \n\nIn all cases, dose should be adjusted according to therapeutic monitoring (see section 4.4.). \n\n \n\nWilzin must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. In case of \n\ngastric intolerance, often occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be delayed to mid-morning, \n\nbetween breakfast and lunch. It is also possible to take Wilzin with a little protein, such as meat (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn children who are unable to swallow capsules, these should be opened and their content suspended in \n\na little water (possibly sugar or syrup flavoured water). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nWhen switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating \n\ntreatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for \n\nthe zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper \n\nabsorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least \n\n1 hour. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \n\nZinc acetate dihydrate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of \n\nits slow onset of action. Symptomatic patients must be initially treated with a chelating agent; once \n\ncopper levels are below toxic thresholds and patients are clinically stable, maintenance treatment with \n\nWilzin can be considered. \n\nNevertheless, while awaiting zinc induced duodenal metallothionein production and consequential \n\neffective inhibition of copper absorption, zinc acetate dehydrate could be administered initially in \n\nsymptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent. \n\n \n\nAlthough rare, clinical deterioration may occur at the beginning of the treatment, as has also been \n\nreported with chelating agents. Whether this is related to mobilisation of copper stores or to natural \n\nhistory of the disease remains unclear. A change of therapy is recommended in this situation. \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when switching patients with portal hypertension from a chelating agent \n\nto Wilzin, when such patients are doing well and the treatment is tolerated. Two patients of a series of \n\n16 died from hepatic decompensation and advanced portal hypertension after being changed from \n\npenicillamine to zinc therapy. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic monitoring \n\nThe aim of the treatment is to maintain the plasma free copper (also known as non-ceruloplasmin \n\nplasma copper) below 250 microgram/l (normal: 100-150 microgram/l) and the urinary copper \n\nexcretion below 125 microgram/24 h (normal: < 50 microgram/24 h). The non-ceruloplasmin plasma \n\ncopper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, \n\ngiven that each milligram of ceruloplasmin contains 3 micrograms of copper. \n\nThe urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of body loading with excess copper only \n\nwhen patients are not on chelation therapy. Urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation \n\ntherapy such as penicillamine or trientine. \n\nThe level of hepatic copper cannot be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between \n\npotentially toxic free copper and metallothionein bound copper. \n\nIn treated patients, assays of urinary and/or plasma zinc may be a useful measure of treatment \n\ncompliance. Values of urinary zinc above 2 mg/24 h and of plasma zinc above 1250 microgram/l \n\ngenerally indicate adequate compliance. \n\n \n\nLike with all anti-copper agents overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is \n\nespecially harmful for children and pregnant women since copper is required for proper growth and \n\nmental development. In these patient groups, urinary copper levels should be kept a little above the \n\nupper limit of normal or in the high normal range (i.e. 40 \u2013 50 microgram/24 h). \n\nLaboratory follow-up including haematological surveillance and lipoproteins determination should \n\nalso be performed in order to detect early manifestations of copper deficiency, such as anaemia and/or \n\nleukopenia resulting from bone marrow depression, and decrease in HDL cholesterol and HDL/total \n\ncholesterol ratio. \n\nAs copper deficiency may also cause myeloneuropathy, physicians should be alert to sensory and \n\nmotor symptoms and signs which may potentially indicate incipient neuropathy or myelopathy in \n\npatients treated with Wilzin. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe capsule shell contains sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nOther anti-copper agents \n\nPharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Wilson\u2019s disease patients on the combination of Wilzin \n\n(50 mg three times daily) with ascorbic acid (1 g once daily), penicillamine (250 mg four times daily), \n\nand trientine (250 mg four times daily). They showed no significant overall effect on copper balance \n\nalthough mild interaction of zinc with chelators (penicillamine and trientine) could be detected with \n\ndecreased faecal but increased urinary copper excretion as compared with zinc alone. This is probably \n\ndue to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active \n\nsubstances. \n\nWhen switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating \n\ntreatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for \n\nthe zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper \n\nabsorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least \n\n1 hour. \n\n \n\nOther medicinal products \n\nThe absorption of zinc may be reduced by iron and calcium supplements, tetracyclines and \n\nphosphorus-containing compounds, while zinc may reduce the absorption of iron, tetracyclines, \n\nfluoroquinolones. \n\n \n\nFood \n\nStudies of the co-administration of zinc with food performed in healthy volunteers showed that the \n\nabsorption of zinc was significantly delayed by many foods (including bread, hard boiled eggs, coffee \n\nand milk). Substances in food, especially phytates and fibres, bind zinc and prevent it from entering \n\nthe intestinal cells. However, protein appears to interfere the least. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease give no indication \n\nof harmful effects of zinc on embryo/foetus and mother. Five miscarriages and 2 birth defects \n\n(microcephaly and correctable heart defect) were reported in 42 pregnancies. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies conducted with different zinc salts do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \n\nwith respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development \n\n(see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nIt is extremely important that pregnant Wilson\u2019s disease patients continue their therapy during \n\npregnancy. Which treatment should be used, zinc or chelating agent should be decided by the \n\nphysician. Dose adjustments to guarantee that the foetus will not become copper deficient must be \n\ndone and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLactation \n\nZinc is excreted in human breast milk and zinc-induced copper deficiency in the breast-fed baby may \n\noccur. Therefore, breast-feeding should be avoided during Wilzin therapy. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon \n\n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n \n\nuncommon: sideroblastic anaemia, leukopenia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\ncommon: gastric irritation \n\nInvestigations common: blood amylase, lipase and alkaline \n\nphosphatase increased \n\n \n\n \n\nAnaemia may be micro-, normo- or macrocytic and is often associated with leukopenia. Bone marrow \n\nexamination usually reveals characteristic \"ringed sideroblasts\" (i.e. developing red blood cells \n\ncontaining iron-engorged paranuclear mitochondria). They may be early manifestations of copper \n\ndeficiency and may recover rapidly following reduction of zinc dosage. However, they must be \n\ndistinguished from haemolytic anaemia which commonly occurs where there is elevated serum free \n\ncopper in uncontrolled Wilson\u2019s disease. \n \n\nThe most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation. This is usually worst with the first morning \n\ndose and disappears after the first days of treatment. Delaying the first dose to mid-morning or taking \n\nthe dose with a little protein may usually relieve the symptoms. \n\n \n\nElevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase may occur after a few weeks of \n\ntreatment, with levels usually returning to high normal within the first one or two years of treatment. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThree cases of acute oral overdose with zinc salts (sulphate or gluconate) have been reported in the \n\nliterature. Death occurred in a 35 year-old woman on the fifth day after ingestion of 6 g of zinc \n\n(40 times the proposed therapeutic dose) and was attributed to renal failure and haemorrhagic \n\npancreatitis with hyperglycaemic coma. The same dose did not produce any symptoms except for \n\nvomiting in an adolescent who was treated by whole-bowel irrigation. Another adolescent who \n\ningested 4 g of zinc had serum zinc level of about 50 mg/l 5 hours later and only experienced severe \n\nnausea, vomiting and dizziness. \n\n \n\nTreatment of overdose should be with gastric lavage or induced emesis as quickly as possible to \n\nremove unabsorbed zinc. Heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if plasma zinc levels are \n\nmarkedly elevated (> 10 mg/l). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX05. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nWilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic \n\nexcretion of copper in the bile. Copper accumulation in the liver leads to hepatocellular injury and \n\neventual cirrhosis. When the liver capacity of storing copper is exceeded copper is released into the \n\nblood and is taken up in extra hepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders and \n\npsychiatric manifestations. Patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or \n\npsychiatric symptoms. \n\n \n\nThe active moiety in zinc acetate dihydrate is zinc cation, which blocks the intestinal absorption of \n\ncopper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper. Zinc induces the \n\nproduction of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its \n\ntransfer into the blood. The bound copper is then eliminated in the stool following desquamation of the \n\nintestinal cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic investigations of copper metabolism in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease included \n\ndeterminations of net copper balance and radiolabelled copper uptake. A daily regimen of 150 mg of \n\nWilzin in three administrations was shown to be effective in significantly reducing copper absorption \n\nand inducing a negative copper balance. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nSince the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, \n\npharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc \n\nbioavailability at the site of action.  \n\n \n\nZinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at \n\nincreasing doses. Fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake. It ranges from 30 \n\nto 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of \n\n100 mg/d. \n\n \n\nIn the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder \n\nbeing bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. The liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic \n\nzinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc. \n\n \n\nThe plasma elimination half-life of zinc in healthy subjects is around 1 hour after a dose of 45 mg. The \n\nelimination of zinc results primarily from faecal excretion with relatively little from urine and sweat. \n\nThe faecal excretion is in the greatest part due to the passage of unabsorbed zinc but it is also due to \n\nendogenous intestinal secretion. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nPreclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts. Pharmacological \n\nand toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal \n\nspecies. \n\nThe oral LD50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human \n\ntherapeutic dose). Repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the NOEL (No Observed Effect \n\nLevel) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose). \n\nThe weight of evidence, from in vitro and in vivo tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant \n\ngenotoxic activity. \n\nReproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant \n\nevidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity. \n\nNo conventional carcinogenicity study has been conducted with zinc acetate dihydrate. \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you personally. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. \n\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Wilzin is and what it is used for \n\n2. Before you take Wilzin \n\n3. How to take Wilzin \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5 How to store Wilzin \n\n6. Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT WILZIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \n\nWilzin belongs to a group of medicines called Various Alimentary Tract and metabolism products.  \n\n \n\nWilzin is indicated in the treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease, which is a rare inherited defect in copper \n\nexcretion. Dietary copper, which cannot be properly eliminated, accumulates first in the liver, then in \n\nother organs such as the eyes and the brain. This potentially leads to liver damage and neurological \n\ndisorders. \n\nWilzin blocks the absorption of copper from the intestine thereby preventing its transfer into the blood \n\nand its further accumulation in the body. Unabsorbed copper is then eliminated in the stool. \n\n \n\nWilson\u2019s disease will persist during the entire lifetime of the patient and therefore the need for this \n\ntreatment is life-long. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE WILZIN \n\n \n\nDo not take Wilzin \nIf you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zinc or any of the other ingredients of Wilzin. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Wilzin \n\nWilzin is usually not recommended for initial therapy of patients with signs and symptoms of \n\nWilson\u2019s disease because of its slow onset of action. \n\n \n\nIf you are currently treated with another anti-copper agent, for example, penicillamine, your doctor \n\nmay add Wilzin before stopping the initial treatment. \n\n \n\nAs with other anti-copper agents such as penicillamine, your symptoms may get worse after starting \n\nthe treatment. In this case, you must inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nIn order to follow up your condition and treatment your doctor will check your blood and urine on a \n\nregular basis. This is to ensure that you receive sufficient treatment. Monitoring may detect evidence \n\n\n\n25 \n\nof insufficient treatment (copper excess) or excessive treatment (copper deficiency), both of which can \n\nbe harmful, particularly to growing children and pregnant women. \n\nYou should tell your doctor if you experience unusual muscle weakness or abnormal feeling in your \n\nlimbs as this may indicate excessive treatment. \n \n\nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or your pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\nPlease consult your doctor before taking any other medicines which may reduce the effectiveness of \n\nWilzin, such as iron, calcium supplements, tetracyclines (antibiotics) or phosphorus. Conversely, the \n\neffectiveness of some medicines, such as iron, tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones (antibiotics), may be \n\nreduced by Wilzin. \n\n \n\nTaking Wilzin with food and drink \n\nWilzin should be taken on an empty stomach, separated from mealtimes. Dietary fibres and some dairy \n\nproducts, in particular, delay the absorption of zinc salts. Some patients experience stomach upset after \n\nthe morning dose. Please discuss the matter with your Wilson\u2019s disease doctor if this affects you. \n\nThis side effect may be reduced by postponing the first dose of the day until mid-morning (between \n\nbreakfast and the midday meal). It may also be minimised by taking the first dose of Wilzin with a \n\nsmall amount of protein-containing food, such as meat (but not milk). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nPlease consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. It is very important to continue anti-copper \n\ntherapy during pregnancy. \n\nIf you become pregnant during therapy with Wilzin, your doctor will decide which treatment and \n\nwhich dose is best in your situation.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nBreast-feeding should be avoided if you are on Wilzin therapy. Please discuss with your doctor. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Wilzin \n\nWilzin 50 mg hard capsules contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW TO TAKE WILZIN \n\n \n\nAlways take Wilzin exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. For the different dose regimens Wilzin is available in hard capsules of \n\n25 mg or 50 mg. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 For adults: \nThe usual dose is 1 hard capsule of Wilzin 50 mg (or 2 hard capsules of Wilzin 25 mg) three times \n\ndaily with a maximum dose of 1 hard capsule of Wilzin 50 mg (or 2 hard capsules of \n\nWilzin 25 mg) five times daily. \n\n\uf0b7 For children and adolescents: \nThe usual dose is: \n\n - from 1 to 6 years: 1 hard capsule of Wilzin 25 mg twice daily \n\n - from 6 to 16 years if bodyweight under 57 kg: 1 hard capsule of Wilzin 25 mg three times \n\ndaily \n\n - from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 2 hard capsules of Wilzin 25 mg or 1 hard \n\ncapsule of Wilzin 50 mg three times daily. \n\n \n\nAlways take Wilzin on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf the morning dose is not well tolerated (see section 4) it is possible to delay it to mid-morning, \n\nbetween breakfast and lunch. It is also possible to take Wilzin with a little protein, such as meat. \n\n \n\nIf you have been prescribed Wilzin with another anti-copper agent, such as penicillamine, keep an \n\ninterval of at least 1 hour between the two medicines. \n\n \n\nTo administer Wilzin to children who are unable to swallow capsules, open the capsule and mix the \n\npowder with a little water (possibly flavoured with sugar or syrup). \n \n\nIf you take more Wilzin than you should: \nIf you take more Wilzin than prescribed, you may experience nausea, vomiting and dizziness. In this \n\ncase you must ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Wilzin: \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \n\nLike all medicines, Wilzin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them..  \n\n \n\nThese side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows:  \n\n\uf0b7 very common: affects more than 1 user in 10 \n\n\uf0b7 common:  affects 1 to 10 users in 100 \n\n\uf0b7 uncommon:  affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000 \n\n\uf0b7 rare:   affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000 \n\n\uf0b7 very rare:  affects less than 1 user in 10,000 \n\n\uf0b7 not known:  frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. \n \n\nCommon:  \n\n\uf0b7 After Wilzin intake, gastric irritation may occur, especially at the beginning of treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 Changes in blood tests have been reported, including an increase in some liver and pancreatic \nenzymes. \n\n \n\nUncommon:  \n\n\uf0b7 A decrease in blood red and white cells may occur. \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. HOW TO STORE WILZIN \n \n\n\uf0b7 Keep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Do not use Wilzin after the expiry date stated on the bottle and the carton, after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Do not store above 25\u00b0C. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

products. wilzin is indicated in the treatment of wilson's disease, which is a rare inherited defect in copper excretion. dietary copper, which cannot be properly eliminated, accumulates first in the liver, then in other organs such as the eyes and the brain. this potentially leads to liver damage and neurological disorders. wilzin blocks the absorption of copper from the intestine thereby preventing its transfer into the blood and its further accumulation in the body. unabsorbed copper is then eliminated in the stool. wilson's disease will persist during the entire lifetime of the patient and therefore the need for this treatment is life-long.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "wilzin", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "medicines", "Type":

"Section_2": {"Title": "2. before you take wilzin", "Section_Content": "do not take wilzin if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zinc or any of the other ingredients of wilzin. take special care with wilzin wilzin is usually not recommended for initial therapy of patients with signs and symptoms of wilson's disease because of its slow onset of action. if you are currently treated with another anti-copper agent, for example, penicillamine, your doctor may add wilzin before stopping the initial treatment. as with other anti-copper agents such as penicillamine, your symptoms may get worse after starting the treatment. in this case, you must inform your doctor. in order to follow up your condition and treatment your doctor will check your blood and urine on a regular basis. this is to ensure that you receive sufficient treatment. monitoring may detect evidence 25 of insufficient treatment (copper excess) or excessive treatment (copper deficiency), both of which can be harmful, particularly to growing children and pregnant women. you should tell your doctor if you experience unusual muscle weakness or abnormal feeling in your limbs as this may indicate excessive treatment. taking other medicines please tell your doctor or your pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. please consult your doctor before taking any other medicines which may reduce the effectiveness of wilzin, such as iron, calcium supplements, tetracyclines (antibiotics) or phosphorus. conversely, the effectiveness of some medicines, such as iron, tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones (antibiotics), may be reduced by wilzin. taking wilzin with food and drink wilzin should be taken on an empty stomach, separated from mealtimes. dietary fibres and some dairy products, in particular, delay the absorption of zinc salts. some patients experience stomach upset after the morning dose. please discuss the matter with your wilson's disease doctor if this affects you. this side effect may be reduced by postponing the first dose of the day until mid-morning (between breakfast and the midday meal). it may also be minimised by taking the first dose of wilzin with a small amount of protein-containing food, such as meat (but not milk). pregnancy please consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. it is very important to continue anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. if you become pregnant during therapy with wilzin, your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. breast-feeding breast-feeding should be avoided if you are on wilzin therapy. please discuss with your doctor. driving and using machines no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. important information about some of the ingredients of wilzin wilzin 50 mg hard capsules contains sunset yellow fcf (e110) which may cause allergic reactions.",

of wilzin 25 mg three times daily - from 16 years or if bodyweight above 57 kg: 2 hard capsules of wilzin 25 mg or 1 hard capsule of wilzin 50 mg three times daily. always take wilzin on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or 2-3 hours after meals. if the morning dose is not well tolerated (see section 4) it is possible to delay it to mid-morning, between breakfast and lunch. it is also possible to take wilzin with a little protein, such as meat. if you have been prescribed wilzin with another anti-copper agent, such as penicillamine, keep an interval of at least 1 hour between the two medicines. to administer wilzin to children who are unable to swallow capsules, open the capsule and mix the powder with a little water (possibly flavoured with sugar or syrup). if you take more wilzin than you should: if you take more wilzin than prescribed, you may experience nausea, vomiting and dizziness. in this case you must ask your doctor for advice. if you forget to take wilzin: do
