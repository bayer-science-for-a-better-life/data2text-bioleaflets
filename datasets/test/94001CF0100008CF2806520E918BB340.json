QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 84.4 mg of eliglustat (as tartrate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach capsule contains 106 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule \n \nCapsule with pearl blue-green opaque cap and pearl white opaque body with \u201cGZ02\u201d printed in black \non the body of the capsule. The size of the capsule is \u2018size 2\u2019 (dimensions 18.0 x 6.4 mm). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), \nwho are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers \n(EMs). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTherapy with Cerdelga should be initiated and supervised by a physician knowledgeable in the \nmanagement of Gaucher disease. \n \nPosology   \n \nThe recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) \nand extensive metabolisers (EMs). The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat once daily in CYP2D6 \npoor metabolisers (PMs).  \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the prescribed dose should be taken at the next scheduled time; the next dose \nshould not be doubled. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nCYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (URMs) and indeterminate metabolisers \nEliglustat should not be used in patients who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (URMs) or \nindeterminate metabolisers (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, \neliglustat is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), \neliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no \ndosage adjustment is required and the recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily.  \n \nIn CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs) with any degree of hepatic \nimpairment, eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment taking a strong \nor moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, Cerdelga is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  \n \nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment taking a weak CYP2D6 \ninhibitor or a strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of 84 mg eliglustat once daily should \nbe considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, no dosage \nadjustment is required and the recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nIn CYP2D6 EMs with end stage renal disease (ESRD), eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2).     \n \nIn CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs) with mild, moderate or \nsevere renal impairment or ESRD, eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nElderly  \nThere is limited experience in the treatment of elderly with eliglustat. Data indicates that no dosage \nadjustment is considered necessary (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n  \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Cerdelga in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nCerdelga is to be taken orally. The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, and \nshould not be crushed, dissolved, or opened.  \n \nThe capsules may be taken with or without food. Consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPatients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers (EMs) taking a \nstrong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, and \npatients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Use of Cerdelga \nunder these conditions results in substantially elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations (see \nsection 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nDue to significantly increased eliglustat plasma concentrations, Cerdelga is contraindicated in \nCYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe hepatic impairment and in CYP2D6 extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 \ninhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInitiation of therapy: CYP2D6 genotyping \n \nBefore initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 to determine \nthe CYP2D6 metaboliser status (see section 4.2, Special populations). \n \nDrug-drug interactions \n \nCerdelga is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs) taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong  or \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitor, and in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.3).  \n \nFor use of eliglustat with one strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 or CYP3A, see section 4.5. \n \nUse of eliglustat with strong CYP3A inducers substantially decreases the exposure to eliglustat, which \nmay reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of eliglustat; therefore concomitant administration is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with pre-existing cardiac conditions \n \nUse of eliglustat in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions has not been studied during clinical \ntrials. Because eliglustat is predicted to cause mild increases in ECG intervals at substantially elevated \nplasma concentrations, use of eliglustat should be avoided in patients with cardiac disease (congestive \nheart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia), \nlong QT syndrome, and in combination with Class IA (e.g. quinidine) and Class III (e.g. amiodarone, \nsotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nLimited data are available in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. Use of eliglustat in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.2. and 5.2). \n\nLimited or no data are available in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers \n(PMs) with any degree of hepatic impairment. Use of eliglustat in these patients is not recommended \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nConcomitant use of eliglustat with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers \n(EMs) with mild hepatic impairment can result in further elevation of eliglustat plasma concentrations, \nwith the magnitude of the effect depending on the enzyme inhibited and the potency of the inhibitor. \nIn CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment taking a weak CYP2D6 \ninhibitor or strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of  84 mg eliglustat mg once daily \nshould be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n   \nLimited or no data are available in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs), intermediate metabolisers \n(IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs)  with ESRD and in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or \npoor metabolisers (PMs) with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment; use of eliglustat in these \npatients is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMonitoring of clinical response \n \nSome treatment-na\u00efve patients showed less than 20% spleen volume reduction (sub-optimal results) \nafter 9 months of treatment (see section 5.1). For these patients, monitoring for further improvement or \nan alternative treatment modality should be considered. \n \nFor patients with stable disease who switch from enzyme replacement therapy to eliglustat, monitoring \nfor disease progression (e.g. after 6 months with regular monitoring thereafter) should be performed \nfor all disease domains to evaluate disease stability. Reinstitution of enzyme replacement therapy or an \nalternative treatment modality should be considered in individual patients who have a sub-optimal \nresponse. \n \nLactose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEliglustat is metabolised primarily by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Concomitant \nadministration of substances affecting CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity may alter eliglustat plasma \nconcentrations. Eliglustat is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP2D6 in vitro; concomitant administration of \neliglustat with P-gp or CYP2D6 substrate substances may increase the plasma concentration of those \nsubstances. \n \nThe list of substances in section 4.5 is not an inclusive list and the prescriber is advised to consult the \nSmPC of all other prescribed medicinal products for potential drug-drug interactions with eliglustat. \n \nAgents that may increase eliglustat exposure \n \nCerdelga is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs) taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitor , and in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.3). Use of Cerdelga under these conditions results in substantially \nelevated eliglustat plasma concentrations.  \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): \n \nAfter repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration with \nrepeated 30 mg once daily doses of paroxetine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in a 7.3- and \n8.9-fold increase in eliglustat Cmax and AUC0-12, respectively. A dose of eliglustat 84 mg once daily \nshould be considered when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, \nbupropion) is used concomitantly in IMs and EMs. \n \nAt 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of \nmoderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. duloxetine, terbinafine, moclobemide, mirabegron, cinacalcet, \ndronedarone) would increase eliglustat exposure approximately up to 4-fold. Caution should be used \nwith moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors in IMs and EMs. \n \nIn extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2, 4.3 and \n4.4.  \nIn extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.3. \nCYP3A inhibitors \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): \n \nAfter repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration with \nrepeated 400 mg once daily doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, resulted in a 3.8 and \n4.3-fold increase in eliglustat Cmax and AUC0-12, respectively; similar effects would be expected for \nother strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, cobicistat, \nindinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, posaconazole, voriconazole, \ntelithromycin, conivaptan, boceprevir). Caution should be used with strong CYP3A inhibitors in IMs \nand EMs. \n \nAt 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, \naprepitant, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib, cimetidine) would increase eliglustat \nexposure approximately up to 3-fold. Caution should be used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors in IMs \nand EMs. \n \nIn extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.4.  \n \nIn extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.3. \n \nIn poor metabolisers (PMs): \n \nAt 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat in PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of strong \nCYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, cobicistat, indinavir, lopinavir, \nritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, \nboceprevir) would increase the Cmax and AUC0-24 of eliglustat 4.3- and 6.2-fold. The use of strong \nCYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated in PMs. \n \nAt 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat in PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of moderate \nCYP3A inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, aprepitant, \natazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib, cimetidine) would increase the Cmax and AUC0-24 of \neliglustat 2.4- and 3.0-fold, respectively. Use of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with eliglustat is not \nrecommended in PMs. \n \nCaution should be used with weak CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. amlodipine, cilostazol, fluvoxamine, \ngoldenseal, isoniazid, ranitidine, ranolazine) in PMs. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors used simultaneously with CYP3A inhibitors \nIn intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): \n \nAt 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that the concomitant use of \nstrong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors would increase Cmax \nand AUC0-12 up to 17- and 25-fold, respectively. The use of a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor \nconcomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is contraindicated in IMs and EMs. \n \nGrapefruit products contain one or more components that inhibit CYP3A and can increase plasma \nconcentrations of eliglustat. Consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be avoided. \n \nAgents that may decrease eliglustat exposure \n \nStrong CYP3A inducers \nAfter repeated 127 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration of \nrepeated 600 mg once daily doses of rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A as well as the efflux \ntransporter P-gp) resulted in an approximately 85% decrease in eliglustat exposure. After repeated \n84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in PMs, concomitant administration of repeated 600 mg once \ndaily doses of rifampicin resulted in an approximately 95% decrease in eliglustat exposure. Use of a \n\n\n\n7 \n\nstrong CYP3A inducer (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin and St. \nJohn\u2019s wort) with eliglustat is not recommended in IMs, EMs and PMs. \n \nAgents whose exposure may be increased by eliglustat \n \nP-gp substrates \nAfter a single 0.25 mg dose of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, concomitant administration of 127 mg twice \ndaily doses of eliglustat resulted in a 1.7- and 1.5-fold increase in digoxin Cmax and AUClast, \nrespectively. Lower doses of substances which are P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, colchicine, \ndabigatran, phenytoin, pravastatin) may be required. \n \nCYP2D6 substrates \nAfter a single 50 mg dose of metoprolol, a CYP2D6 substrate, concomitant administration of repeated \n127 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat resulted in a 1.5- and 2.1-fold increase in metoprolol Cmax and \nAUC, respectively. Lower doses of medicinal products that are CYP2D6 substrates may be required. \nThese include certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, \nimipramine, and desipramine), phenothiazines, dextromethorphan and atomoxetine). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of eliglustat in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is recommended to avoid the use of Cerdelga during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether eliglustat or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of eliglustat in milk (see section \n5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Cerdelga therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nEffects on testes and reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis were observed in rats (see section 5.3). \nThe relevance of these findings for humans is not known. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCerdelga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall adverse reaction profile of Cerdelga is based on 1400 patient-years of treatment exposure \nand pooled results from the primary analysis periods and extension periods of two pivotal Phase 3 \nstudies (ENGAGE and ENCORE), one 8-year, long term Phase 2 study (Study 304) and one \nsupporting Phase 3b study (EDGE). In these four studies a total of 393 patients between the ages of \n16-75 years received eliglustat for a median duration of 3.5 years (up to 9.3 years). \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction with Cerdelga is dyspepsia, in approximately 6% of the \nclinical trial patients.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked by system organ class and frequency ([very common (\u22651/10); common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000)]). Adverse reactions from long term clinical trial data reported in at least 4 patients are \npresented in Table 1.Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class Common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache*, dizziness*, dysgeusia \nCardiac disorders Palpitations \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Throat irritation \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDyspepsia, abdominal pain upper*, \ndiarrhoea*, nausea, constipation, abdominal \npain*, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, \nabdominal distension*, gastritis, dysphagia, \nvomiting*, dry mouth, flatulence  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Dry skin, urticaria*  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia, pain in extremity*, back pain*  \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue \n\n \n* The incidence of the adverse reaction was the same or higher with placebo than with Cerdelga in the \n\nplacebo-controlled pivotal study. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest eliglustat plasma concentration observed to date occurred in a Phase 1 single-dose dose \nescalation study in healthy subjects, in a subject taking a dose equivalent to approximately 21 times \nthe recommended dose for GD1 patients. At the time of the highest plasma concentration (59-fold \nhigher than normal therapeutic conditions), the subject experienced dizziness marked by \ndisequilibrium, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. \n  \nIn the event of acute overdose, the patient should be carefully observed and given symptomatic \ntreatment and supportive care. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX10. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nEliglustat is a potent and specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, and acts as a substrate \nreduction therapy (SRT) for GD1. SRT aims to reduce the rate of synthesis of the major substrate \nglucosylceramide (GL-1) to match its impaired rate of catabolism in patients with GD1, thereby \npreventing glucosylceramide accumulation and alleviating clinical manifestations. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn clinical trials in treatment-na\u00efve GD1 patients, plasma GL-1 levels were elevated in the majority of \nthese patients and decreased upon Cerdelga treatment. Additionally, in a clinical trial in GD1 patients \nstabilised on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (i.e. having already achieved therapeutic goals on \nERT prior to initiating Cerdelga treatment), plasma GL-1 levels were normal in most patients and \ndecreased upon Cerdelga treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe recommended dosing regimens (see section 4.2) are based on modelling, either of PK/PD data \nfrom the dose-titration regimens applied in the clinical studies for IMs and EMs, or physiologically-\nbased PK data for PMs. \n \nPivotal study of Cerdelga in treatment-na\u00efve GD1 patients \u2013 study 02507(ENGAGE) \nStudy 02507 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study in \n40 patients with GD1. In the Cerdelga group 3 (15%) patients received a starting dose of 42 mg \neliglustat twice daily during the 9-month primary analysis period and 17 (85%) patients received a \ndose escalation to 84 mg twice daily based on plasma trough concentration. \n \nTable 2: Change from baseline to Month 9 (primary analysis period) in treatment-na\u00efve patients \n\nwith GD1 receiving treatment with Cerdelga in study 02507  \n\n \nPlacebo* \n(n=20) a \n\nCerdelga \n(n=20) a \n\nDifference \n(Cerdelga \u2013 \nPlacebo) \n[95% CI] \n\np valueb \n\nPercentage Change in Spleen Volume MN (%) \n(primary endpoint) 2.26 -27.77 \n\n-30.0 \n[-36.8, -23.2] <0.0001 \n\nAbsolute Change in Haemoglobin Level (g/dL) \n(secondary endpoint) -0.54\n\n  0.69 1.22 [0.57, 1.88] 0.0006 \n\nPercentage Change in Liver Volume MN (%) \n(secondary endpoint) 1.44\n\n  -5.20 -6.64 [-11.37, -1.91] 0.0072 \n\nPercentage Change in Platelet Count (%) \n(secondary endpoint) -9.06\n\n  32.00 41.06 [23.95, 58.17] <0.0001 \n\nMN = Multiples of Normal, CI = confidence interval \na At baseline, mean spleen volumes were 12.5 and 13.9 MN in the placebo and Cerdelga groups, \n\nrespectively, and mean liver volumes were 1.4 MN for both groups.

Results (change from baseline) after 18 months, 30 months and 4.5 years of exposure \nto Cerdelga on the following endpoints were: absolute change in haemoglobin level (g/dL) 1.1 (1.03) \n[n=39], 1.4 (0.93) [n=35], and 1.4 (1.31) [n=12]; mean increase in platelet count (mm3) 58. 5% \n(40.57%) [n=39], 74.6% (49.57%) [n=35], and 86.8% (54.20%) [n=12]; mean reduction in spleen \nvolume (MN) 46.5% (9.75%) [n=38], 54.2% (9.51%) [n=32], and 65.6% (7.43%) [n=13]; and mean \n\n\n\n10 \n\nreduction in liver volume (MN) 13.7% (10.65%) [n=38], 18.5% (11.22%) [n=32], and 23.4% \n(10.59%) [n=13].  \n \nLong-term clinical outcomes in treatment-na\u00efve GD1 patients \u2013 study 304 \nStudy 304 was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Cerdelga in 26 patients. Nineteen \npatients completed 4 years of treatment. Fifteen (79%) of these patients received a dose escalation to \n84 mg eliglustat twice daily; 4 (21%) patients continued to receive 42 mg twice daily.   \n\nEighteen patients completed 8 years of treatment. One patient (6%) received a further dose escalation \nto 127 mg twice daily. Fourteen (78%) continued on 84 mg Cerdelga twice daily. Three (17%) patients \ncontinued to receive 42 mg twice daily. Sixteen patients had an efficacy endpoint assessment at year 8. \n\nCerdelga showed sustained improvements in organ volume and haematological parameters over the 8 \nyear treatment period (see Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Change from baseline to year 8 in study 304  \n\n N Baseline Value \n(Mean) \n\nChange from \nBaseline (Mean) \n \n\nStandard Deviation \n\nSpleen Volume (MN) 15 17.34 -67.9%  17.11 \nHaemoglobin Level (g/dL) 16 11.33 2.08 1.75 \nLiver Volume (MN) 15 1.60 -31.0%  13.51 \nPlatelet Count (x109/L) 16 67.53  109.8%  114.73 \n\nMN = Multiples of Normal \n \nPivotal study of Cerdelga in GD1 patients switching from ERT\u2013 Study 02607 (ENCORE) \nStudy 02607 was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority, multicenter clinical \nstudy in 159 patients previously stabilised with ERT. In the Cerdelga group 34 (32%) patients received \na dose escalation to 84 mg eliglustat twice daily and 51 (48%) to 127 mg twice daily during the 12-\nmonth primary analysis period , and 21 (20%) patients continued to receive 42 mg twice daily. \n \nBased on the aggregate data from all doses tested in this study, Cerdelga met the criteria set in this \nstudy to be declared non-inferior to Cerezyme (imiglucerase) in maintaining patient stability. After 12 \nmonths of treatment, the percentage of patients meeting the primary composite endpoint (composed of \nall four components mentioned in Table 4) was 84.8% [95% confidence interval 76.2% - 91.3%] for \nthe Cerdelga group compared to 93.6% [95% confidence interval 82.5% - 98.7 %] for the Cerezyme \ngroup. Of the patients who did not meet stability criteria for the individual components, 12 of 15 \nCerdelga patients and 3 of 3 Cerezyme patients remained within therapeutic goals for GD1. \n  \nThere were no clinically meaningful differences between groups for any of the four individual disease \nparameters (see Table 4). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 4: Changes from baseline to Month 12 (primary analysis period) in patients with GD1 \nswitching to Cerdelga in study 02607 \n\n \n\nCerezyme \n(N=47)** \nMean [95% CI] \n\nCerdelga \n(N=99) \nMean [95% CI] \n\nSpleen Volume \n Percentage of Patients with stable \nspleen volume*a  100%  95.8% \n\n Percentage Change in Spleen Volume \nMN (%)* -3.01 [-6.41, 0.40] -6.17 [-9.54, -2.79] \n\nHaemoglobin Level \nPercentage of Patients with stable \nhaemoglobin levela 100%  94.9% \n\nAbsolute Change in Haemoglobin \nLevel (g/dL) 0.038 [-0.16, 0.23] -0.21 [-0.35, -0.07] \n\nLiver Volume \nPercentage of Patients with stable liver \nvolumea 93.6%  96.0% \n\nPercentage Change in Liver Volume \nMN (%) 3.57 [0.57, 6.58] 1.78 [-0.15, 3.71] \n\nPlatelet Count \nPercentage of Patients with stable \nplatelet counta 100%  92.9% \n\nPercentage Change in Platelet Count \n(%) 2.93 [-0.56, 6.42] 3.79 [0.01, 7.57] \n\n \nMN = Multiples of Normal, CI = confidence interval \n* Excludes patients with a total splenectomy. \n** All patients transitioned to Cerdelga treatment after 52 weeks  \na The stability criteria based on changes between baseline and 12 months: haemoglobin level \u22641.5 g/dL decrease, platelet \ncount \u226425% decrease, liver volume \u226420% increase, and spleen volume \u226425% increase. \nAll patient number (N)= Per Protocol Population \n\n \nDuring the open-label long term treatment period with Cerdelga (extension phase) the percentage of \npatients with complete data meeting the composite stability endpoint was maintained at 84.6% \n(n=136) after 2 years, 84.4% (n=109) after 3 years and 91.1% (n=45) after 4 years.

The majority of URMs (80%) received a dose escalation to 127 mg eliglustat twice daily, all \nof which had adequate clinical responses. The one URM who received 84 mg twice daily did not have \nan adequate response. \n \nThe predicted exposures with 84 mg eliglustat once daily in patients who are PMs are expected to be \nsimilar to exposures observed with 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers \n(IMs). Patients who are URMs may not achieve adequate concentrations to achieve a therapeutic \neffect. No dosing recommendation for URMs can be given. \n \nEffects on skeletal pathology \n \nAfter 9 months of treatment, in Study 02507, bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, as determined \nby the total Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) score (assessed by MRI in lumbar spine and femur) \ndecreased by a mean of 1.1 points in Cerdelga treated patients (n=19) compared to no change in \npatients receiving placebo (n=20). Five Cerdelga-treated patients (26%) achieved a reduction of at \nleast 2 points in the BMB score.  \n \nAfter 18 and 30 months of treatment, BMB score had decreased by a mean 2.2 points (n=18) and 2.7 \n(n=15), respectively for the patients originally randomised to Cerdelga, compared to a mean decrease \nof 1 point (n=20) and 0.8 (n=16) in those originally randomised to placebo.  \n \nAfter 18 months of Cerdelga treatment in the open-label extension phase, the mean (SD) lumbar spine \nBone Mineral Density T-score increased from -1.14 (1.0118) at Baseline (n=34) to -0.918 \n(1.1601) (n=33) in the normal range. After 30 months and 4.5 years of treatment, the T-score further \nincreased to -0.722 (1.1250) (n=27) and -0.533 (0.8031) (n=9), respectively.  \n \nResults of study 304 indicate that skeletal improvements are maintained or continue to improve during \nat least 8 years of treatment with Cerdelga. \n \nIn study 02607, lumbar spine and femur BMD T- and Z-scores were maintained within the normal \nrange in patients treated with Cerdelga for up to 4 years. \n \nElectrocardiographic evaluation \n \nNo clinically significant QTc prolonging effect of eliglustat was observed for single doses up to \n675 mg. \nHeart-rate corrected QT interval using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) was evaluated in a randomized, \nplacebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, single-dose study in 47 healthy \nsubjects. In this trial with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-\nsided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTcF was below \n10 msec, the threshold for regulatory concern. While there was no apparent effect on heart rate, \nconcentration-related increases were observed for the placebo corrected change from baseline in the \nPR, QRS, and QTc intervals. Based on PK/PD modelling, eliglustat plasma concentrations 11-fold the \npredicted human Cmax are expected to cause mean (upper bound of the 95% confidence interval) \nincreases in the PR, QRS, and QTcF intervals of 18.8 (20.4), 6.2 (7.1), and 12.3 (14.2) msec, \nrespectively. \n \nElderly \n \nA limited number of patients aged 65 years (n=10) and over were enrolled in clinical trials. No \nsignificant differences were found in the efficacy and safety profiles of elderly patients and younger \npatients. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCerdelga in all subsets of the paediatric population in Gaucher disease Type 2 (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCerdelga in the subsets of the paediatric population from 24 months to less than 18 years in Gaucher \ndisease Type 1 and Type 3 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nMedian time to reach maximum plasma concentrations occurs between 1.5 to 6 hours after dosing, \nwith low oral bioavailability (<5%) due to significant first-pass metabolism. Eliglustat is a substrate of \nthe efflux transporter P-gp. Food does not have a clinically relevant effect on eliglustat \npharmacokinetics. Following repeated dosing of eliglustat 84 mg twice daily in non-PMs and once \ndaily in PMs, steady state was reached by 4 days, with an accumulation ratio of 3-fold or less.   \n \nDistribution \n \nEliglustat is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (76 to 83%) and is mainly distributed in \nplasma.  After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution was 816 L, suggesting wide \ndistribution to tissues in humans. Nonclinical studies demonstrated a wide distribution of eliglustat to \ntissues, including bone marrow. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nEliglustat is extensively metabolized with high clearance, mainly by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent \nCYP3A4. Primary metabolic pathways of eliglustat involve sequential oxidation of the octanoyl \nmoiety followed by oxidation of the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxane moiety, or a combination of the \ntwo pathways, resulting in multiple oxidative metabolites. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration, the majority of the administered dose is excreted in urine (41.8%) and \nfaeces (51.4%), mainly as metabolites. After intravenous administration, eliglustat total body \nclearance was 86 L/h. After repeated oral doses of 84 mg eliglustat twice daily, eliglustat elimination \nhalf-life is approximately 4-7 hours in non-PMs and 9 hours in PMs. \n \nCharacteristics in specific groups \n \nCYP2D6 phenotype \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the CYP2D6 predicted phenotype based on genotype \nis the most important factor affecting pharmacokinetic variability. Individuals with a CYP2D6 poor \nmetaboliser predicted phenotype (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher eliglustat \nconcentrations than intermediate or extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers. \n \nGender, body weight, age, and race \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, body weight, age, and race had limited or \nno impact on the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat. \n \nHepatic impairment:    \nEffects of mild and moderate hepatic impairment were evaluated in a single dose phase 1 study. After \na single 84 mg dose, eliglustat Cmax and AUC were 1.2- and 1.2-fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment, and 2.8- and 5.2-fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive \n\n\n\n15 \n\nmetabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy CYP2D6 extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs).  \n \nAfter repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of Cerdelga, Cmax and AUC0-12 are predicted to be 2.4- and 2.9-\nfold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment and 6.4- and 8.9-\nfold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to \nhealthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs). \n \nAfter repeated 84 mg once daily doses of Cerdelga, Cmax and AUC0-24 are predicted to be 3.1- and 3.2 -\nfold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to \nhealthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs ) receiving Cerdelga 84 mg twice daily (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4).  \nSteady state PK exposure could not be predicted in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and poor \nmetabolisers (PMs) with mild and moderate hepatic impairment due to limited or no single-dose data. \nThe effect of severe hepatic impairment was not studied in subjects with any CYP2D6 phenotype (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment:   \nEffect of severe renal impairment was evaluated in a single dose phase 1 study. After a single 84 mg \ndose, eliglustat Cmax and AUC were similar in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe \nrenal impairment and healthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs).  \n \nLimited or no data were available in patients with ESRD and in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers \n(IMs) or poor metabolisers(PMs)  with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe principal target organs for eliglustat in toxicology studies are the GI tract, lymphoid organs, the \nliver in rat only and, in the male rat only, the reproductive system. Effects of eliglustat in toxicology \nstudies were reversible and exhibited no evidence of delayed or recurring toxicity. Safety margins for \nthe chronic rat and dog studies ranged between 8-fold and 15-fold using total plasma exposure and 1- \nto 2-fold using unbound (free fraction) plasma exposures. \n \nEliglustat did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. Concentration-dependent cardiac \neffects were observed in nonclinical studies: inhibition of human cardiac ion channels, including \npotassium, sodium, and calcium, at concentrations \u2265 7-fold of predicted human Cmax; sodium ion \nchannel-mediated effects in an ex-vivo electrophysiology study in dog Purkinje fibres (2-fold of \npredicted human unbound plasma Cmax); and increases in QRS and PR intervals in dog telemetry and \ncardiac conduction studies in anaesthesised dogs, with effects seen at concentrations 14-fold of \npredicted human total plasma Cmax, or 2-fold of predicted human unbound plasma Cmax. \n   \nEliglustat was not mutagenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests and did not show any \ncarcinogenic potential in standard lifetime bioassays in mice and rats. Exposures in the carcinogenicity \nstudies were approximately 4-fold and 3-fold greater in mice and rats, respectively, than the mean \npredicted human eliglustat total plasma exposure, or less than 1-fold using unbound plasma exposure. \n \nIn mature male rats, no effects on sperm parameters were observed at systemically non-toxic doses. \nReversible inhibition of spermatogenesis was observed in the rat at 10-fold of predicted human \nexposure based on AUC, a systemically toxic dose. In rat repeated dose toxicity studies, seminiferous \nepithelial degeneration and segmental hypoplasia of the testes was seen at 10-fold of predicted human \nexposure based on AUC. \n \nPlacental transfer of eliglustat and its metabolites was shown in the rat. At 2 and 24 hours post-dose, \n0.034 % and 0.013 % of labelled dose was detected in foetal tissue, respectively. \n \nAt maternal toxic doses in rats, foetuses showed a higher incidence of dilated cerebral ventricles, \nabnormal number of ribs or lumbar vertebrae, and many bones showed poor ossification. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nEmbryofoetal development in rats and rabbits was not affected up to clinically relevant exposure \n(based on AUC). \n \nA lactation study in the rat showed that 0.23% of labelled dose was transferred to pups during 24 \nhours post-dose, indicating milk excretion of eliglustat and/or its related materials.   \n \n \n6.

CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \n\nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT   \n \n\u2022 Risk management plan (RMP) \n\n \nThe marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance \nactivities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the \nmarketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. \n \nAn updated RMP should be submitted: \n\n\u2022 At the request of the European Medicines Agency; \n\u2022 Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information \n\nbeing received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of \nan important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. \n\n \n \n\u2022 Additional risk minimisation measures \n \nPrior to launch of Cerdelga in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must \nagree the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, \ndistribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent \nAuthority.  \n\nThe MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Cerdelga is marketed, all healthcare \nprofessionals who are expected to prescribe Cerdelga are provided with a prescriber guide.  \n\nThe prescriber guide shall contain the following key elements: \n\no Cerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease \ntype 1 (GD1).  \n\n\n\n20 \n\no Before initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 \nto determine the CYP2D6 metaboliser status. Cerdelga is indicated in patients who are \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs). \n\no The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate \nmetabolisers (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). The recommended dose is 84 mg \neliglustat once daily in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs).  \n\no Patients should be informed that consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be avoided. \n\no Eliglustat is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) \nor extensive metabolisers (EMs) who are taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor \nconcomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor.  Eliglustat is also \ncontraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor. Use of eliglustat under these conditions results in substantially elevated \nplasma concentrations of eliglustat. This may cause mild increases in the PR, QRS, and \nQTc intervals. \n\no Use of eliglustat with strong CYP3A inducers substantially decreases the exposure to \neliglustat, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness; therefore concomitant \nadministration is not recommended. Use of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with eliglustat is \nnot recommended in PMs. \n\no A dose of eliglustat 84 mg once daily should be considered when a strong CYP2D6 \ninhibitor is used concomitantly in intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and extensive \nmetabolisers (EMs). \n\no Caution should be used with moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors in intermediate metabolisers \n(IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). Caution should be used with strong or moderate \nCYP3A inhibitors in intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). \nCaution should be used with weak CYP3A inhibitors in poor metabolisers (PMs).  \n\no In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe hepatic impairment, Cerdelga is \ncontraindicated. In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, Cerdelga is \ncontraindicated. \n\no In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment taking a weak \nCYP2D6 inhibitor or a strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of 84 mg \neliglustat once daily should be considered. \n\no In CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs) with any degree \nof hepatic impairment, Cerdelga is not recommended. \n\nThe MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Cerdelga is marketed, all patients who are \nprescribed Cerdelga are provided with a patient alert card. The patient alert card shall contain the \nfollowing key elements: \n\nInformation for healthcare professionals: \n\no This patient is using eliglustat (Cerdelga) for the treatment of Gaucher Disease type 1.  \n\no Eliglustat should not be used concomitantly with medicines that may have an impact on \nliver enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of eliglustat. In addition, patient\u2019s \nhepatic or renal status may have an impact on the metabolism of eliglustat. \n\n\n\n21 \n\no Using eliglustat together with such products or in patients with hepatic or renal \nimpairment may either make eliglustat less effective, or it may increase the eliglustat \nlevels in the patient\u2019s blood.  \n\nInformation for the patient: \n\no Always consult the doctor who prescribed eliglustat before you start using other \nmedicines.  \n\n o Do not consume grapefruit products.  \n\n\u2022 Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measure  \n\nThe MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measure: \n\nDescription Due date \n\nIn order to investigate the long-term safety of eliglustat in patients prescribed eliglustat, the \nMAH is to create a sub-registry to the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) \nGaucher Registry to collect safety data according to an agreed protocol.  \n\nReports from the sub-\nregistry are to be \nsubmitted with each \nPSUR.  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nANNEX III \n\n \nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nCerdelga 84 mg hard capsules  \n\neliglustat  \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Cerdelga is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Cerdelga \n3. How to take Cerdelga  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Cerdelga  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cerdelga is and what it is used for \n \nCerdelga contains the active substance eliglustat and is used for the long term treatment of adult \npatients with Gaucher disease type 1. \n \nGaucher disease type 1 is a rare, inherited condition in which a substance called glucosylceramide is \nnot effectively broken down by your body. As a result glucosylceramide builds up in your spleen, liver \nand bones. The build-up prevents these organs from working properly. Cerdelga contains the active \nsubstance eliglustat which decreases the production of glucosylceramide, thereby preventing its build-\nup. In turn this helps your affected organs to work better. \n \nPeople differ in the speed that their body breaks down this medicine. As a result the amount of this \nmedicine in the blood can differ between patients which could affect how a patient would respond. \nCerdelga is meant to be used in patients whose body breaks down this medicine at normal speed \n(known as intermediate metabolisers and extensive metabolisers) or slow speed (known as poor \nmetabolisers). Your doctor will determine if Cerdelga is suitable for you before you start taking it, \nusing a simple laboratory test. \n \nGaucher disease type 1 is a lifelong condition and you must continue to take this medicine as \nprescribed by your doctor to gain the maximum benefit from your medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cerdelga  \n \nDo not take Cerdelga \n\n- If you are allergic to eliglustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- If you are an intermediate or extensive metaboliser and use medicines  known as strong or \nmoderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (examples are quinidine and terbinafine) used in combination \n\n\n\n31 \n\nwith strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (examples are erythromycin and itraconazole). The \ncombination of these medicines will interfere with your body\u2019s ability to break down Cerdelga \nand this can result in higher levels of the active substance in your blood (see the section \u2018Other \nmedicines and Cerdelga\u2019 for an expanded list of medicines). \n\n- If you are a poor metaboliser and use medicines known as strong CYP3A inhibitors (for \nexample itraconazole). Medicines of this type will interfere with your body\u2019s abilty to break \ndown Cerdelga and this can result in higher levels of the active substance in your blood (see \nthe section \u2018Other medicines and Cerdelga\u2019 for an expanded list of medicines). \n\n- If you are an extensive metaboliser and you have severely reduced liver function. \n- If you are an extensive metaboliser and you have mildly or moderately reduced liver function \n\nwhile taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cerdelga, if you: \n\n\u2022  are currently treated, or about to start treatment with any of the medicines listed in section \n\u2018Other medicines and Cerdelga.\u2019 \n\n\u2022 have had a heart attack or heart failure. \n\u2022 have a slow heart rate. \n\u2022 have an irregular, or abnormal heart beat, inluding a heart condition called long QT syndrome. \n\u2022 have any other heart problems. \n\u2022 are taking an antiarrhythmic medicine (used to treat irregular heart beat) like quinidine, \n\namiodarone or sotalol. \n\u2022 are an extensive metaboliser and you have moderately reduced liver function. \n\u2022 are an intermediate or poor metaboliser and you have any level of reduced liver function. \n\u2022 are an intermediate or poor metaboliser and you have reduced kidney function.  \n\u2022 are an end stage renal disease (ESRD) patient. \n\n  \nChildren and adolescents \nCerdelga has not been tested in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Do not give this \nmedicine to children or adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Cerdelga \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, or have recently used, or might use, any other \nmedicines. \n \nMedicines that must not be taken in combination with each other and Cerdelga \nCerdelga must not be used with certain type of medicines. These medicines can interfere with your \nbody\u2019s ability to break down Cerdelga and this can result in higher levels of Cerdelga in your blood. \nThese medicines are known as strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors and strong or moderate CYP3A \ninhibitors. There are many medicines in these categories and depending on how your body breaks \ndown Cerdelga the effects may differ from person to person. Please speak to your doctor regarding \nthese medicines before you start taking Cerdelga. Your doctor will determine which medicines you \ncan use based on how fast your body breaks down eliglustat. \n \nMedicines that may increase the level of Cerdelga in the blood such as: \n\n\u2022 paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, duloxetine, bupropion, moclobemide \u2013 antidepressants \n(used to treat depression) \n\n\u2022 dronedarone, quinidine, verapamil \u2013 antiarrhythmic medicines (used to treat irregular \nheartbeat) \n\n\u2022 ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin \u2013 antibiotics (used to treat \ninfections) \n\n\u2022 terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole \u2013 antifungals (used to treat \nfungal infections) \n\n\u2022 mirabegron \u2013 used to treat overactive bladders \n\u2022 cinacalcet \u2013 calcimimetic (used in some dialysis patients and specific cancers) \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\u2022 atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir \u2013 \nantiretrovirals (used to treat HIV) \n\n\u2022 cobicistat \u2013 used to improve the effects of antiretrovirals (used to treat HIV) \n\u2022 aprepitant \u2013 antiemetic (used to reduce vomiting) \n\u2022 diltiazem \u2013 antihypertensive (used to increase blood flow and decrease heart rate) \n\u2022 conivaptan \u2013 diuretic (used to increase low blood sodium levels) \n\u2022 boceprevir, telaprevir \u2013 antiviral (used to treat Hepatitis C) \n\u2022 imatinib \u2013 anticancer (used to treat cancer) \n\u2022 amlopidine, ranolazine  \u2013  used to treat angina pectoris  \n\u2022 cilostazol \u2013 used to treat cramp-like pain in your legs when you walk caused by insufficient \n\nblood supply in your legs \n\u2022 isoniazid \u2013 used to treat tuberculosis. \n\u2022 cimetidine, ranitidine \u2013 antacids (used to treat indigestion) \n\u2022 goldenseal \u2013 (also known as Hydrastis canadensis) a herbal preparation obtained without a \n\nprescription, used as a digestive aid. \n \nMedicines that may decrease the level of Cerdelga in the blood: \n\n\u2022 rifampicin, rifabutin \u2013 antibiotics (used to treat infections) \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \u2013anti-epileptics (used to treat epilepsy and seizures) \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort \u2013 (also known as Hypericum perforatum) a herbal preparation obtained \n\nwithout a prescription, used to treat depression and other conditions  \n \nCerdelga may increase the level of the following types of medicines in the blood: \n\n\u2022 dabigatran \u2013 anticoagulant (used to thin the blood) \n\u2022 phenytoin \u2013 anti-epileptic (used to treat epilepsy and seizures) \n\u2022 nortryptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine \u2013 antidepressants (used to treat \n\ndepression) \n\u2022 phenothiazines \u2013 antipsychotics (used to treat schizophrenia and psychosis) \n\u2022 digoxin \u2013used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation \n\u2022 colchicine \u2013 used to treat gout \n\u2022 metoprolol \u2013 used to lower blood pressure and/or reduce heart rate \n\u2022 dextromethorphan \u2013 cough medicine \n\u2022 atomoxetine \u2013 used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \n\u2022 pravastatin \u2013 used to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease \n\n \nTaking Cerdelga with food and drink \nAvoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice since it may increase the level of Cerdelga in your \nblood. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor \nwho will discuss with you whether you can take this medicine during your pregnancy. \n \nThe active substance in this medicine has been shown to pass in trace amounts into breast milk in \nanimals.

adult patients with gaucher disease type 1. gaucher disease type 1 is a rare, inherited condition in which a substance called glucosylceramide is not effectively broken down by your body. as a result glucosylceramide builds up in your spleen, liver and bones. the build-up prevents these organs from working properly. cerdelga contains the active substance eliglustat which decreases the production of glucosylceramide, thereby preventing its build- up. in turn this helps your affected organs to work better. people differ in the speed that their body breaks down this medicine. as a result the amount of this medicine in the blood can differ between patients which could affect how a patient would respond. cerdelga is meant to be used in patients whose body breaks down this medicine at normal speed (known as intermediate metabolisers and extensive metabolisers) or slow speed (known as poor metabolisers). your doctor will determine if cerdelga is suitable for you before you start taking it, using a simple laboratory test. gaucher disease type 1 is a lifelong condition and you must continue to take this medicine as prescribed by your doctor to gain the maximum benefit from your medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "cerdelga", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 4, "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 8, "Score": 0.5944847464561462, "Text":
