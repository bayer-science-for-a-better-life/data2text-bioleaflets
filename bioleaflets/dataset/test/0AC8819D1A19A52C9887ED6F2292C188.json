NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZYTIGA 250 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 250 mg of abiraterone acetate.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach tablet contains 189 mg of lactose and 6.8 mg of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet\nWhite to off-white oval tablets (15.9 mm long x 9.5 mm wide), debossed with AA250 on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZYTIGA is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for:\n\uf0b7 the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer \n\n(mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see section \n5.1)\n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are \nasymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom \nchemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1)\n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a \ndocetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThis medicinal product should be prescribed by an appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken \nwith food (see \u201cMethod of administration\u201d below). Taking the tablets with food increases systemic \nexposure to abiraterone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nDosage of prednisone or prednisolone\nFor mHSPC, ZYTIGA is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily. \n\nFor mCRPC, ZYTIGA is used with 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.\n\nMedical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be continued \nduring treatment in patients not surgically castrated.\n\nRecommended monitoring\nSerum transaminases should be measured prior to starting treatment, every two weeks for the first \nthree months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Blood pressure, serum potassium and fluid retention \nshould be monitored monthly. However, patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure \n\n\n\n3\n\nshould be monitored every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn patients with pre-existing hypokalaemia or those that develop hypokalaemia whilst being treated \nwith ZYTIGA, consider maintaining the patient\u2019s potassium level at \u2265 4.0 mM.\nFor patients who develop Grade \u2265 3 toxicities including hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and \nother non-mineralocorticoid toxicities, treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical \nmanagement should be instituted. Treatment with ZYTIGA should not be reinitiated until symptoms \nof the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.\nIn the event of a missed daily dose of either ZYTIGA, prednisone or prednisolone, treatment should be \nresumed the following day with the usual daily dose.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nFor patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increases \nor aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increases above 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), \ntreatment should be withheld immediately (see section 4.4). Re-treatment following return of liver \nfunction tests to the patient\u2019s baseline may be given at a reduced dose of 500 mg (two tablets) once \ndaily. For patients being re-treated, serum transaminases should be monitored at a minimum of every \ntwo weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of \n500 mg daily, treatment should be discontinued.\n\nIf patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, \ntreatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh \nClass A.\n\nModerate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure \nto abiraterone by approximately four-fold following single oral doses of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg \n(see section 5.2). There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone \nacetate when administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass B or C). No dose adjustment can be predicted. The use of ZYTIGA should be cautiously \nassessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh \nthe possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). ZYTIGA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). However, there \nis no clinical experience in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is \nadvised in these patients (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of ZYTIGA in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nZYTIGA is for oral use.\nThe tablets should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours after eating. These should be \nswallowed whole with water.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Women who are or may potentially be pregnant (see section 4.6).\n- Severe hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh Class C (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2)].\n- ZYTIGA with prednisone or prednisolone is contraindicated in combination with Ra-223.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypertension, hypokalaemia, fluid retention and cardiac failure due to mineralocorticoid excess\nZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention (see section 4.8) as a \nconsequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition (see section 5.1). \nCo-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting \nin a reduction in incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Caution is required in treating \npatients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, \nhypokalaemia (e.g., those on cardiac glycosides), or fluid retention (e.g., those with heart failure, \nsevere or unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia and those \nwith severe renal impairment).\n\nZYTIGA should be used with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The Phase 3 \nstudies conducted with ZYTIGA excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically \nsignificant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the \npast 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III or IV \nheart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection \nfraction measurement of < 50%. In studies 3011 and 302, patients with atrial fibrillation, or other \ncardiac arrhythmia requiring medical therapy were excluded. Safety in patients with left ventricular \nejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (in study 301) or NYHA \nClass II to IV heart failure (in studies 3011 and 302) was not established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nBefore treating patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure (e.g.a history of cardiac \nfailure, uncontrolled hypertension, or cardiac events such as ischaemic heart disease), consider \nobtaining an assessment of cardiac function (e.g. echocardiogram). Before treatment with ZYTIGA, \ncardiac failure should be treated and cardiac function optimised. Hypertension, hypokalaemia and \nfluid retention should be corrected and controlled. During treatment, blood pressure, serum potassium, \nfluid retention (weight gain, peripheral oedema), and other signs and symptoms of congestive heart \nfailure should be monitored every 2 weeks for 3 months, then monthly thereafter and abnormalities \ncorrected. QT prolongation has been observed in patients experiencing hypokalaemia in association \nwith ZYTIGA treatment. Assess cardiac function as clinically indicated, institute appropriate \nmanagement and consider discontinuation of this treatment if there is a clinically significant decrease \nin cardiac function (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment\nMarked increases in liver enzymes leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification occurred \nin controlled clinical studies (see section 4.8). Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to \nstarting treatment, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment, and monthly thereafter. If \nclinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop, serum transaminases should be \nmeasured immediately. If at any time the ALT or AST rises above 5 times the ULN, treatment should \nbe interrupted immediately and liver function closely monitored. Re-treatment may take place only \nafter return of liver function tests to the patient\u2019s baseline and at a reduced dose level (see section 4.2).\n\nIf patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, \ntreatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.\n\nPatients with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis were excluded from clinical trials; thus, there are no \ndata to support the use of ZYTIGA in this population.\n\nThere are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate when \nadministered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). The \nuse of ZYTIGA should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom \nthe benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). ZYTIGA should not be \nused in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of acute liver failure and hepatitis fulminant, some with \nfatal outcome (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n5\n\nCorticosteroid withdrawal and coverage of stress situations\nCaution is advised and monitoring for adrenocortical insufficiency should occur if patients are \nwithdrawn from prednisone or prednisolone. If ZYTIGA is continued after corticosteroids are \nwithdrawn, patients should be monitored for symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess (see information \nabove).\n\nIn patients on prednisone or prednisolone who are subjected to unusual stress, an increased dose of \ncorticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after the stressful situation.\n\nBone density\nDecreased bone density may occur in men with metastatic advanced prostate cancer. The use of \nZYTIGA in combination with a glucocorticoid could increase this effect.\n\nPrior use of ketoconazole\nLower rates of response might be expected in patients previously treated with ketoconazole for \nprostate cancer.\n\nHyperglycaemia\nThe use of glucocorticoids could increase hyperglycaemia, therefore blood sugar should be measured \nfrequently in patients with diabetes.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nCases of hypoglycaemia have been reported when ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone was \nadministered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving pioglitazone or repaglinide (see section \n4.5); therefore, blood sugar should be monitored in patients with diabetes.\n\nUse with chemotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant use of ZYTIGA with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1).\n\nIntolerance to excipients\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. This medicinal product also contains more than 1 mmol (or 27.2 mg) sodium per dose of \nfour tablets. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nPotential risks\nAnaemia and sexual dysfunction may occur in men with metastatic prostate cancer including those \nundergoing treatment with ZYTIGA.\n\nSkeletal muscle effects\nCases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated with ZYTIGA. Most \ncases developed within the first 6 months of treatment and recovered after ZYTIGA withdrawal. \nCaution is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nStrong inducers of CYP3A4 during treatment are to be avoided unless there is no therapeutic \nalternative, due to risk of decreased exposure to abiraterone (see section 4.5).\n\nCombination of abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone with Ra-223\nTreatment with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone in combination with Ra-223 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3) due to an increased risk of fractures and a trend for increased \nmortality among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic prostate cancer patients as observed in clinical \ntrials.\n\n\n\n6\n\nIt is recommended that subsequent treatment with Ra-223 is not initiated for at least 5 days after the \nlast administration of ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone/prednisolone. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of food on abiraterone acetate\nAdministration with food significantly increases the absorption of abiraterone acetate. The efficacy \nand safety when given with food have not been established therefore this medicinal product must not \nbe taken with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect abiraterone exposures\nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 \ninducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, \nthe mean plasma AUC\u221e of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.\n\nStrong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, \nphenobarbital, St John's wort [Hypericum perforatum]) during treatment are to be avoided, unless \nthere is no therapeutic alternative.\n\nIn a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects, co-administration of \nketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the \npharmacokinetics of abiraterone.\n\nPotential to affect exposures to other medicinal products\nAbiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolising enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.\nIn a study to determine the effects of abiraterone acetate (plus prednisone) on a single dose of the \nCYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan, the systemic exposure (AUC) of dextromethorphan was \nincreased approximately 2.9 fold. The AUC24 for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of \ndextromethorphan, increased approximately 33%.\n\nCaution is advised when administering with medicinal products activated by or metabolised by \nCYP2D6, particularly with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index. Dose reduction of \nmedicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolised by CYP2D6 should be \nconsidered. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 include metoprolol, \npropranolol, desipramine, venlafaxine, haloperidol, risperidone, propafenone, flecainide, codeine, \noxycodone and tramadol (the latter three medicinal products requiring CYP2D6 to form their active \nanalgesic metabolites).\n\nIn a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone was increased by \n46% and the AUCs for M-III and M-IV, the active metabolites of pioglitazone, each decreased by 10% \nwhen pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Patients \nshould be monitored for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic \nindex if used concomitantly. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8 include \npioglitazone and repaglinide (see section 4.4).\n\nIn vitro, the major metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate were shown to \ninhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence it may increase the \nconcentrations of medicinal products eliminated by OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to \nconfirm transporter based interaction.\n\nUse with products known to prolong QT interval\nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, caution is advised when \nadministering ZYTIGA with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal \nproducts able to induce torsades de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III \n(e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, \nmoxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc.\n\n\n\n7\n\nUse with Spironolactone\nSpironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. \nUse with ZYTIGA is not recommended (see section 5.1).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nThere are no human data on the use of ZYTIGA in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use \nin women of childbearing potential.\n\nContraception in males and females\nIt is not known whether abiraterone or its metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required if \nthe patient is engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient is engaged in sex with a \nwoman of childbearing potential, a condom is required along with another effective contraceptive \nmethod. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nPregnancy\nZYTIGA is not for use in women and is contraindicated in women who are or may potentially be \npregnant (see section 4.3 and 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nZYTIGA is not for use in women.\n\nFertility\nAbiraterone affected fertility in male and female rats, but these effects were fully reversible (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZYTIGA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with ZYTIGA, adverse reactions that \nwere observed in \u226510% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension, urinary tract \ninfection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased.\nOther important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic \nalveolitis.\n\nZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic \nconsequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse \nreactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients treated \nwith placebo: hypokalaemia 18% vs. 8%, hypertension 22% vs. 16% and fluid retention (peripheral \noedema) 23% vs. 17%, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate versus patients treated \nwith placebo: CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6% versus 1%, \nCTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 7% versus 5%, and fluid \nretention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1% versus 1% of patients, \nrespectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. \nConcomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nIn studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or \nwere previously treated with orchiectomy, ZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in \n\n\n\n8\n\ncombination with low dose prednisone or prednisolone (either 5 or 10 mg daily depending on the \nindication).\n\nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed below by \nfrequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions identified in clinical studies and post-marketing\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction and frequency\nInfections and infestations very common: urinary tract infection\n\ncommon: sepsis\nImmune system disorders not known: anaphylactic reactions\nEndocrine disorders uncommon: adrenal insufficiency\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders very common: hypokalaemia\n\ncommon: hypertriglyceridaemia\nCardiac disorders common: cardiac failure*, angina pectoris, \n\natrial fibrillation, tachycardia\nuncommon: other arrhythmias\nnot known: myocardial infarction,\nQT prolongation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)\n\nVascular disorders very common: hypertension\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nrare: allergic alveolitisa\n\nGastrointestinal disorders very common: diarrhoea\ncommon: dyspepsia\n\nHepatobiliary disorders very common: alanine aminotransferase \nincreased and/or aspartate aminotransferase \nincreased b\n\nrare: hepatitis fulminant, acute hepatic failure\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders common: rash\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\nuncommon: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis\n\nRenal and urinary disorders common: haematuria\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions\n\nvery common: oedema peripheral\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications\n\ncommon: fractures**\n\n* Cardiac failure also includes congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction decreased\n** Fractures includes osteoporosis and all fractures with the exception of pathological fractures\na Spontaneous reports from post-marketing experience\nb Alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased includes ALT increased, AST \n\nincreased, and hepatic function abnormal.\n\nThe following CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with \nabiraterone acetate: hypokalaemia 5%; urinary tract infection 2%; alanine aminotransferase increased\nand/or aspartate aminotransferase increased 4%; hypertension 6%; fractures 2%; peripheral oedema, \ncardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation 1% each. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia \nand angina pectoris occurred in < 1% of patients. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 4 urinary tract infection, \nalanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypokalemia, cardiac \nfailure, atrial fibrillation, and fractures occurred in < 1% of patients.\n\nA higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive \npopulation (study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive \npopulation (study 3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively. \n\n\n\n9\n\nHypokalemia was observed in 20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) \ncompared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 301 and 302, respectively). \n\nThe incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroup of patients with baseline \nECOG2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (\u226575 years).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nCardiovascular reactions\nThe three Phase 3 studies excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant heart \ndisease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, \nsevere or unstable angina, or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart \nfailure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of < 50%. All patients enrolled \n(both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen deprivation \ntherapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with diabetes, \nmyocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of \ncardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus \npatients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, \nangina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nHepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with \nabiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST \nincreases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of \npatients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. \nIn Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with ZYTIGA.\nTen patients who received ZYTIGA were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; two had Grade 2 \nhepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. No patient died of \nhepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose baseline ALT or AST \nwere elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than those beginning with \nnormal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations in bilirubin \n> 3 x ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two instances marked \nincreases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with normal baseline \nhepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin elevations 2 to \n6 x ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their liver function \ntests and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, Grade 3 or 4 \nALT or AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone acetate. \nAminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver metastases and 1 \nwith AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate). In Phase 3 \nclinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic \nfunction were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% of patients treated \nwith placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.\n\nIn clinical trials, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline \nhepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 trial, patients with baseline \nALT and AST > 2.5 X ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 X ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral \nhepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were\nexcluded. In the 301 trial, patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver \nmetastases and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 trial, patients \nwith liver metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN were \nexcluded. Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical trials were \nvigorously managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return \nof liver function tests to the patient\u2019s baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or \nAST > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The \nmechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood.\n\n\n\n10\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of overdose with ZYTIGA is limited.\n\nThere is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, administration should be withheld and \ngeneral supportive measures undertaken, including monitoring for arrhythmias, hypokalaemia and for \nsigns and symptoms of fluid retention. Liver function also should be assessed.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, other hormone antagonists and related agents, ATC \ncode: L02BX03\n\nMechanism of action\nAbiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. \nSpecifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This \nenzyme is expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal and prostatic \ntumour tissues. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone \nprecursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the \nC17,20 bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals \n(see section 4.4).\n\nAndrogen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. \nAndrogen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with LHRH analogues or orchiectomy, decrease \nandrogen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the \ntumour. Treatment with ZYTIGA decreases serum testosterone to undetectable levels (using \ncommercial assays) when given with LHRH analogues (or orchiectomy).\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nZYTIGA decreases serum testosterone and other androgens to levels lower than those achieved by the \nuse of LHRH analogues alone or by orchiectomy. This results from the selective inhibition of the \nCYP17 enzyme required for androgen biosynthesis. PSA serves as a biomarker in patients with \nprostate cancer. In a Phase 3 clinical study of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with taxanes, \n38% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate, versus 10% of patients treated with placebo, had at \nleast a 50% decline from baseline in PSA levels.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nEfficacy was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre Phase 3 clinical studies\n(studies 3011, 302 and 301) of patients with mHSPC and mCRPC. Study 3011 enrolled patients who \nwere newly diagnosed (within 3 months of randomization) mHSPC who had high-risk prognostic \nfactors. High-risk prognosis was defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) \nGleason score of \u22658; (2) presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) presence of measurable \nvisceral (excluding lymph node disease) metastasis. In the active arm, ZYTIGA was administered at a \ndose of 1000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone 5 mg once daily in addition to ADT \n(LHRH agonist or orchiectomy), which was the standard of care treatment. Patients in the control arm \nreceived ADT and placebos for both ZYTIGA and prednisone. Study 302 enrolled docetaxel na\u00efve \npatients; whereas, study 301 enrolled patients who had received prior docetaxel. Patients were using \nan LHRH analogue or were previously treated with orchiectomy. In the active treatment arm, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Control patients received placebo and low dose prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg twice daily.\n\nChanges in PSA serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. Therefore, \nin all studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until \ndiscontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study.\n\nIn all studies spironolactone use was not allowed as spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and \nmay increase PSA levels.\n\nStudy 3011 (patients with newly diagnosed high risk mHSPC)\nIn Study 3011, (n=1199) the median age of enrolled patients was 67 years. The number of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA by racial group was Caucasian 832 (69.4%), Asian 246 (20.5%), Black or \nAfrican American 25 (2.1%), other 80 (6.7%), unknown/not reported 13 (1.1%), and American Indian \nor Alaska Native 3 (0.3%). The ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 for 97% of patients. Patients \nwith known brain metastasis, uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or NYHA Class II-\nIV heart failure were excluded. Patients that were treated with prior pharmacotherapy, radiation \ntherapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer were excluded with the exception of up to 3 months \nof ADT or 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat symptoms resulting from \nmetastatic disease. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic \nprogression-free survival (rPFS). The median baseline pain score, as measured by the Brief Pain \nInventory Short Form (BPI-SF) was 2.0 in both the treatment and Placebo groups. In addition to the \nco-primary endpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to skeletal-related event (SRE), \ntime to subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to pain \nprogression, and time to PSA progression. Treatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal \nof consent, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or death.\n\nRadiographic progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence \nof radiographic progression or death from any cause. Radiographic progression included progression \nby bone scan (according to modified PCWG2) or progression of soft tissue lesions by CT or MRI \n(according to RECIST 1.1).\n\nA significant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 2 and Figure 1).\n\nTable 2: Radiographic Progression-Free Survival \u2013 Stratified Analysis; Intent-to-treat Population \n(Study PCR3011)\n\nAA-P Placebo\nSubjects randomised 597 602\n\nEvent 239 (40.0%) 354 (58.8%)\nCensored 358 (60.0%) 248 (41.2%)\n\nTime to Event (months)\nMedian (95% CI) 33.02 (29.57, NE) 14.78 (14.69, 18.27)\nRange (0.0+, 41.0+) (0.0+, 40.6+)\n\np valuea < 0.0001\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.466 (0.394, 0.550)\n\nNote: += censored observation, NE=not estimable.

The treatment effect of AA-P on rPFS \nand OS across the pre-specified subgroups was favorable and consistent with the overall study \npopulation, except for the subgroup of ECOG score of 2 where no trend towards benefit was observed, \nhowever the small sample size (n=40) limits drawing any meaningful conclusion.\n\nIn addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for \nZYTIGA vs. placebo treatment in all prospectively-defined secondary endpoints.\n\nStudy 302 (chemotherapy na\u00efve patients)\nThis study enrolled chemotherapy na\u00efve patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and \nfor whom chemotherapy was not yet clinically indicated. A score of 0-1 on Brief Pain Inventory-Short \nForm (BPI-SF) worst pain in last 24 hours was considered asymptomatic, and a score of 2-3 was \nconsidered mildly symptomatic.\n\nIn study 302, (n = 1,088) the median age of enrolled patients was 71 years for patients treated with \nZYTIGA plus prednisone or prednisolone and 70 years for patients treated with placebo plus \nprednisone or prednisolone. The number of patients treated with ZYTIGA by racial group was \nCaucasian 520 (95.4%), Black 15 (2.8%), Asian 4 (0.7%) and other 6 (1.1%). The Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of patients in \nboth arms. Fifty percent of patients had only bone metastases, an additional 31% of patients had bone \nand soft tissue or lymph node metastases and 19% of patients had only soft tissue or lymph node \nmetastases. Patients with visceral metastases were excluded. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were \noverall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). In addition to the co-primary \nendpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to opiate use for cancer pain, time to initiation \nof cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point and time to \nPSA progression based on Prostate Cancer Working Group-2 (PCWG2) criteria. Study treatments \nwere discontinued at the time of unequivocal clinical progression. Treatments could also be \ndiscontinued at the time of confirmed radiographic progression at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n\n\n14\n\nRadiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies \nas defined by PCWG2 criteria (for bone lesions) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid \nTumors (RECIST) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). Analysis of rPFS utilised centrally-reviewed \nradiographic assessment of progression.\n\nAt the planned rPFS analysis there were 401 events, 150 (28%) of patients treated with ZYTIGA and \n251 (46%) of patients treated with placebo had radiographic evidence of progression or had died. A \nsignificant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 4 and Figure 3).\n\nTable 4: Study 302: Radiographic progression-free survival of patients treated with either \nZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH \nanalogues or prior orchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 546)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 542)\n\nRadiographic \nProgression-free Survival \n\n(rPFS)\nProgression or death 150 (28%) 251 (46%)\n\nMedian rPFS in months\n(95% CI)\n\nNot reached\n(11.66; NE)\n\n8.3\n(8.12; 8.54)\n\np-value* < 0.0001\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.425 (0.347; 0.522)\n\nNE = Not estimated\n* p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by baseline ECOG score (0 or 1)\n** Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan Meier curves of radiographic progression-free survival in patients treated \nwith either ZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone \nplus LHRH analogues or prior orchiectomy\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\nHowever, subject data continued to be collected through the date of the second interim analysis of \nOverall survival (OS).

The study was \nunblinded based on the magnitude of clinical benefit observed and patients in the placebo group were \noffered treatment with ZYTIGA. Overall survival was longer for ZYTIGA than placebo with a 25% \n\n\n\n16\n\nreduction in risk of death (HR = 0.752; 95% CI: [0.606; 0.934], p = 0.0097), but OS was not mature \nand interim results did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for statistical significance (see \nTable 4). Survival continued to be followed after this IA.\n\nThe planned final analysis for OS was conducted after 741 deaths were observed (median follow up of \n49 months). Sixty-five percent (354 of 546) of patients treated with ZYTIGA, compared with 71% \n(387 of 542) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A statistically significant OS benefit in favour \nof the ZYTIGA-treated group was demonstrated with a 19.4% reduction in risk of death \n(HR = 0.806; 95% CI: [0.697; 0.931], p = 0.0033) and an improvement in median OS of 4.4 months \n(ZYTIGA 34.7 months, placebo 30.3 months) (see Table 6 and Figure 5). This improvement was \ndemonstrated even though 44% of patients in the placebo arm received ZYTIGA as subsequent \ntherapy.\n\nTable 6: Study 302: Overall survival of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 546)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 542)\n\nInterim survival analysis\nDeaths (%) 147 (27%) 186 (34%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\nNot reached\n(NE; NE)\n\n27.2\n(25.95; NE)\n\np-value* 0.0097\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.752 (0.606; 0.934)\nFinal survival analysis\n\nDeaths 354 (65%) 387 (71%)\nMedian overall survival in \n\nmonths (95% CI)\n34.7 (32.7; 36.8) 30.3 (28.7; 33.3)\n\np-value* 0.0033\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.806 (0.697; 0.931)\n\nNE = Not Estimated\n* p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by baseline ECOG score (0 or 1)\n** Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n17\n\nFigure 5: Kaplan Meier survival curves of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy, final analysis\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\nIn addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for \nZYTIGA vs. placebo treatment in all secondary endpoint measures as follows:\n\nTime to PSA progression based on PCWG2 criteria: The median time to PSA progression was \n11.1 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and 5.6 months for patients receiving placebo \n(HR = 0.488; 95% CI: [0.420; 0.568], p < 0.0001). The time to PSA progression was approximately \ndoubled with ZYTIGA treatment (HR = 0.488). The proportion of subjects with a confirmed PSA \nresponse was greater in the ZYTIGA group than in the placebo group (62% vs. 24%; p < 0.0001). In \nsubjects with measurable soft tissue disease, significantly increased numbers of complete and partial \ntumor responses were seen with ZYTIGA treatment.\n\nTime to opiate use for cancer pain: The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain at the time \nof final analysis was 33.4 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and was 23.4 months for patients \nreceiving placebo (HR = 0.721; 95% CI: [0.614; 0.846], p < 0.0001).\n\nTime to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy: The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy \nwas 25.2 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and 16.8 months for patients receiving placebo \n(HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.487; 0.691], p < 0.0001).\n\nTime to deterioration in ECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point: The median time to deterioration in \nECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point was 12.3 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and \n10.9 months for patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.821; 95% CI: [0.714; 0.943], p = 0.0053).\n\nThe following study endpoints demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in favour of ZYTIGA \ntreatment:\n\n\n\n18\n\nObjective response: Objective response was defined as the proportion of subjects with measurable \ndisease achieving a complete or partial response according to RECIST criteria (baseline lymph node \nsize was required to be \u2265 2 cm to be considered a target lesion). The proportion of subjects with \nmeasurable disease at baseline who had an objective response was 36% in the ZYTIGA group and \n16% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).\n\nPain: Treatment with ZYTIGA significantly reduced the risk of average pain intensity progression by \n18% compared with placebo (p = 0.0490). The median time to progression was 26.7 months in the \nZYTIGA group and 18.4 months in the placebo group.\n\nTime to degradation in the FACT-P (Total Score): Treatment with ZYTIGA decreased the risk of \nFACT-P (Total Score) degradation by 22% compared with placebo (p = 0.0028). The median time to \ndegradation in FACT-P (Total Score) was 12.7 months in the ZYTIGA group and 8.3 months in the \nplacebo group.\n\nStudy 301 (patients who had received prior chemotherapy)\nStudy 301 enrolled patients who had received prior docetaxel. Patients were not required to show \ndisease progression on docetaxel, as toxicity from this chemotherapy may have led to discontinuation.\nPatients were maintained on study treatments until there was PSA progression (confirmed 25% \nincrease over the patient\u2019s baseline/nadir) together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and \nsymptomatic or clinical progression. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer \nwere excluded from this study. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.\n\nThe median age of enrolled patients was 69 years (range 39-95). The number of patients treated with \nZYTIGA by racial group was Caucasian 737 (93.2%), Black 28 (3.5%), Asian 11 (1.4%) and other 14 \n(1.8%). Eleven percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance score of 2; 70% had \nradiographic evidence of disease progression with or without PSA progression; 70% had received one \nprior cytotoxic chemotherapy and 30% received two. Liver metastasis was present in 11% of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA.\n\nIn a planned analysis conducted after 552 deaths were observed, 42% (333 of 797) of patients treated \nwith ZYTIGA compared with 55% (219 of 398) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A \nstatistically significant improvement in median overall survival was seen in patients treated with \nZYTIGA (see Table 7).\n\nTable 7: Overall survival of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 797)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 398)\n\nPrimary Survival Analysis\nDeaths (%) 333 (42%) 219 (55%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\n14.8 (14.1; 15.4) 10.9 (10.2; 12.0)\n\np-valuea < 0.0001\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.646 (0.543; 0.768)\n\nUpdated Survival Analysis\nDeaths (%) 501 (63%) 274 (69%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\n15.8 (14.8; 17.0) 11.2 (10.4; 13.1)\n\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.740 (0.638; 0.859)\na p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0-1 vs. 2), pain score (absent vs. \n\npresent), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. 2), and type of disease progression (PSA only vs. \nradiographic).\n\nb Hazard ratio is derived from a stratified proportional hazards model. Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n19\n\nAt all evaluation time points after the initial few months of treatment, a higher proportion of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA remained alive, compared with the proportion of patients treated with placebo\n(see Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Kaplan Meier survival curves of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n20\n\nSubgroup survival analyses showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment with ZYTIGA (see \nFigure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Overall survival by subgroup: hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval\n\nAA = ZYTIGA; BPI = Brief Pain Inventory; C.I. = confidence interval; ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \nperformance score; HR = hazard ratio; NE = not evaluable\n\nIn addition to the observed improvement in overall survival, all secondary study endpoints favoured \nZYTIGA and were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing as follows:\n\nPatients receiving ZYTIGA demonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \n\u2265 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 38% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001.\n\nThe median time to PSA progression was 10.2 months for patients treated with ZYTIGA and \n6.6 months for patients treated with placebo (HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.462; 0.728], p < 0.0001).\n\nThe median radiographic progression-free survival was 5.6 months for patients treated with ZYTIGA \nand 3.6 months for patients who received placebo (HR = 0.673; 95% CI: [0.585; 0.776], p < 0.0001).\n\nPain\nThe proportion of patients with pain palliation was statistically significantly higher in the ZYTIGA \ngroup than in the placebo group (44% vs. 27%, p = 0.0002). A responder for pain palliation was \ndefined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain \nintensity score over the last 24 hours without any increase in analgesic usage score observed at \ntwo consecutive evaluations four weeks apart. Only patients with a baseline pain score of \u2265 4 and at \nleast one post-baseline pain score were analysed (N = 512) for pain palliation.\n\nA lower proportion of patients treated with ZYTIGA had pain progression compared to patients taking \nplacebo at 6 (22% vs. 28%), 12 (30% vs. 38%) and 18 months (35% vs. 46%). Pain progression was \ndefined as an increase from baseline of \u2265 30% in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity score over the \nprevious 24 hours without a decrease in analgesic usage score observed at two consecutive visits, or an \nincrease of \u2265 30% in analgesic usage score observed at two consecutive visits. The time to pain \nprogression at the 25th percentile was 7.4 months in the ZYTIGA group, versus 4.7 months in the \nplacebo group.\n\n\n\n21\n\nSkeletal-related events\nA lower proportion of patients in the ZYTIGA group had skeletal-related events compared with the \nplacebo group at 6 months (18% vs. 28%), 12 months (30% vs. 40%), and 18 months (35% vs. 40%). \nThe time to first skeletal-related event at the 25th percentile in the ZYTIGA group was twice that of the \ncontrol group at 9.9 months versus 4.9 months. A skeletal-related event was defined as a pathological \nfracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZYTIGA in all subsets of the paediatric population in advanced prostate cancer. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone and abiraterone \nacetate have been studied in healthy subjects, patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer and \nsubjects without cancer with hepatic or renal impairment. Abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted in \nvivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor (see section 5.1).\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of abiraterone acetate in the fasting state, the time to reach maximum \nplasma abiraterone concentration is approximately 2 hours.\n\nAdministration of abiraterone acetate with food, compared with administration in a fasted state, results \nin up to a 10-fold (AUC) and up to a 17-fold (Cmax) increase in mean systemic exposure of abiraterone, \ndepending on the fat content of the meal. Given the normal variation in the content and composition of \nmeals, taking ZYTIGA with meals has the potential to result in highly variable exposures. Therefore, \nZYTIGA must not be taken with food. It should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours \nafter eating. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nThe plasma protein binding of 14C-abiraterone in human plasma is 99.8%. The apparent volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,630 l, suggesting that abiraterone extensively distributes to peripheral \ntissues.\n\nBiotransformation\nFollowing oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolysed \nto abiraterone, which then undergoes metabolism including sulphation, hydroxylation and oxidation \nprimarily in the liver. The majority of circulating radioactivity (approximately 92%) is found in the \nform of metabolites of abiraterone. Of 15 detectable metabolites, 2 main metabolites, abiraterone \nsulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate, each represents approximately 43% of total radioactivity.\n\nElimination\nThe mean half-life of abiraterone in plasma is approximately 15 hours based on data from healthy \nsubjects. Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, approximately 88% of the \nradioactive dose is recovered in faeces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present \nin faeces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the \nadministered dose, respectively).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was examined in subjects with pre-existing mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in healthy control \nsubjects. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose increased by \napproximately 11% and 260% in subjects with mild and moderate pre-existing hepatic impairment, \nrespectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with \nmild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\n\n\n22\n\nIn another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with pre-existing \nsevere (n = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal \nhepatic function. The AUC to abiraterone increased by approximately 600% and the fraction of free \ndrug increased by 80% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal \nhepatic function.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment.\nThe use of abiraterone acetate should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nabiraterone acetate should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 \nand 4.4).\n\nFor patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, suspension of treatment and dose \nadjustment may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was compared in patients with end-stage renal disease on \na stable haemodialysis schedule versus matched control subjects with normal renal function. Systemic \nexposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage \nrenal disease on dialysis. Administration in patients with renal impairment, including severe renal \nimpairment, does not require dose reduction (see section 4.2). However, there is no clinical experience \nin patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is advised in these patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn all animal toxicity studies, circulating testosterone levels were significantly reduced. As a result, \nreduction in organ weights and morphological and/or histopathological changes in the reproductive \norgans, and the adrenal, pituitary and mammary glands were observed. All changes showed complete \nor partial reversibility. The changes in the reproductive organs and androgen-sensitive organs are \nconsistent with the pharmacology of abiraterone. All treatment-related hormonal changes reversed or \nwere shown to be resolving after a 4-week recovery period.\n\nIn fertility studies in both male and female rats, abiraterone acetate reduced fertility, which was \ncompletely reversible in 4 to 16 weeks after abiraterone acetate was stopped.\n\nIn a developmental toxicity study in the rat, abiraterone acetate affected pregnancy including reduced \nfoetal weight and survival. Effects on the external genitalia were observed though abiraterone acetate \nwas not teratogenic.\n\nIn these fertility and developmental toxicity studies performed in the rat, all effects were related to the \npharmacological activity of abiraterone.\n\nAside from reproductive organ changes seen in all animal toxicology studies, non-clinical data reveal \nno special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a \n6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in the rat, \nabiraterone acetate increased the incidence of interstitial cell neoplasms in the testes. This finding is \nconsidered related to the pharmacological action of abiraterone and rat specific. Abiraterone acetate \nwas not carcinogenic in female rats.\n\nThe active substance, abiraterone, shows an environmental risk for the aquatic environment, especially \nto fish.\n\n\n\n23\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZYTIGA 500 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 500 mg of abiraterone acetate.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach film-coated tablet contains 253.2 mg of lactose and 13.5 mg of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\nPurple, oval-shaped, film-coated tablets (20 mm long by 10 mm wide), debossed with \u201cAA\u201d on one \nside and \u201c500\u201d on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZYTIGA is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for:\n\uf0b7 the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer \n\n(mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see section \n5.1)\n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are \nasymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom \nchemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1)\n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a \ndocetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nThis medicinal product should be prescribed by an appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken \nwith food (see \u201cMethod of administration\u201d below). Taking the tablets with food increases systemic \nexposure to abiraterone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nDosage of prednisone or prednisolone\nFor mHSPC, ZYTIGA is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily. \n\nFor mCRPC, ZYTIGA is used with 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.\n\nMedical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be continued \nduring treatment in patients not surgically castrated.\n\nRecommended monitoring\nSerum transaminases should be measured prior to starting treatment, every two weeks for the first \nthree months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Blood pressure, serum potassium and fluid retention \nshould be monitored monthly. However, patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure \n\n\n\n26\n\nshould be monitored every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn patients with pre-existing hypokalaemia or those that develop hypokalaemia whilst being treated \nwith ZYTIGA, consider maintaining the patient\u2019s potassium level at \u2265 4.0 mM.\nFor patients who develop Grade \u2265 3 toxicities including hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and \nother non-mineralocorticoid toxicities, treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical \nmanagement should be instituted. Treatment with ZYTIGA should not be reinitiated until symptoms \nof the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.\nIn the event of a missed daily dose of either ZYTIGA, prednisone or prednisolone, treatment should be \nresumed the following day with the usual daily dose.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nFor patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increases \nor aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increases above 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), \ntreatment should be withheld immediately (see section 4.4). Re-treatment following return of liver \nfunction tests to the patient\u2019s baseline may be given at a reduced dose of 500 mg (one tablet) once \ndaily. For patients being re-treated, serum transaminases should be monitored at a minimum of every \ntwo weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of \n500 mg daily, treatment should be discontinued.\n\nIf patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, \ntreatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh \nClass A.\n\nModerate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure \nto abiraterone by approximately four-fold following single oral doses of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg \n(see section 5.2). There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone \nacetate when administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass B or C). No dose adjustment can be predicted. The use of ZYTIGA should be cautiously \nassessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh \nthe possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). ZYTIGA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). However, there \nis no clinical experience in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is \nadvised in these patients (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of ZYTIGA in the paediatric population.\n\nMethod of administration\nZYTIGA is for oral use.\nThe tablets should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours after eating. These should be \nswallowed whole with water.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n- Women who are or may potentially be pregnant (see section 4.6).\n- Severe hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh Class C (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2)].\n- ZYTIGA with prednisone or prednisolone is contraindicated in combination with Ra-223.\n\n\n\n27\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypertension, hypokalaemia, fluid retention and cardiac failure due to mineralocorticoid excess\nZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention (see section 4.8) as a \nconsequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition (see section 5.1). \nCo-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting\nin a reduction in incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Caution is required in treating \npatients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, \nhypokalaemia (e.g., those on cardiac glycosides), or fluid retention (e.g., those with heart failure, \nsevere or unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia and those \nwith severe renal impairment).\n\nZYTIGA should be used with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The Phase 3 \nstudies conducted with ZYTIGA excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically \nsignificant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the \npast 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III or IV \nheart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection \nfraction measurement of < 50%. In studies 3011 and 302, patients with atrial fibrillation, or other\ncardiac arrhythmia requiring medical therapy were excluded. Safety in patients with left ventricular \nejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (in study 301) or NYHA \nClass II to IV heart failure (in studies 3011 and 302) was not established (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nBefore treating patients with a significant risk for congestive heart failure (e.g.a history of cardiac \nfailure, uncontrolled hypertension, or cardiac events such as ischaemic heart disease), consider \nobtaining an assessment of cardiac function (e.g. echocardiogram). Before treatment with ZYTIGA, \ncardiac failure should be treated and cardiac function optimised. Hypertension, hypokalaemia and \nfluid retention should be corrected and controlled. During treatment, blood pressure, serum potassium, \nfluid retention (weight gain, peripheral oedema), and other signs and symptoms of congestive heart \nfailure should be monitored every 2 weeks for 3 months, then monthly thereafter and abnormalities \ncorrected. QT prolongation has been observed in patients experiencing hypokalaemia in association \nwith ZYTIGA treatment. Assess cardiac function as clinically indicated, institute appropriate \nmanagement and consider discontinuation of this treatment if there is a clinically significant decrease \nin cardiac function (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment\nMarked increases in liver enzymes leading to treatment discontinuation or dose modification occurred \nin controlled clinical studies (see section 4.8). Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to \nstarting treatment, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment, and monthly thereafter. If \nclinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop, serum transaminases should be \nmeasured immediately. If at any time the ALT or AST rises above 5 times the ULN, treatment should \nbe interrupted immediately and liver function closely monitored. Re-treatment may take place only \nafter return of liver function tests to the patient\u2019s baseline and at a reduced dose level (see section 4.2).\n\nIf patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, \ntreatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated.\n\nPatients with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis were excluded from clinical trials; thus, there are no \ndata to support the use of ZYTIGA in this population.\n\nThere are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate when \nadministered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). The \nuse of ZYTIGA should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom \nthe benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). ZYTIGA should not be \nused in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of acute liver failure and hepatitis fulminant, some with \nfatal outcome (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n28\n\nCorticosteroid withdrawal and coverage of stress situations\nCaution is advised and monitoring for adrenocortical insufficiency should occur if patients are \nwithdrawn from prednisone or prednisolone. If ZYTIGA is continued after corticosteroids are \nwithdrawn, patients should be monitored for symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess (see information \nabove).\n\nIn patients on prednisone or prednisolone who are subjected to unusual stress, an increased dose of \ncorticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after the stressful situation.\n\nBone density\nDecreased bone density may occur in men with metastatic advanced prostate cancer. The use of \nZYTIGA in combination with a glucocorticoid could increase this effect.\n\nPrior use of ketoconazole\nLower rates of response might be expected in patients previously treated with ketoconazole for \nprostate cancer.\n\nHyperglycaemia\nThe use of glucocorticoids could increase hyperglycaemia, therefore blood sugar should be measured \nfrequently in patients with diabetes.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nCases of hypoglycaemia have been reported when ZYTIGA plus prednisone/prednisolone was \nadministered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving pioglitazone or repaglinide (see section \n4.5); therefore, blood sugar should be monitored in patients with diabetes.\n\nUse with chemotherapy\nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant use of ZYTIGA with cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1).\n\nIntolerance to excipients\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. This medicinal product also contains more than 1.18 mmol (or 27 mg) sodium per dose of \ntwo tablets. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nPotential risks\nAnaemia and sexual dysfunction may occur in men with metastatic prostate cancer including those \nundergoing treatment with ZYTIGA.\n\nSkeletal muscle effects\nCases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated with ZYTIGA. Most \ncases developed within the first 6 months of treatment and recovered after ZYTIGA withdrawal. \nCaution is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products known to be \nassociated with myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nStrong inducers of CYP3A4 during treatment are to be avoided unless there is no therapeutic \nalternative, due to risk of decreased exposure to abiraterone (see section 4.5).\n\nCombination of abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone with Ra-223\nTreatment with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone in combination with Ra-223 is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3) due to an increased risk of fractures and a trend for increased \nmortality among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic prostate cancer patients as observed in clinical \ntrials.\n\n\n\n29\n\nIt is recommended that subsequent treatment with Ra-223 is not initiated for at least 5 days after the \nlast administration of ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone/prednisolone. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of food on abiraterone acetate\nAdministration with food significantly increases the absorption of abiraterone acetate. The efficacy \nand safety when given with food have not been established therefore this medicinal product must not \nbe taken with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect abiraterone exposures\nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 \ninducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, \nthe mean plasma AUC\u221e of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.\n\nStrong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, \nphenobarbital, St John\u2019s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) during treatment are to be avoided, unless \nthere is no therapeutic alternative.\n\nIn a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects, co-administration of \nketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the \npharmacokinetics of abiraterone.\n\nPotential to affect exposures to other medicinal products\nAbiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolising enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.\nIn a study to determine the effects of abiraterone acetate (plus prednisone) on a single dose of the \nCYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan, the systemic exposure (AUC) of dextromethorphan was \nincreased approximately 2.9 fold. The AUC24 for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of \ndextromethorphan, increased approximately 33%.\n\nCaution is advised when administering with medicinal products activated by or metabolised by \nCYP2D6, particularly with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index. Dose reduction of \nmedicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolised by CYP2D6 should be \nconsidered. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 include metoprolol, \npropranolol, desipramine, venlafaxine, haloperidol, risperidone, propafenone, flecainide, codeine, \noxycodone and tramadol (the latter three medicinal products requiring CYP2D6 to form their active \nanalgesic metabolites).\n\nIn a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone was increased by \n46% and the AUCs for M-III and M-IV, the active metabolites of pioglitazone, each decreased by 10% \nwhen pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Patients \nshould be monitored for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic \nindex if used concomitantly. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8 include \npioglitazone and repaglinide (see section 4.4).\n\nIn vitro, the major metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate were shown to \ninhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence it may increase the \nconcentrations of medicinal products eliminated by OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to \nconfirm transporter based interaction.\n\nUse with products known to prolong QT interval\nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, caution is advised when \nadministering ZYTIGA with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal \nproducts able to induce torsades de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III \n(e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, \nmoxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc.\n\n\n\n30\n\nUse with Spironolactone\nSpironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. \nUse with ZYTIGA is not recommended (see section 5.1).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nThere are no human data on the use of ZYTIGA in pregnancy and this medicinal product is not for use \nin women of childbearing potential.\n\nContraception in males and females\nIt is not known whether abiraterone or its metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required if \nthe patient is engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient is engaged in sex with a \nwoman of childbearing potential, a condom is required along with another effective contraceptive \nmethod. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nPregnancy\nZYTIGA is not for use in women and is contraindicated in women who are or may potentially be \npregnant (see section 4.3 and 5.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nZYTIGA is not for use in women.\n\nFertility\nAbiraterone affected fertility in male and female rats, but these effects were fully reversible (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZYTIGA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with ZYTIGA, adverse reactions that \nwere observed in \u226510% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension urinary tract \ninfection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased.\nOther important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic \nalveolitis.\n\nZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic \nconsequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse \nreactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients treated \nwith placebo: hypokalaemia 18% vs. 8%, hypertension 22% vs. 16% and fluid retention (peripheral \noedema) 23% vs. 17%, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate versus patients treated \nwith placebo: CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6% versus 1%, \nCTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 7% versus 5%, and fluid \nretention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1% versus 1% of patients, \nrespectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. \nConcomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nIn studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or \nwere previously treated with orchiectomy, ZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in \n\n\n\n31\n\ncombination with low dose prednisone or prednisolone (either 5 or 10 mg daily depending on the \nindication).\n\nAdverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed below by \nfrequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions identified in clinical studies and post-marketing\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction and frequency\nInfections and infestations very common: urinary tract infection\n\ncommon: sepsis\nImmune system disorders not known: anaphylactic reactions\nEndocrine disorders uncommon: adrenal insufficiency\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders very common: hypokalaemia\n\ncommon: hypertriglyceridaemia\nCardiac disorders common: cardiac failure*, angina pectoris, \n\natrial fibrillation, tachycardia\nuncommon: other arrhythmias\nnot known: myocardial infarction, \nQT prolongation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5)\n\nVascular disorders very common: hypertension\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nrare: allergic alveolitisa\n\nGastrointestinal disorders very common: diarrhoea\ncommon: dyspepsia\n\nHepatobiliary disorders very common: alanine aminotransferase\nincreased and/or aspartate aminotransferase \nincreased b\n\nrare: hepatitis fulminant, acute hepatic failure\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders common: rash\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders\n\nuncommon: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis\n\nRenal and urinary disorders common: haematuria\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions\n\nvery common: oedema peripheral\n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications\n\ncommon: fractures**\n\n* Cardiac failure also includes congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction decreased\n** Fractures includes osteoporosis and all fractures with the exception of pathological fractures\na Spontaneous reports from post-marketing experience\nb Alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased includes ALT increased, AST \n\nincreased, and hepatic function abnormal.\n\nThe following CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with \nabiraterone acetate: hypokalaemia 5%; urinary tract infection 2%; alanine aminotransferase increased\nand/or aspartate aminotransferase increased 4%; hypertension 6%; fractures 2%; peripheral oedema, \ncardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation 1% each. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia \nand angina pectoris occurred in < 1% of patients. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 4 urinary tract infection,\nalanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypokalemia, cardiac \nfailure, atrial fibrillation, and fractures occurred in < 1% of patients.\n\nA higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive \npopulation (study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive \npopulation (study 3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively. \n\n\n\n32\n\nHypokalemia was observed in 20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) \ncompared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 301 and 302, respectively).\n\nThe incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroup of patients with baseline \nECOG2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (\u226575 years ).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nCardiovascular reactions\nThe three Phase 3 studies excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant heart \ndisease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, \nsevere or unstable angina, or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to IV heart \nfailure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of < 50%. All patients enrolled \n(both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen deprivation \ntherapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with diabetes, \nmyocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of \ncardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus \npatients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, \nangina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nHepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with \nabiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST \nincreases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of \npatients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. \nIn Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with ZYTIGA. \nTen patients who received ZYTIGA were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; two had Grade 2 \nhepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. No patient died of \nhepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose baseline ALT or AST \nwere elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than those beginning with \nnormal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations in bilirubin \n> 3 x ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two instances marked \nincreases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with normal baseline \nhepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin elevations 2 to \n6 x ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their liver function \ntests and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, Grade 3 or 4 \nALT or AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone acetate. \nAminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver metastases and 1 \nwith AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate). In Phase 3 \nclinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic \nfunction were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% of patients treated \nwith placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.\n\nIn clinical trials, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline \nhepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 trial, patients with baseline \nALT and AST > 2.5 X ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 X ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral \nhepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were\nexcluded. In the 301 trial, patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver \nmetastases and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 trial, patients \nwith liver metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN were \nexcluded. Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical trials were \nvigorously managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return \nof liver function tests to the patient\u2019s baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or \nAST > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The \nmechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood.\n\n\n\n33\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of overdose with ZYTIGA is limited.\n\nThere is no specific antidote. In the event of an overdose, administration should be withheld and \ngeneral supportive measures undertaken, including monitoring for arrhythmias, hypokalaemia and for \nsigns and symptoms of fluid retention. Liver function also should be assessed.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: endocrine therapy, other hormone antagonists and related agents, ATC \ncode: L02BX03\n\nMechanism of action\nAbiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. \nSpecifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This \nenzyme is expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal and prostatic \ntumour tissues. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone \nprecursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the \nC17,20 bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals \n(see section 4.4).\n\nAndrogen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. \nAndrogen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with LHRH analogues or orchiectomy, decrease \nandrogen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the \ntumour. Treatment with ZYTIGA decreases serum testosterone to undetectable levels (using \ncommercial assays) when given with LHRH analogues (or orchiectomy).\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nZYTIGA decreases serum testosterone and other androgens to levels lower than those achieved by the \nuse of LHRH analogues alone or by orchiectomy. This results from the selective inhibition of the \nCYP17 enzyme required for androgen biosynthesis. PSA serves as a biomarker in patients with \nprostate cancer. In a Phase 3 clinical study of patients who failed prior chemotherapy with taxanes, \n38% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate, versus 10% of patients treated with placebo, had at \nleast a 50% decline from baseline in PSA levels.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nEfficacy was established in three randomised placebo-controlled multicentre Phase 3 clinical studies \n(studies 3011, 302 and 301) of patients with mHSPC and mCRPC. Study 3011 enrolled patients who \nwere newly diagnosed (within 3 months of randomization) mHSPC who had high-risk prognostic \nfactors. High-risk prognosis was defined as having at least 2 of the following 3 risk factors: (1) \nGleason score of \u22658; (2) presence of 3 or more lesions on bone scan; (3) presence of measurable \nvisceral (excluding lymph node disease) metastasis. In the active arm, ZYTIGA was administered at a \ndose of 1000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone 5 mg once daily in addition to ADT \n(LHRH agonist or orchiectomy), which was the standard of care treatment. Patients in the control arm \nreceived ADT and placebos for both ZYTIGA and prednisone. Study 302 enrolled docetaxel na\u00efve \npatients; whereas, study 301 enrolled patients who had received prior docetaxel. Patients were using \nan LHRH analogue or were previously treated with orchiectomy. In the active treatment arm, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n34\n\nZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Control patients received placebo and low dose prednisone or \nprednisolone 5 mg twice daily.\n\nChanges in PSA serum concentration independently do not always predict clinical benefit. Therefore, \nin all studies it was recommended that patients be maintained on their study treatments until \ndiscontinuation criteria were met as specified below for each study.\n\nIn all studies spironolactone use was not allowed as spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and \nmay increase PSA levels.\n\nStudy 3011 (patients with newly diagnosed high risk mHSPC)\nIn Study 3011, (n=1199) the median age of enrolled patients was 67 years. The number of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA by racial group was Caucasian 832 (69.4%), Asian 246 (20.5%), Black or \nAfrican American 25 (2.1%), other 80 (6.7%), unknown/not reported 13 (1.1%), and American Indian \nor Alaska Native 3 (0.3%). The ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 for 97% of patients. Patients \nwith known brain metastasis, uncontrolled hypertension, significant heart disease, or NYHA Class II-\nIV heart failure were excluded. Patients that were treated with prior pharmacotherapy, radiation \ntherapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer were excluded with the exception of up to 3 months \nof ADT or 1 course of palliative radiation or surgical therapy to treat symptoms resulting from \nmetastatic disease. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic \nprogression-free survival (rPFS). The median baseline pain score, as measured by the Brief Pain \nInventory Short Form (BPI-SF) was 2.0 in both the treatment and Placebo groups. In addition to the \nco-primary endpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to skeletal-related event (SRE), \ntime to subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to pain \nprogression, and time to PSA progression. Treatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal \nof consent, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or death.\n\nRadiographic progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence \nof radiographic progression or death from any cause. Radiographic progression included progression \nby bone scan (according to modified PCWG2) or progression of soft tissue lesions by CT or MRI \n(according to RECIST 1.1).\n\nA significant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 2 and Figure 1).\n\nTable 2: Radiographic Progression-Free Survival - Stratified Analysis; Intent-to-treat Population \n(Study PCR3011)\n\nAA-P Placebo\nSubjects randomised 597 602\n\nEvent 239 (40.0%) 354 (58.8%)\nCensored 358 (60.0%) 248 (41.2%)\n\nTime to Event (months)\nMedian (95% CI) 33.02 (29.57, NE) 14.78 (14.69, 18.27)\nRange (0.0+, 41.0+) (0.0+, 40.6+)\n\np valuea < 0.0001\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.466 (0.394, 0.550)\n\nNote: += censored observation, NE=not estimable.

The treatment effect of AA-P on rPFS \nand OS across the pre-specified subgroups was favorable and consistent with the overall study \npopulation, except for the subgroup of ECOG score of 2 where no trend towards benefit was observed, \nhowever the small sample size (n=40) limits drawing any meaningful conclusion.\n\nIn addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for \nZYTIGA vs. placebo treatment in all prospectively-defined secondary endpoints.\n\nStudy 302 (chemotherapy na\u00efve patients)\nThis study enrolled chemotherapy na\u00efve patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and \nfor whom chemotherapy was not yet clinically indicated. A score of 0-1 on Brief Pain Inventory-Short \nForm (BPI-SF) worst pain in last 24 hours was considered asymptomatic, and a score of 2-3 was \nconsidered mildly symptomatic.\n\nIn study 302, (n = 1,088) the median age of enrolled patients was 71 years for patients treated with \nZYTIGA plus prednisone or prednisolone and 70 years for patients treated with placebo plus \nprednisone or prednisolone. The number of patients treated with ZYTIGA by racial group was \nCaucasian 520 (95.4%), Black 15 (2.8%), Asian 4 (0.7%) and other 6 (1.1%). The Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of patients in \nboth arms. Fifty percent of patients had only bone metastases, an additional 31% of patients had bone \nand soft tissue or lymph node metastases and 19% of patients had only soft tissue or lymph node \nmetastases. Patients with visceral metastases were excluded. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were \noverall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). In addition to the co-primary \nendpoint measures, benefit was also assessed using time to opiate use for cancer pain, time to initiation \nof cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to deterioration in ECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point and time to \nPSA progression based on Prostate Cancer Working Group-2 (PCWG2) criteria. Study treatments \nwere discontinued at the time of unequivocal clinical progression. Treatments could also be \ndiscontinued at the time of confirmed radiographic progression at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nRadiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies \nas defined by PCWG2 criteria (for bone lesions) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid \n\n\n\n37\n\nTumors (RECIST) criteria (for soft tissue lesions). Analysis of rPFS utilised centrally-reviewed \nradiographic assessment of progression.\n\nAt the planned rPFS analysis there were 401 events, 150 (28%) of patients treated with ZYTIGA and \n251 (46%) of patients treated with placebo had radiographic evidence of progression or had died. A \nsignificant difference in rPFS between treatment groups was observed (see Table 4 and Figure 3).\n\nTable 4: Study 302: Radiographic progression-free survival of patients treated with either \nZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH \nanalogues or prior orchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 546)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 542)\n\nRadiographic \nProgression-free Survival \n\n(rPFS)\nProgression or death 150 (28%) 251 (46%)\n\nMedian rPFS in months\n(95% CI)\n\nNot reached\n(11.66; NE)\n\n8.3\n(8.12; 8.54)\n\np-value* < 0.0001\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.425 (0.347; 0.522)\n\nNE = Not estimated\n* p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by baseline ECOG score (0 or 1)\n** Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\nFigure 3: Kaplan Meier curves of radiographic progression-free survival in patients treated \nwith either ZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone \nplus LHRH analogues or prior orchiectomy\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\nHowever, subject data continued to be collected through the date of the second interim analysis of \nOverall survival (OS). The investigator radiographic review of rPFS performed as a follow up \nsensitivity analysis is presented in Table 5 and Figure 4.\n\nSix hundred and seven (607) subjects had radiographic progression or died: 271 (50%) in the \nabiraterone acetate group and 336 (62%) in the placebo group.

The median rPFS was 16.5 months in the \nabiraterone acetate group and 8.3 months in the placebo group.\n\nTable 5: Study 302: Radiographic progression-free survival of patients treated with either \nZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH \nanalogues or prior orchiectomy (At second interim analysis of OS-Investigator \nReview)\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 546)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 542)\n\nRadiographic \nProgression-free Survival \n\n(rPFS)\nProgression or death 271 (50%) 336 (62%)\n\nMedian rPFS in months\n(95% CI)\n\n16.5\n(13.80; 16.79)\n\n8.3\n(8.05; 9.43)\n\np-value* < 0.0001\nHazard ratio**\n\n(95% CI)\n0.530 (0.451; 0.623)\n\n* p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by baseline ECOG score (0 or 1)\n** Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\nFigure 4: Kaplan Meier curves of radiographic progression-free survival in patients treated \nwith either ZYTIGA or placebo in combination with prednisone or prednisolone \nplus LHRH analogues or prior orchiectomy (At second interim analysis of \nOS-Investigator Review)\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\nA planned interim analysis (IA) for OS was conducted after 333 deaths were observed. The study was \nunblinded based on the magnitude of clinical benefit observed and patients in the placebo group were \noffered treatment with ZYTIGA. Overall survival was longer for ZYTIGA than placebo with a 25%\nreduction in risk of death (HR = 0.752; 95% CI: [0.606; 0.934], p = 0.0097), but OS was not mature \n\n\n\n39\n\nand interim results did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for statistical significance (see \nTable 4). Survival continued to be followed after this IA.\n\nThe planned final analysis for OS was conducted after 741 deaths were observed (median follow up of \n49 months). Sixty-five percent (354 of 546) of patients treated with ZYTIGA, compared with 71% \n(387 of 542) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A statistically significant OS benefit in favour \nof the ZYTIGA-treated group was demonstrated with a 19.4% reduction in risk of death \n(HR = 0.806; 95% CI: [0.697; 0.931], p = 0.0033) and an improvement in median OS of 4.4 months \n(ZYTIGA 34.7 months, placebo 30.3 months) (see Table 6 and Figure 5). This improvement was \ndemonstrated even though 44% of patients in the placebo arm received ZYTIGA as subsequent \ntherapy.\n\nTable 6: Study 302: Overall survival of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in\ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 546)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 542)\n\nInterim survival analysis\nDeaths (%) 147 (27%) 186 (34%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\nNot reached\n(NE; NE)\n\n27.2\n(25.95; NE)\n\np-value* 0.0097\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.752 (0.606; 0.934)\nFinal survival analysis\n\nDeaths 354 (65%) 387 (71%)\nMedian overall survival in \n\nmonths (95% CI)\n34.7 (32.7; 36.8) 30.3 (28.7; 33.3)\n\np-value* 0.0033\nHazard ratio** (95% CI) 0.806 (0.697; 0.931)\n\nNE = Not Estimated\n* p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by baseline ECOG score (0 or 1)\n** Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n40\n\nFigure 5: Kaplan Meier survival curves of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy, final analysis\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\nIn addition to the observed improvements in overall survival and rPFS, benefit was demonstrated for \nZYTIGA vs. placebo treatment in all secondary endpoint measures as follows:\n\nTime to PSA progression based on PCWG2 criteria: The median time to PSA progression was \n11.1 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and 5.6 months for patients receiving placebo \n(HR = 0.488; 95% CI: [0.420; 0.568], p < 0.0001). The time to PSA progression was approximately \ndoubled with ZYTIGA treatment (HR = 0.488). The proportion of subjects with a confirmed PSA \nresponse was greater in the ZYTIGA group than in the placebo group (62% vs. 24%; p < 0.0001). In \nsubjects with measurable soft tissue disease, significantly increased numbers of complete and partial \ntumor responses were seen with ZYTIGA treatment.\n\nTime to opiate use for cancer pain: The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain at the time \nof final analysis was 33.4 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and was 23.4 months for patients \nreceiving placebo (HR = 0.721; 95% CI: [0.614; 0.846], p < 0.0001).\n\nTime to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy: The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy \nwas 25.2 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and 16.8 months for patients receiving placebo \n(HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.487; 0.691], p < 0.0001).\n\nTime to deterioration in ECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point: The median time to deterioration in \nECOG performance score by \u2265 1 point was 12.3 months for patients receiving ZYTIGA and \n10.9 months for patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.821; 95% CI: [0.714; 0.943], p = 0.0053).\n\nThe following study endpoints demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in favour of ZYTIGA \ntreatment:\n\n\n\n41\n\nObjective response: Objective response was defined as the proportion of subjects with measurable \ndisease achieving a complete or partial response according to RECIST criteria (baseline lymph node \nsize was required to be \u2265 2 cm to be considered a target lesion). The proportion of subjects with \nmeasurable disease at baseline who had an objective response was 36% in the ZYTIGA group and \n16% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).\n\nPain: Treatment with ZYTIGA significantly reduced the risk of average pain intensity progression by \n18% compared with placebo (p = 0.0490). The median time to progression was 26.7 months in the \nZYTIGA group and 18.4 months in the placebo group.\n\nTime to degradation in the FACT-P (Total Score): Treatment with ZYTIGA decreased the risk of \nFACT-P (Total Score) degradation by 22% compared with placebo (p = 0.0028). The median time to \ndegradation in FACT-P (Total Score) was 12.7 months in the ZYTIGA group and 8.3 months in the \nplacebo group.\n\nStudy 301 (patients who had received prior chemotherapy)\nStudy 301 enrolled patients who had received prior docetaxel. Patients were not required to show \ndisease progression on docetaxel, as toxicity from this chemotherapy may have led to discontinuation.\nPatients were maintained on study treatments until there was PSA progression (confirmed 25% \nincrease over the patient\u2019s baseline/nadir) together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and \nsymptomatic or clinical progression. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer \nwere excluded from this study. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.\n\nThe median age of enrolled patients was 69 years (range 39-95). The number of patients treated with \nZYTIGA by racial group was Caucasian 737 (93.2%), Black 28 (3.5%), Asian 11 (1.4%) and other 14 \n(1.8%). Eleven percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance score of 2; 70% had \nradiographic evidence of disease progression with or without PSA progression; 70% had received one \nprior cytotoxic chemotherapy and 30% received two. Liver metastasis was present in 11% of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA.\n\nIn a planned analysis conducted after 552 deaths were observed, 42% (333 of 797) of patients treated \nwith ZYTIGA compared with 55% (219 of 398) of patients treated with placebo, had died. A \nstatistically significant improvement in median overall survival was seen in patients treated with \nZYTIGA (see Table 7).\n\nTable 7: Overall survival of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nZYTIGA\n(N = 797)\n\nPlacebo\n(N = 398)\n\nPrimary Survival Analysis\nDeaths (%) 333 (42%) 219 (55%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\n14.8 (14.1; 15.4) 10.9 (10.2; 12.0)\n\np-valuea < 0.0001\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.646 (0.543; 0.768)\n\nUpdated Survival Analysis\nDeaths (%) 501 (63%) 274 (69%)\n\nMedian survival (months)\n(95% CI)\n\n15.8 (14.8; 17.0) 11.2 (10.4; 13.1)\n\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b 0.740 (0.638; 0.859)\na p-value is derived from a log-rank test stratified by ECOG performance status score (0-1 vs. 2), pain score (absent vs. \n\npresent), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. 2), and type of disease progression (PSA only vs. \nradiographic).\n\nb Hazard ratio is derived from a stratified proportional hazards model. Hazard ratio < 1 favours ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n42\n\nAt all evaluation time points after the initial few months of treatment, a higher proportion of patients \ntreated with ZYTIGA remained alive, compared with the proportion of patients treated with placebo\n(see Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Kaplan Meier survival curves of patients treated with either ZYTIGA or placebo in \ncombination with prednisone or prednisolone plus LHRH analogues or prior \norchiectomy\n\nAA = ZYTIGA\n\n\n\n43\n\nSubgroup survival analyses showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment with ZYTIGA (see \nFigure 7).\n\nFigure 7: Overall survival by subgroup: hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval\n\nAA = ZYTIGA; BPI = Brief Pain Inventory; C.I. = confidence interval; ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \nperformance score; HR = hazard ratio; NE = not evaluable\n\nIn addition to the observed improvement in overall survival, all secondary study endpoints favoured \nZYTIGA and were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing as follows:\n\nPatients receiving ZYTIGA demonstrated a significantly higher total PSA response rate (defined as a \n\u2265 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 38% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001.\n\nThe median time to PSA progression was 10.2 months for patients treated with ZYTIGA and \n6.6 months for patients treated with placebo (HR = 0.580; 95% CI: [0.462; 0.728], p < 0.0001).\n\nThe median radiographic progression-free survival was 5.6 months for patients treated with ZYTIGA \nand 3.6 months for patients who received placebo (HR = 0.673; 95% CI: [0.585; 0.776], p < 0.0001).\n\nPain\nThe proportion of patients with pain palliation was statistically significantly higher in the ZYTIGA \ngroup than in the placebo group (44% vs. 27%, p = 0.0002). A responder for pain palliation was \ndefined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain \nintensity score over the last 24 hours without any increase in analgesic usage score observed at \ntwo consecutive evaluations four weeks apart. Only patients with a baseline pain score of \u2265 4 and at \nleast one post-baseline pain score were analysed (N = 512) for pain palliation.\n\nA lower proportion of patients treated with ZYTIGA had pain progression compared to patients taking \nplacebo at 6 (22% vs. 28%), 12 (30% vs. 38%) and 18 months (35% vs. 46%). Pain progression was \ndefined as an increase from baseline of \u2265 30% in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity score over the \nprevious 24 hours without a decrease in analgesic usage score observed at two consecutive visits, or an \nincrease of \u2265 30% in analgesic usage score observed at two consecutive visits. The time to pain \nprogression at the 25th percentile was 7.4 months in the ZYTIGA group, versus 4.7 months in the \nplacebo group.\n\n\n\n44\n\nSkeletal-related events\nA lower proportion of patients in the ZYTIGA group had skeletal-related events compared with the \nplacebo group at 6 months (18% vs. 28%), 12 months (30% vs. 40%), and 18 months (35% vs. 40%). \nThe time to first skeletal-related event at the 25th percentile in the ZYTIGA group was twice that of the \ncontrol group at 9.9 months versus 4.9 months. A skeletal-related event was defined as a pathological \nfracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZYTIGA in all subsets of the paediatric population in advanced prostate cancer. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nFollowing administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone and abiraterone \nacetate have been studied in healthy subjects, patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer and \nsubjects without cancer with hepatic or renal impairment. Abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted in \nvivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor (see section 5.1).\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of abiraterone acetate in the fasting state, the time to reach maximum \nplasma abiraterone concentration is approximately 2 hours.\n\nAdministration of abiraterone acetate with food, compared with administration in a fasted state, results \nin up to a 10-fold (AUC) and up to a 17-fold (Cmax) increase in mean systemic exposure of abiraterone, \ndepending on the fat content of the meal. Given the normal variation in the content and composition of \nmeals, taking ZYTIGA with meals has the potential to result in highly variable exposures. Therefore, \nZYTIGA must not be taken with food. It should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours \nafter eating. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nThe plasma protein binding of 14C-abiraterone in human plasma is 99.8%. The apparent volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,630 l, suggesting that abiraterone extensively distributes to peripheral \ntissues.\n\nBiotransformation\nFollowing oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolysed \nto abiraterone, which then undergoes metabolism including sulphation, hydroxylation and oxidation \nprimarily in the liver. The majority of circulating radioactivity (approximately 92%) is found in the \nform of metabolites of abiraterone. Of 15 detectable metabolites, 2 main metabolites, abiraterone \nsulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate, each represents approximately 43% of total radioactivity.\n\nElimination\nThe mean half-life of abiraterone in plasma is approximately 15 hours based on data from healthy \nsubjects. Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, approximately 88% of the \nradioactive dose is recovered in faeces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present \nin faeces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the \nadministered dose, respectively).\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was examined in subjects with pre-existing mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in healthy control \nsubjects. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose increased by \napproximately 11% and 260% in subjects with mild and moderate pre-existing hepatic impairment, \nrespectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with \nmild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\n\n\n45\n\nIn another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with pre-existing \nsevere (n = 8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal \nhepatic function. The AUC to abiraterone increased by approximately 600% and the fraction of free \ndrug increased by 80% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal \nhepatic function.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment.\nThe use of abiraterone acetate should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment in whom the benefit clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nabiraterone acetate should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 \nand 4.4).\n\nFor patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, suspension of treatment and dose \nadjustment may be required (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was compared in patients with end-stage renal disease on \na stable haemodialysis schedule versus matched control subjects with normal renal function. Systemic \nexposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage \nrenal disease on dialysis. Administration in patients with renal impairment, including severe renal \nimpairment, does not require dose reduction (see section 4.2). However, there is no clinical experience \nin patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is advised in these patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn all animal toxicity studies, circulating testosterone levels were significantly reduced. As a result, \nreduction in organ weights and morphological and/or histopathological changes in the reproductive \norgans, and the adrenal, pituitary and mammary glands were observed. All changes showed complete \nor partial reversibility. The changes in the reproductive organs and androgen-sensitive organs are \nconsistent with the pharmacology of abiraterone. All treatment-related hormonal changes reversed or \nwere shown to be resolving after a 4-week recovery period.\n\nIn fertility studies in both male and female rats, abiraterone acetate reduced fertility, which was \ncompletely reversible in 4 to 16 weeks after abiraterone acetate was stopped.\n\nIn a developmental toxicity study in the rat, abiraterone acetate affected pregnancy including reduced \nfoetal weight and survival. Effects on the external genitalia were observed though abiraterone acetate \nwas not teratogenic.\n\nIn these fertility and developmental toxicity studies performed in the rat, all effects were related to the \npharmacological activity of abiraterone.\n\nAside from reproductive organ changes seen in all animal toxicology studies, non-clinical data reveal \nno special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a \n6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in the rat, \nabiraterone acetate increased the incidence of interstitial cell neoplasms in the testes. This finding is \nconsidered related to the pharmacological action of abiraterone and rat specific. Abiraterone acetate \nwas not carcinogenic in female rats.\n\nThe active substance, abiraterone, shows an environmental risk for the aquatic environment, especially \nto fish.\n\n\n\n46\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n64\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nZYTIGA 250 mg tablets\nabiraterone acetate\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What ZYTIGA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take ZYTIGA\n3. How to take ZYTIGA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store ZYTIGA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ZYTIGA is and what it is used for\n\nZYTIGA contains a medicine called abiraterone acetate. It is used to treat prostate cancer in adult men \nthat has spread to other parts of the body. ZYTIGA stops your body from making testosterone; this can \nslow the growth of prostate cancer.\n\nWhen ZYTIGA is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to hormone \ntherapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy). \n\nWhen you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or \nprednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in \nyour body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take ZYTIGA\n\nDo not take ZYTIGA\n- if you are allergic to abiraterone acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).\n- if you are a woman, especially if pregnant. ZYTIGA is for use in male patients only.\n- if you have severe liver damage.\n- in combination with Ra-223 (which is used to treat prostate cancer).\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:\n- if you have liver problems\n- if you have been told you have high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low \n\nblood potassium may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems)\n- if you have had other heart or blood vessel problems\n- if you have an irregular or rapid heart rate\n- if you have shortness of breath\n\n\n\n65\n\n- if you have gained weight rapidly\n- if you have swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs\n- if you have taken a medicine known as ketoconazole in the past for prostate cancer\n- about the need to take this medicine with prednisone or prednisolone\n- about possible effects on your bones\n- if you have high blood sugar.\n\nTell your doctor if you have been told you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart \nrhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions.\n\nTell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or \nvomiting, as these could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. Rarely, failure of the liver to \nfunction (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death.\n\nDecrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may\noccur.\n\nZYTIGA must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the risk of bone \nfracture or death. \n\nIf you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with ZYTIGA and prednisone/prednisolone, you must\nwait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nBlood monitoring\nZYTIGA may affect your liver, and you may not have any symptoms. When you are taking this \nmedicine, your doctor will check your blood periodically to look for any effects on your liver.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. If ZYTIGA is accidentally ingested by a child \nor adolescent, go to the hospital immediately and take the package leaflet with you to show to the \nemergency doctor.\n\nOther medicines and ZYTIGA\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is important because ZYTIGA may increase the effects of a number of medicines \nincluding heart medicines, tranquilisers, some medicines for diabetes, herbal medicines (e.g., \nSt John\u2019s wort) and others. Your doctor may want to change the dose of these medicines. Also, some \nmedicines may increase or decrease the effects of ZYTIGA. This may lead to side effects or to \nZYTIGA not working as well as it should.\n\nAndrogen deprivation treatment may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor if \nyou are receiving medicine\n- used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);\n- known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems [e.g. methadone (used for pain relief and \n\npart of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for \nserious mental illnesses)].\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.\n\nZYTIGA with food\n- This medicine must not be taken with food (see section 3, \u201cTaking this medicine\u201d).\n- Taking ZYTIGA with food may cause side effects.\n\n\n\n66\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nZYTIGA is not for use in women.\n- This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child if it is taken by women who are \n\npregnant.\n- Women who are pregnant or who may be pregnant should wear gloves if they need to \n\ntouch or handle ZYTIGA.\n- If you are having sex with a woman who can become pregnant, use a condom and another \n\neffective birth control method.\n- If you are having sex with a pregnant woman, use a condom to protect the unborn child.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine is not likely to affect your being able to drive and use any tools or machines.\n\nZYTIGA contains lactose and sodium\n- ZYTIGA contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have \n\nan intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n- This medicine also contains approximately 27 mg of sodium in a four tablet daily dose. To be \n\ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n3. How to take ZYTIGA\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\nThe recommended dose is 1,000 mg (four tablets) once a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n- Take this medicine by mouth.\n- Do not take ZYTIGA with food.\n- Take ZYTIGA at least one hour before or at least two hours after eating (see section 2, \n\n\u201cZYTIGA with food\u201d).\n- Swallow the tablets whole with water.\n- Do not break the tablets.\n- ZYTIGA is taken with a medicine called prednisone or prednisolone. Take the prednisone or \n\nprednisolone exactly as your doctor has told you.\n- You need to take prednisone or prednisolone every day while you are taking ZYTIGA.\n- The amount of prednisone or prednisolone you take may need to change if you have a medical \n\nemergency. Your doctor will tell you if you need to change the amount of prednisone or \nprednisolone you take. Do not stop taking prednisone or prednisolone unless your doctor tells \nyou to.\n\nYour doctor may also prescribe other medicines while you are taking ZYTIGA and prednisone or \nprednisolone.\n\nIf you take more ZYTIGA than you should\nIf you take more than you should, talk to your doctor or go to a hospital immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take ZYTIGA\n- If you forget to take ZYTIGA or prednisone or prednisolone, take your usual dose the following \n\nday.\n- If you forget to take ZYTIGA or prednisone or prednisolone for more than one day, talk to your \n\ndoctor without delay.\n\n\n\n67\n\nIf you stop taking ZYTIGA\nDo not stop taking ZYTIGA or prednisone or prednisolone unless your doctor tells you to.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nStop taking ZYTIGA and see a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following:\n- Muscle weakness, muscle twitches or a pounding heart beat (palpitations). These may be signs \n\nthat the level of potassium in your blood is low.\n\nOther side effects include:\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\nFluid in your legs or feet, low blood potassium, liver function test increases, high blood pressure, \nurinary tract infection, diarrhoea.\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\nHigh fat levels in your blood, chest pain, irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), heart failure, rapid \nheart rate, severe infections called sepsis, bone fractures, indigestion, blood in urine, rash.\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\nAdrenal gland problems (related to salt and water problems), abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), \nmuscle weakness and/or muscle pain\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\nLung irritation (also called allergic alveolitis).\nFailure of the liver to function (also called acute liver failure).\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):\nHeart attack, changes in ECG - electrocardiogram (QT prolongation), and serious allergic reactions \nwith difficulty swallowing or breathing, swollen face, lips, tongue or throat, or an itchy rash.\n\nBone loss may occur in men treated for prostate cancer. ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone or \nprednisolone may increase bone loss.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system\nlisted in Appendix V.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What ZYTIGA is and what it is used for\n\nZYTIGA contains a medicine called abiraterone acetate. It is used to treat prostate cancer in adult men \nthat has spread to other parts of the body. ZYTIGA stops your body from making testosterone; this can \nslow the growth of prostate cancer.\n\nWhen ZYTIGA is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to hormone \ntherapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy ).\n\nWhen you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or \nprednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in \nyour body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take ZYTIGA\n\nDo not take ZYTIGA\n- if you are allergic to abiraterone acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).\n- if you are a woman, especially if pregnant. ZYTIGA is for use in male patients only.\n- if you have severe liver damage.\n- in combination with Ra-223 (which is used to treat prostate cancer).\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking this medicine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:\n- if you have liver problems\n- if you have been told you have high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low \n\nblood potassium may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems)\n- if you have had other heart or blood vessel problems\n- if you have an irregular or rapid heart rate\n\n\n\n71\n\n- if you have shortness of breath\n- if you have gained weight rapidly\n- if you have swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs\n- if you have taken a medicine known as ketoconazole in the past for prostate cancer\n- about the need to take this medicine with prednisone or prednisolone\n- about possible effects on your bones\n- if you have high blood sugar.\n\nTell your doctor if you have been told you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart \nrhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions.\n\nTell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or \nvomiting, as these could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. Rarely, failure of the liver to \nfunction (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death.\n\nDecrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may \noccur.\n\nZYTIGA must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the risk of bone \nfracture or death. \n\nIf you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with ZYTIGA and prednisone/prednisolone, you must \nwait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this \nmedicine.\n\nBlood monitoring\nZYTIGA may affect your liver, and you may not have any symptoms. When you are taking this \nmedicine, your doctor will check your blood periodically to look for any effects on your liver.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents.

This is important because ZYTIGA may increase the effects of a number of medicines \nincluding heart medicines, tranquilisers, some medicines for diabetes, herbal medicines (e.g., \nSt John\u2019s wort) and others. Your doctor may want to change the dose of these medicines. Also, some \nmedicines may increase or decrease the effects of ZYTIGA. This may lead to side effects or to \nZYTIGA not working as well as it should.\n\nAndrogen deprivation treatment may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor if \nyou are receiving medicine\n- used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);\n- known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems [e.g. methadone (used for pain relief and \n\npart of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for \nserious mental illnesses)].\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.\n\nZYTIGA with food\n- This medicine must not be taken with food (see section 3, \u201cTaking this medicine\u201d).\n\n\n\n72\n\n- Taking ZYTIGA with food may cause side effects.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nZYTIGA is not for use in women.\n- This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child if it is taken by women who are \n\npregnant.\n- If you are having sex with a woman who can become pregnant, use a condom and another \n\neffective birth control method.\n- If you are having sex with a pregnant woman, use a condom to protect the unborn child.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine is not likely to affect your being able to drive and use any tools or machines.\n\nZYTIGA contains lactose and sodium\n- ZYTIGA contains lactose (a type of sugar).
