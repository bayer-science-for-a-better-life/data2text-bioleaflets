CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLeflunomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \n\n active rheumatoid arthritis as a \"disease-modifying antirheumatic drug\" (DMARD), \n active psoriatic arthritis. \n\n \nRecent or concurrent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) may \nresult in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions; therefore, the initiation of leflunomide \ntreatment has to be carefully considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects. \n \nMoreover, switching from leflunomide to another DMARD without following the washout procedure \n(see section 4.4) may also increase the risk of serious adverse reactions even for a long time after the \nswitching. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialists experienced in the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum glutamopyruvate transferase (SGPT) and a complete blood \ncell count, including a differential white blood cell count and a platelet count, must be checked \nsimultaneously and with the same frequency: \n\n before initiation of leflunomide, \n every two weeks during the first six months of treatment, and \n every 8 weeks thereafter (see section 4.4). \n\n \nPosology \n \n In rheumatoid arthritis: leflunomide therapy is usually started with a loading dose of 100 mg \n\nonce daily for 3 days. Omission of the loading dose may decrease the risk of adverse events (see \nsection 5.1). \nThe recommended maintenance dose is leflunomide 10 mg to 20 mg once daily depending on \nthe severity (activity) of the disease. \n\n In psoriatic arthritis: leflunomide therapy is started with a loading dose of 100 mg once daily for \n3 days. \nThe recommended maintenance dose is leflunomide 20 mg once daily (see section 5.1). \n\n \nThe therapeutic effect usually starts after 4 to 6 weeks and may further improve up to 4 to 6 months. \n \nThere is no dose adjustment recommended in patients with mild renal insufficiency. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \nRepso is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years since efficacy and safety in juvenile \nrheumatoid arthritis (JRA) have not been established (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRepso tablets are tablets for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with sufficient amounts \nof liquid. The extent of leflunomide absorption is not affected if it is taken with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity (especially previous Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, \n\nerythema multiforme) to the active substance, to the principal active metabolite teriflunomide or \nto any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n Patients with impairment of liver function.  \n \n Patients with severe immunodeficiency states, e.g. AIDS.  \n \n Patients with significantly impaired bone marrow function or significant anaemia, leucopenia, \n\nneutropenia or thrombocytopenia due to causes other than rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis.  \n \n Patients with serious infections (see section 4.4).  \n \n Patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, because insufficient clinical experience is \n\navailable in this patient group.  \n \n Patients with severe hypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome.  \n \n Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception \n\nduring treatment with leflunomide and thereafter as long as the plasma levels of the active \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nmetabolite are above 0.02 mg/l (see section 4.6). Pregnancy must be excluded before start of \ntreatment with leflunomide.  \n\n \n Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConcomitant administration of hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) is not \nadvisable. \n \nThe active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, has a long half-life, usually 1 to 4 weeks. Serious \nundesirable effects might occur (e.g. hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity or allergic reactions, see below), \neven if the treatment with leflunomide has been stopped. Therefore, when such toxicities occur or if \nfor any other reason A771726 needs to be cleared rapidly from the body, the washout procedure has to \nbe followed. The procedure may be repeated as clinically necessary. \n \nFor washout procedures and other recommended actions in case of desired or unintended pregnancy \nsee section 4.6. \n \nLiver reactions \n \nRare cases of severe liver injury, including cases with fatal outcome, have been reported during \ntreatment with leflunomide. Most of the cases occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. \nCo-treatment with other hepatotoxic medicinal products was frequently present. It is considered \nessential that monitoring recommendations are strictly adhered to. \n \nALT (SGPT) must be checked before initiation of leflunomide and at the same frequency as the \ncomplete blood cell count (every two weeks) during the first six months of treatment and every \n8 weeks thereafter. \n \nFor ALT (SGPT) elevations between 2- and 3-fold the upper limit of normal, dose reduction from \n20 mg to 10 mg may be considered and monitoring must be performed weekly. If ALT (SGPT) \nelevations of more than 2-fold the upper limit of normal persist or if ALT elevations of more than \n3-fold the upper limit of normal are present, leflunomide must be discontinued and wash-out \nprocedures initiated. It is recommended that monitoring of liver enzymes be maintained after \ndiscontinuation of leflunomide treatment, until liver enzyme levels have normalised. \n \nDue to a potential for additive hepatotoxic effects, it is recommended that alcohol consumption be \navoided during treatment with leflunomide. \n \nSince the active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, is highly protein bound and cleared via hepatic \nmetabolism and biliary secretion, plasma levels of A771726 are expected to be increased in patients \nwith hypoproteinaemia. Repso is contraindicated in patients with severe hypoproteinaemia or \nimpairment of liver function (see section 4.3). \n \nColitis \n \nColitis, including microscopic colitis has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide. In \npatients on leflunomide treatment presenting unexplained chronic diarrhoea appropriate diagnostic \nprocedures should be performed. \n \nHaematological reactions \n \nTogether with ALT, a complete blood cell count, including differential white blood cell count and \nplatelets, must be performed before start of leflunomide treatment as well as every 2 weeks for the first \n6 months of treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn patients with pre-existing anaemia, leucopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia as well as in patients with \nimpaired bone marrow function or those at risk of bone marrow suppression, the risk of \nhaematological disorders is increased. If such effects occur, a washout (see below) to reduce plasma \nlevels of A771726 should be considered. \n \nIn case of severe haematological reactions, including pancytopenia, Repso and any concomitant \nmyelosuppressive treatment must be discontinued and a leflunomide washout procedure initiated. \n \nCombinations with other treatments \n \nThe use of leflunomide with antimalarials used in rheumatic diseases (e.g. chloroquine and \nhydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and other \nimmunosuppressive agents including Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha-Inhibitors has not been \nadequately studied up to now in randomised trials (with the exception of methotrexate, see \nsection 4.5). The risk associated with combination therapy, in particular in long-term treatment, is \nunknown. Since such therapy can lead to additive or even synergistic toxicity (e.g. hepato- or \nhaematotoxicity), combination with another DMARD (e.g. methotrexate) is not advisable. \n \nCo-administration of teriflunomide with leflunomide is not recommended, as leflunomide is the parent \ncompound of teriflunomide. \n \nSwitching to other treatments \n \nAs leflunomide has a long persistence in the body, a switching to another DMARD (e.g. methotrexate) \nwithout performing the washout procedure (see below) may raise the possibility of additive risks even \nfor a long time after the switching (i.e. kinetic interaction, organ toxicity). \n \nSimilarly, recent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. methotrexate) \nmay result in increased side effects; therefore, the initiation of leflunomide treatment has to carefully \nbe considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects and closer monitoring is recommended in the initial \nphase after switching. \n \nSkin reactions \n \nIn case of ulcerative stomatitis, leflunomide administration should be discontinued. \n \nVery rare cases of Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis and Drug Reaction with \nEosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with \nleflunomide. As soon as skin and/or mucosal reactions are observed which raise the suspicion of such \nsevere reactions, Repso and any other possibly associated treatment must be discontinued, and a \nleflunomide washout procedure initiated immediately. A complete washout is essential in such cases. \nIn such cases re-exposure to leflunomide is contra-indicated (see section 4.3). \n \nPustular psoriasis and worsening of psoriasis have been reported after the use of leflunomide. \nTreatment withdrawal may be considered taking into account patient’s disease and past history. \n \nInfections \n \nIt is known that medicinal products with immunosuppressive properties - like leflunomide - may cause \npatients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections. Infections may be \nmore severe in nature and may, therefore, require early and vigorous treatment. In the event that \nsevere, uncontrolled infections occur, it may be necessary to interrupt leflunomide treatment and \nadminister a washout procedure as described below. \n \nRare cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported in patients \nreceiving leflunomide among other immunosuppressants. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nBefore starting treatment, all patients should be evaluated for active and inactive (“latent”) \ntuberculosis, as per local recommendations. This can include medical history, possible previous \ncontact with tuberculosis, and/or appropriate screening such as lung x-ray, tuberculin test and/or \ninterferon-gamma release assay, as applicable. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative \ntuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \nPatients with a history of tuberculosis should be carefully monitored because of the possibility of \nreactivation of the infection. \n \nRespiratory reactions \n \nInterstitial lung disease, as well as rare cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported during \ntreatment with leflunomide (see section 4.8). The risk of their occurrence can be increased in patients \nwith a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder, which \nmay occur acutely during therapy. Pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, may be a \nreason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation, as appropriate. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \n \nCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving Repso. Most patients \nimproved after discontinuation of Repso. However there was a wide variability in final outcome, i.e. in \nsome patients the neuropathy resolved and some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 \nyears, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral \nneuropathy. If a patient taking Repso develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing Repso \ntherapy and performing the drug elimination procedure (see section 4.4). \n \nBlood pressure \n \nBlood pressure must be checked before the start of leflunomide treatment and periodically thereafter. \n \nProcreation (recommendations for men) \n \nMale patients should be aware of the possible male-mediated foetal toxicity. Reliable contraception \nduring treatment with leflunomide should also be guaranteed. \n \nThere are no specific data on the risk of male-mediated foetal toxicity. However, animal studies to \nevaluate this specific risk have not been conducted. To minimise any possible risk, men wishing to \nfather a child should consider discontinuing use of leflunomide and taking colestyramine 8 g 3 times \ndaily for 11 days or 50 g of activated powdered charcoal 4 times daily for 11 days. \n \nIn either case the A771726 plasma concentration is then measured for the first time. Thereafter, the \nA771726 plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least 14 days. If both \nplasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l, and after a waiting period of at least 3 months, the risk of \nfoetal toxicity is very low. \n \nWashout procedure \n \nColestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily. Alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal is \nadministered 4 times daily. Duration of a complete washout is usually 11 days. The duration may be \nmodified depending on clinical or laboratory variables. \n \nLactose \n \nRepso contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nInteractions studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nIncreased side effects may occur in case of recent or concomitant use of hepatotoxic or haematotoxic \ndrugs or when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a washout period (see also \nguidance concerning combination with other treatments, section 4.4). Therefore, closer monitoring of \nliver enzymes and haematological parameters is recommended in the initial phase after switching. \n \nMethotrexate \n \nIn a small (n=30) study with co-administration of leflunomide (10 to 20 mg per day) with \nmethotrexate (10 to 25 mg per week) a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen on 5 of \n30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of \nleflunomide. A more than 3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 \nwith continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no pharmacokinetic interaction between the leflunomide (10 to \n20 mg per day) and methotrexate (10 to 25 mg per week) was demonstrated. \n \nVaccinations \n \nNo clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations under leflunomide treatment. \nVaccination with live attenuated vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of \nleflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live attenuated vaccine after \nstopping Repso. \n \nWarfarin and other coumarine anticoagulants \n \nThere have been case reports of increased prothrombin time, when leflunomide and warfarin were \nco-administered. A pharmacodynamics interaction with warfarin was observed with A771726 in a \nclinical pharmacology study (see below). Therefore, when warfarin or another coumarin anticoagulant \nis co-administered, close international normalised ratio (INR) follow-up and monitoring is \nrecommended. \n \nNSAIDs/Corticosteroids \n \nIf the patient is already receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or \ncorticosteroids, these may be continued after starting leflunomide. \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on leflunomide \n \nCholestyramine or activated charcoal \n \nIt is recommended that patients receiving leflunomide are not treated with colestyramine or activated \npowdered charcoal because this leads to a rapid and significant decrease in plasma A771726 (the \nactive metabolite of leflunomide; see also section 5) concentration. The mechanism is thought to be by \ninterruption of enterohepatic recycling and/or gastrointestinal dialysis of A771726. \n \nCYP450 inhibitors and inducers \n \nIn vitro inhibition studies in human liver microsomes suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C19 \nand 3A4 are involved in leflunomide metabolism. An in vivo interaction study with leflunomide and \ncimetidine (non-specific weak cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor) has demonstrated a lack of a \nsignificant impact on A771726 exposure. Following concomitant administration of a single dose of \nleflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampicin (non-specific cytochrome P450 \ninducer) A771726 peak levels were increased by approximately 40 %, whereas the AUC was not \nsignificantly changed. The mechanism of this effect is unclear. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nEffect of leflunomide on other medicinal products \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nIn a study in which leflunomide was given concomitantly with a triphasic oral contraceptive pill \ncontaining 30 μg ethinyloestradiol to healthy female volunteers, there was no reduction in \ncontraceptive activity of the pill, and A771726 pharmacokinetics were within predicted ranges. A \npharmacokinetic interaction with oral contraceptives was observed with A771726 (see below). \n \nThe following pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted with \nA771726 (principal active metabolite of leflunomide). As similar drug-drug interactions cannot be \nexcluded for leflunomide at recommended doses, the following study results and recommendations \nshould be considered in patients treated with leflunomide: \n \nEffect on repaglinide (CYP2C8 substrate) \n \nThere was an increase in mean repaglinide Cmax and AUC (1.7- and 2.4-fold, respectively), following \nrepeated doses of A771726, suggesting that A771726 is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. Therefore, \nmonitoring patients with concomitant use of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8, such as \nrepaglinide, paclitaxel, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, is recommended as they may have higher \nexposure. \n \nEffect on caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) \n \nRepeated doses of A771726 decreased mean Cmax and AUC of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) by 18% \nand 55%, respectively, suggesting that A771726 may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. \nTherefore, medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as duloxetine, alosetron, theophylline \nand tizanidine) should be used with caution during treatment, as it could lead to the reduction of the \nefficacy of these products. \n \nEffect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates \n \nThere was an increase in mean cefaclor Cmax and AUC (1.43- and 1.54-fold, respectively), following \nrepeated doses of A771726, suggesting that A771726 is an inhibitor of OAT3 in vivo. Therefore, when \nco-administered with substrates of OAT3, such as cefaclor, benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin, \nindomethacin, ketoprofen, furosemide, cimetidine, methotrexate, zidovudine, caution is recommended. \n \nEffect on BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) and /or organic anion transporting polypeptide \nB1 and B3 (OATP1B1/B3) substrates \n \nThere was an increase in mean rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC (2.65- and 2.51-fold, respectively), \nfollowing repeated doses of A771726. However, there was no apparent impact of this increase in \nplasma rosuvastatin exposure on the HMG-CoA reductase activity. If used together, the dose of \nrosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, \ntopotecan, sulfasalazine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin) and the OATP family especially HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitors (e.g., simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, methotrexate, nateglinide, repaglinide, \nrifampicin) concomitant administration should also be undertaken with caution. Patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs and symptoms of excessive exposure to the medicinal products and \nreduction of the dose of these medicinal products should be considered. \n \nEffect on oral contraceptive (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel) \n \nThere was an increase in mean ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.58- and 1.54-fold, respectively) \nand levonorgestrel Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.33- and 1.41-fold, respectively) following repeated doses of \nA771726. While this interaction is not expected to adversely impact the efficacy of oral \ncontraceptives, consideration should be given to the type of oral contraceptive treatment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nEffect on warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) \n \nRepeated doses of A771726 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin, indicating that \nA771726 is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C9. However, a 25% decrease in peak international \nnormalised ratio (INR) was observed when A771726 was co-administered with warfarin as compared \nwith warfarin alone. Therefore, when warfarin is co-administered, close INR follow-up and \nmonitoring is recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726 is suspected to cause serious birth defects when \nadministered during pregnancy. Repso is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 2 years after \ntreatment (see “waiting period” below) or up to 11 days after treatment (see abbreviated “washout \nperiod” below). \n \nThe patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect \npregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing, and if positive, the \nphysician and patient must discuss the risk to the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering the \nblood level of the active metabolite, by instituting the drug elimination procedure described below, at \nthe first delay of menses may decrease the risk to the foetus from leflunomide. \n \nIn a small prospective study in women (n=64) who became inadvertently pregnant while taking \nleflunomide for no more than three weeks after conception and followed by a drug elimination \nprocedure, no significant differences (p=0.13) were observed in the overall rate of major structural \ndefects (5.4%) compared to either of the comparison groups (4.2% in the disease matched group \n[n=108] and 4.2% in healthy pregnant women [n=78]). \n \nFor women receiving leflunomide treatment and who wish to become pregnant, one of the following \nprocedures is recommended in order to ascertain that the foetus is not exposed to toxic concentrations \nof A771726 (target concentration below 0.02 mg/l): \n \nWaiting period \n \nA771726 plasma levels can be expected to be above 0.02 mg/l for a prolonged period. The \nconcentration may be expected to decrease below 0.02 mg/l about 2 years after stopping the treatment \nwith leflunomide. \n \nAfter a 2-year waiting period, the A771726 plasma concentration is measured for the first time. \nThereafter, the A771726 plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least \n14 days. If both plasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l no teratogenic risk is to be expected. \n \nFor further information on the sample testing please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or its \nlocal representative (see section 7). \n \nWashout procedure \n \nAfter stopping treatment with leflunomide: \n\n colestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily for a period of 11 days, \n alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal is administered 4 times daily for a period \n\nof 11 days. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nHowever, also following either of the washout procedures, verification by 2 separate tests at an \ninterval of at least 14 days and a waiting period of one-and-a-half months between the first occurrence \nof a plasma concentration below 0.02 mg/l and fertilisation is required. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be told that a waiting period of 2 years after treatment \ndiscontinuation is required before they may become pregnant. If a waiting period of up to \napproximately 2 years under reliable contraception is considered unpractical, prophylactic institution \nof a washout procedure may be advisable. \n \nBoth colestyramine and activated powdered charcoal may influence the absorption of oestrogens and \nprogestogens such that reliable contraception with oral contraceptives may not be guaranteed during \nthe washout procedure with colestyramine or activated powdered charcoal. Use of alternative \ncontraceptive methods is recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAnimal studies indicate that leflunomide or its metabolites pass into breast milk. Breast-feeding \nwomen must, therefore, not receive leflunomide. \n \nFertility \nResults of animal fertility studies have shown no effect on male and female fertility, but adverse \neffects on male reproductive organs were observed in repeated dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIn the case of side effects such as dizziness the patient's ability to concentrate and to react properly \nmay be impaired. In such cases patients should refrain from driving cars and using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse effects with leflunomide are: mild increase in blood pressure, \nleucopenia, paraesthesia, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, oral mucosal disorders \n(e.g. aphthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration), abdominal pain, increased hair loss, eczema, rash \n(including maculo-papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, tenosynovitis, CPK increased, anorexia, weight \nloss (usually insignificant), asthenia, mild allergic reactions and elevation of liver parameters \n(transaminases (especially ALT), less often gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatise, bilirubin. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \n \nRare:   severe infections, including sepsis which may be fatal \n \nLike other agents with immunosuppressive potential, leflunomide may increase susceptibility to \ninfections, including opportunistic infections (see also section 4.4). Thus, the overall incidence of \ninfections can increase (in particular of rhinitis, bronchitis and pneumonia). \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with use of some \nimmunosuppressive agents. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nCommon:   leucopenia (leucocytes > 2 G/l) \nUncommon:  anaemia, mild thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 G/l) \nRare:   pancytopenia (probably by antiproliferative mechanism), leucopenia (leucocytes \n\n < 2 G/l), eosinophilia \nVery rare:   agranulocytosis \n \nRecent, concomitant or consecutive use of potentially myelotoxic agents may be associated with a \nhigher risk of haematological effects. \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nCommon:   mild allergic reactions \nVery rare:   severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, vasculitis, including cutaneous \n\nnecrotizing vasculitis \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n \nCommon:   CPK increased \nUncommon:  hypokalaemia, hyperlipidemia, hypophosphataemia \nRare:    LDH increased \nNot known:   hypouricemia \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nUncommon:  anxiety \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nCommon:   paraesthesia, headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nCommon:   mild increase in blood pressure \nRare:    severe increase in blood pressure \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nRare:    interstitial lung disease (including interstitial pneumonitis), which may be fatal \nNot known:  pulmonary hypertension \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nCommon:   diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, oral mucosal disorders (e.g., aphthous stomatitis, \n\nmouth ulceration), abdominal pain; colitis including microscopic colitis such as \nlymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis \n\nUncommon:  taste disturbances \nVery rare:   pancreatitis \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nCommon:   elevation of liver parameters (transaminases [especially ALT], less often \n\ngamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nRare:    hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis \nVery rare:   severe liver injury such as hepatic failure and acute hepatic necrosis that may be \n\nfatal \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nCommon:   increased hair loss, eczema, rash (including maculopapular rash), pruritus, dry skin \nUncommon:  urticaria \nVery rare:   toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme \nNot known:  cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or worsening psoriasis, Drug \n\nReaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nCommon:   tenosynovitis \nUncommon:  tendon rupture \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNot known:   renal failure \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n \nNot known:   marginal (reversible) decreases in sperm concentration, total sperm count and rapid \n\nprogressive motility \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nCommon:   anorexia, weight loss (usually insignificant), asthenia \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThere have been reports of chronic overdose in patients taking leflunomide at daily doses up to five \ntimes the recommended daily dose, and reports of acute overdose in adults and children. There were \nno adverse events reported in the majority of case reports of overdose. Adverse events consistent with \nthe safety profile for leflunomide were: abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, elevated liver enzymes, \nanaemia, leucopenia, pruritus and rash. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of an overdose or toxicity, colestyramine or charcoal is recommended to accelerate \nelimination. Colestyramine given orally at a dose of 8 g three times a day for 24 hours to three healthy \nvolunteers decreased plasma levels of A771726 by approximately 40 % in 24 hours and by 49 % to \n65 % in 48 hours. \n \nAdministration of activated charcoal (powder made into a suspension) orally or via nasogastric tube \n(50 g every 6 hours for 24 hours) has been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of the active \nmetabolite A771726 by 37 % in 24 hours and by 48 % in 48 hours. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n13 \n\nThese washout procedures may be repeated if clinically necessary. \n \nStudies with both hemodialysis and CAPD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) indicate that \nA771726, the primary metabolite of leflunomide, is not dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA13.  \n \nHuman pharmacology \n \nLeflunomide is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agent with antiproliferative properties. \n \nAnimal pharmacology \n \nLeflunomide is effective in animal models of arthritis and of other autoimmune diseases and \ntransplantation, mainly if administered during the sensitisation phase. It has \nimmunomodulating/immunosuppressive characteristics, acts as an antiproliferative agent, and displays \nanti-inflammatory properties. Leflunomide exhibits the best protective effects on animal models of \nautoimmune diseases when administered in the early phase of the disease progression. \n \nIn vivo, it is rapidly and almost completely metabolised to A771726 which is active in vitro, and is \npresumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nA771726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotate \ndehydrogenase (DHODH) and exhibits antiproliferative activity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe efficacy of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated in 4 controlled \ntrials (1 in phase II and 3 in phase III). The phase II trial, study YU203, randomised 402 subjects with \nactive rheumatoid arthritis to placebo (n=102), leflunomide 5 mg (n=95), 10 mg (n=101) or 25 mg/day \n(n=104). The treatment duration was 6 months. \n \nAll leflunomide patients in the phase III trials used an initial dose of 100 mg for 3 days. \n \nStudy MN301 randomised 358 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day \n(n=133), sulphasalazine 2 g/day (n=133), or placebo (n=92). Treatment duration was 6 months. \n \nStudy MN303 was an optional 6-month blinded continuation of MN301 without the placebo arm, \nresulting in a 12-month comparison of leflunomide and sulphasalazine. \n \nStudy MN302 randomised 999 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day \n(n=501) or methotrexate at 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=498). Folate supplementation \nwas optional and only used in 10 % of patients. Treatment duration was 12-months. \n \nStudy US301 randomised 482 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis to leflunomide 20 mg/day \n(n=182), methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n=182), or placebo (n=118). All \npatients received folate 1 mg bid. Treatment duration was 12 months. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nLeflunomide at a daily dose of at least 10 mg (10 to 25 mg in study YU203, 20 mg in studies MN301 \nand US301) was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of \nrheumatoid arthritis in all 3 placebo-controlled trials. The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) \nresponse rates in study YU203 were 27.7 % for placebo, 31.9 % for 5 mg, 50.5 % for 10 mg and \n54.5 % for 25 mg/day. In the phase III trials, the ACR response rates for leflunomide 20 mg/day \nversus placebo were 54.6 % versus 28.6 % (study MN301), and 49.4 % versus 26.3 % (study \nUS301).After 12 months with active treatment, the ACR response rates in leflunomide patients were \n52.3 % (studies MN301/303), 50.5 % (study MN302) and 49.4 % (study US301), compared to 53.8 % \n(studies MN301/303) in sulphasalazine patients, 64.8 % (study MN302), and 43.9 % (study US301) in \nmethotrexate patients. In study MN302 leflunomide was significantly less effective than methotrexate. \nHowever, in study US301 no significant differences were observed between leflunomide and \nmethotrexate in the primary efficacy parameters. No difference was observed between leflunomide \nand sulphasalazine (study MN301). The leflunomide treatment effect was evident by 1 month, \nstabilised by 3 to 6 months and continued throughout the course of treatment. \n \nA randomised, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority study compared the relative efficacy of two \ndifferent daily maintenance doses of leflunomide, 10 mg and 20 mg. From the results it can be \nconcluded that efficacy results of the 20 mg maintenance dose were more favourable, on the other \nhand, the safety results favoured the 10 mg daily maintenance dose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLeflunomide was studied in a single multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in \n94 patients (47 per arm) with polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were \n3-17 years of age with active polyarticular course JRA regardless of onset type and naive to \nmethotrexate or leflunomide. In this trial, the loading dose and maintenance dose of leflunomide was \nbased on three weight categories: < 20 kg, 20-40 kg, and > 40 kg. After 16 weeks treatment, the \ndifference in response rates was statistically significant in favour of methotrexate for the JRA \nDefinition of Improvement (DOI) ≥ 30 % (p = 0.02). In responders, this response was maintained \nduring 48 weeks. (see section 4.2). \n \nThe pattern of adverse events of leflunomide and methotrexate seems to be similar, but the dose used \nin lighter subjects resulted in a relatively low exposure (see section 5.2). These data do not allow an \neffective and safe dose recommendation. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nThe efficacy of leflunomide was demonstrated in one controlled, randomised, double blind study 3L01 \nin 188 patients with psoriatic arthritis, treated at 20 mg/day. Treatment duration was 6 months. \n \nLeflunomide 20 mg/day was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the symptoms of arthritis in \npatients with psoriatic arthritis: the PsARC (Psoriatic Arthritis treatment Response Criteria) \nresponders were 59 % in the leflunomide group and 29.7 % in the placebo group by 6 months \n(p < 0.0001). The effect of leflunomide on improvement of function and on reduction of skin lesions \nwas modest. \n \nPostmarketing Studies \n \nA randomised study assessed the clinical efficacy response rate in DMARD-naïve patients (n=121) \nwith early RA, who received either 20 mg or 100 mg of leflunomide in two parallel groups during the \ninitial three day double blind period. The initial period was followed by an open label maintenance \nperiod of three months, during which both groups received leflunomide 20 mg daily. No incremental \noverall benefit was observed in the studied population with the use of a loading dose regimen. The \nsafety data obtained from both treatment groups were consistent with the known safety profile of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nleflunomide, however, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and of elevated liver enzymes \ntended to be higher in the patients receiving the loading dose of 100 mg leflunomide. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nLeflunomide is rapidly converted to the active metabolite, A771726, by first-pass metabolism (ring \nopening) in gut wall and liver. In a study with radiolabelled 14C-leflunomide in three healthy \nvolunteers, no unchanged leflunomide was detected in plasma, urine or faeces. In other studies, \nunchanged leflunomide levels in plasma have rarely been detected, however, at ng/ml plasma levels. \nThe only plasma-radiolabelled metabolite detected was A771726. This metabolite is responsible for \nessentially all the in vivo activity of leflunomide. \n \nAbsorption \n \nExcretion data from the 14C study indicated that at least about 82 to 95 % of the dose is absorbed. The \ntime to peak plasma concentrations of A771726 is very variable; peak plasma levels can occur \nbetween 1 hour and 24 hours after single administration. Leflunomide can be administered with food, \nsince the extent of absorption is comparable in the fed and fasting state. Due to the very long \nhalf-lifeof A771726 (approximately 2 weeks), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinical \nstudies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady-state levels of A771726. Without a loading dose, it \nis estimated that attainment of steady-state plasma concentrations would require nearly two months of \ndosing. In multiple dose studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof A771726 were linear over the dose range of 5 to 25 mg. In these studies, the clinical effect was \nclosely related to the plasma concentration of A771726 and to the daily dose of leflunomide. At a dose \nlevel of 20 mg/day, average plasma concentration of A771726 at steady state is approximately \n35 μg/ml. At steady state plasma levels accumulate about 33- to 35-fold compared with single dose. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn human plasma, A771726 is extensively bound to protein (albumin). The unbound fraction of \nA771726 is about 0.62 %. Binding of A771726 is linear in the therapeutic concentration range. \nBinding of A771726 appeared slightly reduced and more variable in plasma from patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis or chronic renal insufficiency. The extensive protein binding of A771726 could \nlead to displacement of other highly-bound drugs. In vitro plasma protein binding interaction studies \nwith warfarin at clinically relevant concentrations, however, showed no interaction. Similar studies \nshowed that ibuprofen and diclofenac did not displace A771726, whereas the unbound fraction of \nA771726 is increased 2- to 3-fold in the presence of tolbutamide. A771726 displaced ibuprofen, \ndiclofenac and tolbutamide but the unbound fraction of these drugs is only increased by 10 % to 50 %. \nThere is no indication that these effects are of clinical relevance. Consistent with extensive protein \nbinding A771726 has a low apparent volume of distribution (approximately 11 litres). There is no \npreferential uptake in erythrocytes. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLeflunomide is metabolised to one primary (A771726) and many minor metabolites including TFMA \n(4-trifluoromethylaniline). The metabolic biotransformation of leflunomide to A771726 and \nsubsequent metabolism of A771726 is not controlled by a single enzyme and has been shown to occur \nin microsomal and cytosolic cellular fractions. Interaction studies with cimetidine (non-specific \ncytochrome P450 inhibitor) and rifampicin (non-specific cytochrome P450 inducer), indicate that in \nvivo CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of leflunomide only to a small extent. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination of A771726 is slow and characterised by an apparent clearance of about 31 ml/hr. The \nelimination half-life in patients is approximately 2 weeks. After administration of a radiolabelled dose \nof leflunomide, radioactivity was equally excreted in faeces, probably by biliary elimination, and in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nurine. A771726 was still detectable in urine and faeces 36 days after a single administration. The \nprincipal urinary metabolites were glucuronide products derived from leflunomide (mainly in 0 to \n24 hour samples) and an oxanilic acid derivative of A771726. The principal faecal component was \nA771726. \n \nIt has been shown in man that administration of an oral suspension of activated powdered charcoal or \ncolestyramine leads to a rapid and significant increase in A771726 elimination rate and decline in \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.9). This is thought to be achieved by a gastrointestinal dialysis \nmechanism and/or by interrupting enterohepatic recycling. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nLeflunomide was administered as a single oral 100 mg dose to 3 haemodialysis patients and 3 patients \non continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The pharmacokinetics of A771726 in CAPD subjects \nappeared to be similar to healthy volunteers. A more rapid elimination of A771726 was observed in \nhaemodialysis subjects which was not due to extraction of drug in the dialysate. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo data are available regarding treatment of patients with hepatic impairment. The active metabolite \nA771726 is extensively protein bound and cleared via hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion. These \nprocesses may be affected by hepatic dysfunction. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of A771726 following oral administration of leflunomide have been \ninvestigated in 73 pediatric patients with polyarticular course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) \nwho ranged in age from 3 to 17 years. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis of these \ntrials have demonstrated that pediatric patients with body weights ≤ 40 kg have a reduced systemic \nexposure (measured by Css) of A771726 relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nPharmacokinetic data in elderly people (> 65 years) are limited but consistent with pharmacokinetics \nin younger adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLeflunomide, administered orally and intraperitoneally, has been studied in acute toxicity studies in \nmice and rats. Repeated oral administration of leflunomide to mice for up to 3 months, to rats and dogs \nfor up to 6 months and to monkeys for up to 1 month's duration revealed that the major target organs \nfor toxicity were bone marrow, blood, gastrointestinal tract, skin, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. \nThe main effects were anaemia, leucopenia, decreased platelet counts and panmyelopathy and reflect \nthe basic mode of action of the compound (inhibition of DNA synthesis). In rats and dogs, Heinz \nbodies and/or Howell-Jolly bodies were found. Other effects found on heart, liver, cornea and \nrespiratory tract could be explained as infections due to immunosuppression. Toxicity in animals was \nfound at doses equivalent to human therapeutic doses. \n \nLeflunomide was not mutagenic. However, the minor metabolite TFMA (4-trifluoromethylaniline) \ncaused clastogenicity and point mutations in vitro, whilst insufficient information was available on its \npotential to exert this effect in vivo. \n \nIn a carcinogenicity study in rats, leflunomide did not show carcinogenic potential. In a \ncarcinogenicity study in mice an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma occurred in males of the \nhighest dose group, considered to be due to the immunosuppressive activity of leflunomide. In female \nmice an increased incidence, dose-dependent, of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nlung was noted. The relevance of the findings in mice relative to the clinical use of leflunomide is \nuncertain. \n \nLeflunomide was not antigenic in animal models. \n \nLeflunomide was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses in the human therapeutic \nrange and exerted adverse effects on male reproductive organs in repeated dose toxicity studies. \nFertility was not reduced. \n \n \n6.

What Repso is and what it is used for \n \nRepso belongs to a group of medicines called anti-rheumatic medicines. It contains the active \nsubstance leflunomide. \n \nRepso is used to treat adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis or with active psoriatic arthritis. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is a crippling form of arthritis. The symptoms include inflammation of joints, \nswelling, difficulty moving and pain. Other symptoms that affect the entire body include loss of \nappetite, fever, loss of energy and anemia (lack of red blood cells). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is the combination of psoriasis and arthritis. The symptoms include inflammation of \njoints, swelling, difficulty moving, pain and patches of red, scaly skin (skin lesions). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Repso  \n \nDo not take Repso \n- If you are allergic to leflunomide (especially a serious skin reaction, often with fever, joint pain, \n\nred skin stains, or blisters e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome) or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6), or if you are allergic to teriflunomide (used to treat multiple \nsclerosis). \n\n- If you have liver problems. \n- If you suffer from a severe condition that affects your immune system e.g. AIDS. \n- If you have bone marrow problems, or if you have low numbers of red or white blood cells or \n\na reduced number of blood platelets, due to causes other than rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis. \n- If you have a serious infection. \n- If you suffer from moderate to severe kidney problems. \n- If you have very low levels of protein in your blood (hypoproteinaemia). \n- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding. \n- If you are woman of child-bearing age and not using effective contraception. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Repso \n- If you already have low red or white blood cells (anaemia or leucopenia), low blood platelets, \n\nwhich may increase your bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia), low bone marrow function \nor if you are at risk of your bone marrow not working properly your doctor may advise you to \ntake certain medicines to speed up the removal of Repso from your body. \n\n- If you develop swollen spongy gums, ulcers, and loose teeth (an infectious mouth disease \nknown as ulcerative stomatitis) then you should contact your doctor who may advise you to stop \ntaking Repso.   \n\n- If you switch to another medicine to treat your rheumatoid arthritis or if you have recently \ntaken medicines that may be harmful to your liver or blood, your doctor may advise you to take \ncertain medicines to speed up the removal of Repso from your body or may closely monitor you \nwhen you start taking Repso. \n\n- If you have ever had interstitial lung disease (feeling a shortness of breath). \n- If you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close contact with someone who has or \n\nhas had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if you have tuberculosis. \n- If you are male and wish to father a child. As it cannot be excluded that Repso passes into \n\nsemen, reliable contraception should be used during treatment with Repso. Men wishing to \nfather a child should contact their doctor who may advise them to stop taking Repso and take \ncertain medicines to remove Repso rapidly and sufficiently from their body. You will then need \na blood test to make sure that Repso has been sufficiently removed from your body, and you \nshould then wait for at least another 3 months before attempting to father a child. \n\n \nRepso can occasionally cause some problems with your blood, liver, lungs, or nerves in your arms or \nlegs. It may also cause some serious allergic reactions (including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and \nSystemic Symptoms [DRESS]), or increase the chance of a severe infection. For more information on \nthese, please read section 4 (Possible Side Effects). \n \nDRESS appears initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high \ntemperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type of white \nblood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. \n \nBefore and during treatment with Repso, your doctor will carry out blood tests at regular times. This \nis to monitor your blood cells and liver. Since Repso can cause an increase in your blood pressure, \nyour doctor will also check your blood pressure regularly. \n \nTell your doctor if you have unexplained chronic diarrhoea. Your doctor may perform additional tests \nfor differential diagnosis. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nRepso is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Repso \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nEspecially if you are taking any of the following: \n- Other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis such as antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine and \n\nhydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and other \nimmunosuppressive medicines (e.g. methotrexate) as these combinations are not advisable  \n\n- Warfarin and other oral medicines used to thin the blood, as monitoring is necessary to reduce \nthe risk of side effects of this medicine \n\n- Teriflunomide for multiple sclerosis \n- Repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes \n- Daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer \n- Duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinence or in kidney disease in diabetics \n- Alosetron for the management of severe diarrhoea \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\n- Theophylline for asthma \n- Tizanidine, a muscle relaxant \n- Oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) \n- Cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections \n- Indomethacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation \n- Furosemide for heart disease (diuretic, water pill) \n- Zidovudine for HIV infection \n- Rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high \n\ncholesterol) \n- Sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis \n- Colestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels and treat itching associated with jaundice) or \n\nactivated charcoal as these medicines can reduce the amount of Repso absorbed by your body. \n- Cimetidine, medicine for the treatment of heartburn and peptic ulcers \n \nIf you are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or corticosteroids, \nyou may continue to use these after starting Repso. \n \nVaccinations \nPlease discuss with your doctor if you have to take any vaccinations. Some vaccinations should not be \ngiven while taking Repso, and for a certain amount of time after stopping treatment. \n \nRepso with food, drink and alcohol \nDrinking alcohol while taking Repso may increase the chance of liver damage. Therefore, it is not \nrecommended to drink alcohol during treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Repso if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant \nwhile taking Repso, the risk of having a baby with serious birth defects is increased. Women of \nchildbearing potential must not take Repso without using reliable contraceptive measures, and they \nmust use reliable contraceptive measures up to 2 years after treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Repso, as you need to \nensure that all traces of Repso have left your body before trying to become pregnant. This may take up \nto 2 years. This may be reduced to a few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal \nof Repso from your body. \nIn either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that Repso has been sufficiently removed from \nyour body and you should then wait for at least another month before you become pregnant. \n \nFor further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. \n \nIf you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Repso or in the two years after you have stopped \ntreatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms that \nyou are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove Repso rapidly \nand sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. \n \nDo not take Repso when you are breast-feeding, as leflunomide passes into the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRepso may make you dizzy. This may affect your ability to concentrate or react properly. If this \nhappens to you, do not drive or use machines.  \n \n \nRepso contains lactose.

For more information on \nthese, please read section 4 (Possible Side Effects). \n \nDRESS appears initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high \ntemperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type of white \nblood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. \n \nBefore and during treatment with Repso, your doctor will carry out blood tests at regular times. This \nis to monitor your blood cells and liver. Since Repso can cause an increase in your blood pressure, \nyour doctor will also check your blood pressure regularly. \n \nTell your doctor if you have unexplained chronic diarrhoea. Your doctor may perform additional tests \nfor differential diagnosis. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRepso is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Repso \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nEspecially if you are taking any of the following: \n- Other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis such as antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine and \n\nhydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and other \nimmunosuppressive medicines (e.g. methotrexate) as these combinations are not advisible \n\n- Warfarin and other oral medicines used to thin the blood, as monitoring is necessary to reduce \nthe risk of side effects of this medicine \n\n- Teriflunomide for multiple sclerosis \n- Repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes \n- Daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer \n- Duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinence or in kidney disease in diabetics \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n\n- Alosetron for the management of severe diarrhoea \n- Theophylline for asthma \n- Tizanidine, a muscle relaxant \n- Oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) \n- Cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections \n- Indomethacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation \n- Furosemide for heart disease (diuretic, water pill) \n- Zidovudine for HIV infection \n- Rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high \n\ncholesterol) \n- Sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis \n- Colestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels and treat itching associated with jaundice) or \n\nactivated charcoal as these medicines can reduce the amount of Repso absorbed by your body. \n- Cimetidine, medicine for the treatment of heartburn and peptic ulcers \n \n \nIf you are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or corticosteroids, \nyou may continue to use these after starting Repso. \n \nVaccinations \nPlease discuss with your doctor if you have to take any vaccinations. Some vaccinations should not be \ngiven while taking Repso, and for a certain amount of time after stopping treatment. \n \nRepso with food, drink and alcohol \nDrinking alcohol while taking Repso may increase the chance of liver damage. Therefore, it is not \nrecommended to drink alcohol during treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Repso if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant \nwhile taking Repso, the risk of having a baby with serious birth defects is increased. Women of \nchildbearing potential must not take Repso without using reliable contraceptive measures, and they \nmust use reliable contraceptive measures up to 2 years after treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Repso, as you need to \nensure that all traces of Repso have left your body before trying to become pregnant. This may take up \nto 2 years. This may be reduced to a few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal \nof Repso from your body. \nIn either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that Repso has been sufficiently removed from \nyour body and you should then wait for at least another month before you become pregnant. \n \nFor further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. \n \nIf you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Repso or in the two years after you have stopped \ntreatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms that \nyou are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove Repso rapidly \nand sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. \n \nDo not take Repso when you are breast-feeding, as leflunomide passes into the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRepso may make you dizzy. This may affect your ability to concentrate or react properly. If this \nhappens to you, do not drive or use machines.  \n \n \nRepso contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n3.
