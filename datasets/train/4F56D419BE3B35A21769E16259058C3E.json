PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nHexyon is a whitish, cloudy suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nHexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers \nfrom six weeks of age against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive \ndiseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). \n \nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination: \nThe primary vaccination consists of 2 doses (with an interval of at least 8 weeks) or 3 doses (with an \ninterval of at least 4 weeks) in accordance with the official recommendations. \n \nAll vaccination schedules including the WHO Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) at 6, 10, 14 \nweeks of age can be used whether or not a dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been given at birth. \n \nWhere a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth; \n\n- Hexyon can be used for supplementary doses of hepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If \na second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine \nshould be used. \n\n- Hexyon can be used for a mixed hexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine \nimmunisation schedule in accordance with official recommendations. \n\n \nBooster vaccination: \nAfter a 2-dose primary vaccination with Hexyon, a booster dose must be given. \nAfter a 3-dose primary vaccination with Hexyon, a booster dose should be given. \n \nBooster doses should be given at least 6 months after the last priming dose and in accordance with the \nofficial recommendations. As a minimum, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered. \n \nIn addition: \nIn the absence of hepatitis B vaccination at birth, it is necessary to give a hepatitis B vaccine booster \ndose. Hexyon can be considered for the booster. \n \nWhen a hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, after a 3-dose primary vaccination, Hexyon or a \npentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine can be administered for the booster. \n \nHexyon may be used as a booster in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with another \nhexavalent vaccine or a pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine associated with a monovalent hepatitis B \nvaccine. \n \nWHO-EPI schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks): \nAfter a WHO-EPI schedule, a booster dose should be given \n\n- As a minimum, a booster dose of polio vaccine should be given \n- In absence of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, a hepatitis B vaccine booster must be given \n- Hexyon can be considered for the booster \n\n \nOther paediatric population: \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Hexyon in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nNo data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1) \n \nMethod of administration  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \nImmunisation must be carried out by intramuscular (IM) injection. The recommended injection sites \nare the antero-lateral area of the upper thigh (preferred site) or the deltoid muscle in older children \n(possibly from 15 months of age). \n \nFor instructions on handling, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic reaction after a previous administration of Hexyon. \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to trace \nresiduals (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B), to any pertussis \nvaccine, or after previous administration of Hexyon or a vaccine containing the same components or \nconstituents. \n \nVaccination with Hexyon is contraindicated if the individual has experienced an encephalopathy of \nunknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following prior vaccination with a pertussis containing \nvaccine (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). \nIn these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and the vaccination course should \nbe continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccines. \n \nPertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with uncontrolled neurologic disorder or \nuncontrolled epilepsy until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has \nstabilised and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHexyon will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae, \nClostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D \n(caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. \nHexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis \nC and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. \n \nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B \ninfection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in \nsuch cases. \n \nHexyon does not protect against infectious diseases caused by other types of Haemophilus influenzae \nor against meningitis of other origins. \n \nPrior to immunisation \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile \nillness or infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not result in the \ndeferral of vaccination. \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the person\u2019s medical history (in particular previous \nvaccinations and possible adverse reactions). The administration of Hexyon must be carefully \nconsidered in individuals who have a history of serious or severe reactions within 48 hours following \nadministration of a vaccine containing similar components. \n \nBefore the injection of any biological medicinal product, the person responsible for administration \nmust take all precautions known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions. As with all \ninjectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available \nin case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nIf any of the following events are known to have occurred after receiving any pertussis containing \nvaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine should be carefully \nconsidered: \n\u2022 Temperature of \u2265 40\u00b0C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause; \n\u2022 Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of \n\nvaccination; \n\u2022 Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting \u2265 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination; \n\u2022 Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \nThere may be some circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks. \n \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Hexyon. Individuals with a history of febrile \nconvulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 days post \nvaccination. \n \nIf Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or brachial neuritis has occurred following receipt of prior vaccine \ncontaining tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based \non careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks, such as whether or not the primary \nvaccination has been completed. Vaccination is usually justified for individuals whose primary \nvaccination is incomplete (i.e. fewer than three doses have been received). \n \nThe immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or \nimmunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or \ndisease. Nevertheless, vaccination of individuals with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV \ninfection is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nImmunogenicity data are available for 105 preterm infants. These data support the use of Hexyon in \npreterm infants. As expected in preterm infants, lower immune response has been observed for some \nantigens, when indirectly compared to term infants, although seroprotective levels have been achieved \n(see section 5.1). No safety data were collected in preterm infants (born \u2264 37 weeks of gestation) in \nclinical trials. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours should be \nconsidered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u2264 28 \nweeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the \nbenefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. \n \nImmune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism. \n \nIn individuals with chronic renal failure, an impaired hepatitis B response is observed and \nadministration of additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered according to the \nantibody level against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nDo not administer by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration. \n \nInterference with laboratory testing \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nSince the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be \nobserved within 1 to 2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to \nconfirm Hib infection during this period. \n \nHexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium \n \nHexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful for \nindividuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up \nbecause the body cannot remove it properly. \nHexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, \nthat is to say essentially \u201cpotassium-free\u201d and \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nHexyon can be administered simultaneously with a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, \nmeasles, mumps, rubella (MMR) containing vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, a meningococcal C \nconjugate vaccine or a meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine, as no clinically \nrelevant interference in the antibody response to each of the antigens have been shown. \n \nThere may be a clinically relevant interference in the antibody response of Hexyon and a varicella \nvaccine and these vaccines should not be administered at the same time. \n \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate injection sites. \n \nHexyon must not be mixed with any other vaccines or other parenterally administered medicinal \nproducts. \n \nNo significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been reported \nexcept in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nInterference with laboratory testing: see section 4.4. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNot applicable. This vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child-bearing age. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot applicable. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na- Summary of the safety profile \nIn clinical studies in individuals who received Hexyon, the most frequently reported reactions include \ninjection-site pain, irritability, crying, and injection-site erythema.  \nSlightly higher solicited reactogenicity was observed after the first dose compared to subsequent \ndoses. \n \nThe safety of Hexyon in children over 24 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials. \n \nb- Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions; \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from available data) \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions from clinical trials and post marketing surveillance \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Events \nImmune system disorders \n \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity reaction \nRare Anaphylactic reaction* \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Anorexia (decreased appetite) \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Crying, somnolence \nCommon Abnormal crying (prolonged crying) \nRare Convulsions with or without fever* \nVery rare  Hypotonic reactions or hypotonic-hyporesponsive \n\nepisodes (HHE) \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nVery common Vomiting \nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRare Rash \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n \n\nVery common Injection-site pain, injection-site erythema, \ninjection-site swelling \nIrritability \nPyrexia (body temperature \u2265 38.0\u00b0C) \n\nCommon Injection-site induration \nUncommon Injection-site nodule \n\nPyrexia (body temperature \u226539.6\u00b0C) \nRare Extensive limb swelling\u2020 \n\n* Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting. \n\u2020 See section c \n \nc- Description of selected adverse reactions \nExtensive limb swelling: Large injection-site reactions (>50 mm), including extensive limb swelling \nfrom the injection site beyond one or both joints, have been reported in children. These reactions start \nwithin 24-72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at \nthe injection site and resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on the \nnumber of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing vaccine, with a greater risk following the 4th \ndose. \n \nd- Potential adverse events (i.e. adverse events which have been reported with other vaccines \ncontaining one or more of the components or constituents of Hexyon and not directly with Hexyon) \n \nNervous system disorders \n- Brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome have been reported after administration of a tetanus \ntoxoid containing vaccine \n- Peripheral neuropathy (polyradiculoneuritis, facial paralysis), optic neuritis, central nervous system \ndemyelination (multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B antigen \ncontaining vaccine \n- Encephalopathy/encephalitis \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nApnoea in very premature infants (\u2264 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nOedematous reaction affecting one or both lower limbs may occur following vaccination with \nHaemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If this reaction occurs, it is mainly after primary \ninjections and within the first few hours following vaccination. Associated symptoms may include \ncyanosis, redness, transient purpura and severe crying. All events should resolve spontaneously \nwithout sequel within 24 hours. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5.

The immune \nresponses to PRP, PT and FHA antigens one month after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 months of age were \nsimilar to those observed one month after a 2-dose priming given at 3 and 5 months of age:  \n\n- anti-PRP titers \u2265 0.15 \u00b5g/ml were observed in 73.0% of individuals,  \n- anti-PT vaccine response in 97.9% of individuals, \n- anti-FHA vaccine response in 98.6% of individuals. \n\n \nPersistence of immune response \n \nStudies on long-term persistence of vaccine induced antibodies following varying infant / toddler \nprimary series and following Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth or not have shown maintenance of \nlevels above the recognized protective levels or antibody thresholds for the vaccine antigens (see \nTable 3). \n \nIn addition, immunity against the hepatitis B component of the vaccine has been shown to persist up to \n9 years of age after a primary series consisting of one dose of Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth \nfollowed by a 3-dose infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age without a toddler booster where 49.3% \nof vaccinees had antibodies \u2265 10 mIU/ml with geometric mean concentrations at 13.3 (95% CI: 8.82 \u2013 \n20.0) mIU/ml. Immune memory against Hepatitis B had been demonstrated by the presence of an \nanamnestic response to a challenge Hepatitis B vaccination at the age of 9 years in 93% of vaccinees \nwith development of geometric mean concentrations at 3692 (95% CI: 1886 \u2013 7225) mIU/ml after \nvaccination. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Seroprotection ratesa at the age of 4.5 years old after vaccination with Hexyon \n\n \nAntibody Thresholds Primary 6-10-14 weeks and booster at  \n\n15-18 months  \n\nPrimary 2-4-6 months \nand booster at 12\u201324 \n\nmonths  \n\nWithout hepatitis B \nat birth \n\nWith hepatitis B \nat birth \n\nWith hepatitis B at \nbirth \n\nN=173b N=103b N=220c \n\n% % % \n\nAnti-diphtheria \n(\uf0b3 0.01 IU/ml)  \n(\uf0b3 0.1 IU/ml) \n\n \n98.2 \n75.3 \n\n \n97 \n\n64.4 \n\n \n100 \n57.2 \n\nAnti-tetanus \n(\uf0b3 0.01 IU/ml) \n(\uf0b3 0.1 IU/ml) \n\n \n100 \n89.5 \n\n \n100 \n82.8 \n\n \n100 \n80.8 \n\nAnti-PTe \n(\uf0b3 8 EU/ml) \n\n \n42.5 \n\n \n23.7 \n\n \n22.2 \n\nAnti-FHAe \n(\uf0b3 8 EU/ml) \n\n \n93.8 \n\n \n89.0 \n\n \n85.6 \n\nAnti-HBs \n(\uf0b3 10 mIU/ml) \n\n \n73.3 \n\n \n96.1 \n\n \n92.3 \n\nAnti-Polio type 1 \n(\uf0b3 8 (1/dilution)) \n\n \nNAd \n\n \nNAd \n\n \n99.5 \n\nAnti-Polio type 2 \n(\uf0b3 8 (1/dilution)) \n\n \nNAd \n\n \nNAd \n\n \n100 \n\nAnti-Polio type 3 \n(\uf0b3 8 (1/dilution)) \n\n \nNAd \n\n \nNAd \n\n \n100 \n\nAnti-PRP \n(\uf0b3 0.15 \u00b5g/ml) \n\n \n98.8 \n\n \n100 \n\n \n100 \n\nN = Number of individuals analysed (per protocol set) \na:   Generally accepted surrogates (PT, FHA) or correlates of protection (other components) \nb:   6, 10, 14 weeks with and without hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Republic of South Africa) \nc:   2, 4, 6 months with hepatitis B vaccination at birth (Colombia)  \nd:   Due to an OPV National Immunisation Days in the country, Polio results have not been analysed \ne:   8 EU/ml corresponds to 4 LLOQ (Lower Limit Of Quantification in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n\nELISA). \n LLOQ value for anti-PT and anti-FHA is 2 EU/ml \n \nImmune responses to Hexyon in preterm infants \n \nImmune responses to Hexyon antigens in preterm (105) infants (born after a gestation period of 28 to \n36 weeks), including 90 infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy and \n15 to women not vaccinated during pregnancy, were evaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination \ncourse at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 months of age. \nOne month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (\u2265 0.01 \nIU/mL), tetanus (\u2265 0.01 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (\u2265 8 (1/dilution)); 89.8% of subjects \nwere seroprotected against hepatitis B (\u2265 10 IU/mL) and 79.4% were seroprotected against Hib \ninvasive diseases (\u2265 0.15 \u00b5g/mL).  \nOne month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (\u2265 0.1 IU/mL), \ntetanus (\u2265 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (\u2265 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nseroprotected against hepatitis B (\u2265 10 IU/mL) and 90.6% were seroprotected against Hib invasive \ndiseases (\u2265 1 \u00b5g/mL). \nRegarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 98.7% and 100% of subjects developed \nantibodies \u2265 8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens respectively. One month after the booster dose \n98.8% of subjects developed antibodies \u2265 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis \nantibody concentrations were increased by 13-fold after primary vaccination and by 6- to 14-fold after \nthe booster dose. \n \nImmune responses to Hexyon in infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy \n \nImmune responses to Hexyon antigens in term (119) and preterm (90) infants born to women \nvaccinated with Tdap vaccine during pregnancy (between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation) were \nevaluated following a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster \ndose at 13 (preterm infants) or 15 (term infants) months of age.  \nOne month after primary vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (\u2265 0.01 \nIU/mL), tetanus (\u2265 0.01 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1 and 3 (\u2265 8 (1/dilution)); 97.3% of subjects \nwere seroprotected against poliovirus type 2 (\u2265 8 (1/dilution)); 94.6% of subjects were seroprotected \nagainst hepatitis B (\u2265 10 IU/mL) and 88.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive diseases (\u2265 0.15 \n\u00b5g/mL).  \nOne month after the booster dose, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria (\u2265 0.1 IU/mL), \ntetanus (\u2265 0.1 IU/mL) and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (\u2265 8 (1/dilution)); 93.9% of subjects were \nseroprotected against hepatitis B (\u2265 10 IU/mL) and 94.0% were seroprotected against Hib invasive \ndiseases (\u2265 1 \u00b5g/mL). \nRegarding pertussis, one month after primary vaccination 99.4% and 100% of subjects developed \nantibodies \u2265 8 EU/mL against PT and FHA antigens respectively. One month after the booster dose \n99.4% of subjects developed antibodies \u2265 8 EU/mL against both PT and FHA antigens. Pertussis \nantibody concentrations were increased by 5- to 9-fold after primary vaccination and by 8- to 19-fold \nafter the booster dose. \n \nEfficacy and effectiveness in protecting against pertussis \n \nVaccine efficacy of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexyon against the most severe \nWHO-defined typical pertussis (\uf0b3 21 days of paroxysmal cough) is documented in a randomised \ndouble-blind study among infants with a 3 dose primary series using a DTaP vaccine in a highly \nendemic country (Senegal). The need for a toddler booster dose was seen in this study. \nThe long term capability of the acellular pertussis (aP) antigens contained in Hexyon to reduce \npertussis incidence and control pertussis disease in the childhood has been demonstrated in a 10-year \nnational pertussis surveillance on pertussis disease in Sweden with the pentavalent DTaP-IPV/Hib \nvaccine using a 3, 5, 12 months schedule. Results of long term follow-up demonstrated a dramatic \nreduction of the pertussis incidence following the second dose regardless of the vaccine used. \n \nEffectiveness in protecting against Hib invasive disease \n \nThe vaccine effectiveness against Hib invasive disease of DTaP and Hib combination vaccines \n(pentavalent and hexavalent including vaccines containing the Hib antigen from Hexyon) has been \ndemonstrated in Germany via an extensive (over five years follow-up period) post-marketing \nsurveillance study. The vaccine effectiveness was of 96.7% for the full primary series, and 98.5% for \nbooster dose (irrespective of priming). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeat dose toxicity and \nlocal tolerance studies. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \nAt the injection sites, chronic histological inflammatory changes were observed, that are expected to \nhave a slow recovery. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\uf0b7 If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Hexyon is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child \n3. How to use Hexyon \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Hexyon \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Hexyon is and what it is used for \n \nHexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. \n \nHexyon helps to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious \ndiseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexyon is given to children from six weeks of age. \n \nThe vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria \nand viruses that cause these different infections: \n\uf0b7 Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection \n\ncauses pain and swelling which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria that cause the disease also \nmake a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys and nerves. \n\n\uf0b7 Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usually caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. \nThe bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to \nbreathe and the possibility of suffocation. \n\n\uf0b7 Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It \ncauses severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a \n\u201cwhooping\u201d sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can \nalso cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung \ninfections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death. \n\n\uf0b7 Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). \nIn some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious \nliver problems, including liver cancer. \n\n\uf0b7 Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to \nparalysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control \nbreathing and swallowing can be fatal. \n\n\uf0b7 Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are serious bacterial infections \nand can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to \nbrain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation \nand swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can \naffect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nImportant information about the protection provided \n \n\uf0b7 Hexyon will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses \n\ntargeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseases with similar symptoms if they are caused \nby other bacteria or viruses. \n\n\uf0b7 The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the \ninfectious diseases against which it protects. \n\n\uf0b7 This vaccine does not protect against infections caused by other types of Haemophilus \ninfluenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro-organisms. \n\n\uf0b7 Hexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, \nhepatitis C and hepatitis E. \n\n\uf0b7 Because symptoms of hepatitis B take a long time to develop, it is possible for unrecognised \nhepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent \nhepatitis B infection in such cases. \n\n\uf0b7 As with any vaccine, Hexyon may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child \n \nTo make sure that Hexyon is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if \nany of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. \n \nDo not use Hexyon if your child: \n \n\uf0b7 has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration \n\nof Hexyon. \n\uf0b7 has had an allergic reaction \n\n- to the active substances, \n- to any of the excipients listed in section 6, \n- to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these \nsubstances are used during the manufacturing process. \n- after previous administration of Hexyon or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, \npoliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib containing vaccines. \n\n\uf0b7 suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior \ndose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). \n\n\uf0b7 has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system \n(uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: \n\uf0b7 has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold or \n\nflu). Vaccination with Hexyon may need to be delayed until your child is better. \n\uf0b7 has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give \n\nfurther doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered: \n- fever of 40\u00b0C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable \ncause. \n- collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) \nwithin 48 hours of vaccination. \n- persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of \nvaccination. \n- fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n\n\uf0b7 previously had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, \nparalysis and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of \narm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\ntetanus toxin). In this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid \nshould be evaluated by your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body\u2019s natural defenses) or \nhas any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. In these cases the immune \nresponse to the vaccine may be decreased. It is normally recommended to wait until the end of \nthe treatment or disease before vaccinating. However children with long standing problems with \ntheir immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Hexyon but the \nprotection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. \n\n\uf0b7 suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability \nof the kidneys to work properly). \n\n\uf0b7 suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your \ndoctor will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. \n\n\uf0b7 has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor \ncuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexyon. \n\n \nOther medicines or vaccines and Hexyon \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines \nor vaccines. \nHexyon can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-\nmumps-rubella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines or meningococcal vaccines. \nWhen given at the same time with other vaccines, Hexyon will be given at different injection sites. \n \nHexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium \n \nHexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if \nyou have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the \nbody cannot remove it properly. \nHexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, \nthat is to say essentially \u201cpotassium-free\u201d and \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n3. How to use Hexyon \n \nHexyon will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are \nequipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible \nside effects). \nHexyon is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your \nchild\u2019s leg or upper arm. The vaccine will never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. \n \nThe recommended dose is as follows: \n \nFirst course of vaccination (primary vaccination) \nYour child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months or three injections \ngiven at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used \naccording to the local vaccination programme. \n \nAdditional injections (booster) \nAfter the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local \nrecommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you \nwhen this dose should be given. \n \nIf you forget one dose of Hexyon \n \nIf your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse \nwho will decide when to give the missed dose. \nIt is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the \ncourse of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) \n \nIf any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where your child received his/her injection, you \nmust consult a doctor IMMEDIATELY: \n\uf0b7 difficulty in breathing \n\uf0b7 blueness of the tongue or lips \n\uf0b7 a rash \n\uf0b7 swelling of the face or throat  \n\uf0b7 sudden and serious malaise with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness and loss of \n\nconsciousness, accelerated heart rate associated with respiratory disorders \n \nWhen these signs or symptoms (signs or symptoms of anaphylactic reaction) occur they usually \ndevelop quickly after the injection is given and while the child is still in the clinic or doctor\u2019s surgery. \n \nSerious allergic reactions are a rare possibility (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) after receiving this \nvaccine. \n \nOther side effects \n \nIf your child experiences any of the following side effects, please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\uf0b7 Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are: \n\n- loss of appetite (anorexia) \n- crying \n- sleepiness (somnolence) \n- vomiting \n- pain, redness or swelling at the injection site \n- irritability \n- fever (temperature 38\u00b0C or higher) \n\n\uf0b7 Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are: \n- abnormal crying (prolonged crying) \n- diarrhoea \n- injection site hardness (induration) \n\n\uf0b7 Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are: \n- allergic reaction \n- lump (nodule) at the injection site \n- high fever (temperature 39.6\u00b0C or higher) \n\n\uf0b7 Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) are: \n- rash \n- large reactions at the injection site (larger than 5 cm), including extensive limb swelling from \nthe injection site beyond one or both joints. These reactions start within 24-72 hours after \nvaccination, may be associated with redness, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site, \nand get better within 3-5 days without the need for treatment.  \n- fits (convulsions) with or without fever. \n\n\uf0b7 Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) are: \n- episodes when your child goes into a shock-like state or is pale, floppy and unresponsive for a \nperiod of time (hypotonic reactions or hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes HHE). \n\n \nPotential side effects \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \nOther side effects not listed above have been reported occasionally with other diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib containing vaccines and not directly with Hexyon: \n\uf0b7 Temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders (Guillain-\n\nBarr\u00e9 syndrome) and severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder (brachial neuritis) \nhave been reported after administration of a tetanus containing vaccine. \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of several nerves causing sensory disorders or weakness of limbs \n(polyradiculoneuritis), facial paralysis, visual disturbances, sudden dimming or loss of vision \n(optic neuritis), inflammatory disease of brain and spinal cord (central nervous system \ndemyelination, multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B \nantigen containing vaccine. \n\n\uf0b7 Swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy/encephalitis). \n\uf0b7 In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \n\nbetween breaths may occur for 2 - 3 days after vaccination. \n\uf0b7 Swelling of one or both feet and lower limbs which may occur along with bluish discoloration of \n\nthe skin (cyanosis), redness, small areas of bleeding under the skin (transient purpura) and \nsevere crying following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If \nthis reaction occurs, it is mainly after first injections and within the first few hours following \nvaccination. All symptoms should disappear completely within 24 hours without need for \ntreatment. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Hexyon \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vaccine in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child \n3. How to use Hexyon \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Hexyon \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Hexyon is and what it is used for \n \nHexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. \n \nHexyon helps to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious \ndiseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexyon is given to children from six weeks of age. \n \nThe vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria \nand viruses that cause these different infections: \n\uf0b7 Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection \n\ncauses pain and swelling which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria that cause the disease also \nmake a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys and nerves. \n\n\uf0b7 Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usually caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. \nThe bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to \nbreathe and the possibility of suffocation. \n\n\uf0b7 Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It \ncauses severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a \n\u201cwhooping\u201d sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can \nalso cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung \ninfections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death. \n\n\uf0b7 Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). \nIn some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious \nliver problems, including liver cancer. \n\n\uf0b7 Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to \nparalysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control \nbreathing and swallowing can be fatal. \n\n\uf0b7 Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are serious bacterial infections \nand can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to \nbrain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation \nand swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can \naffect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints. \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \nImportant information about the protection provided \n \n\uf0b7 Hexyon will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses \n\ntargeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseases with similar symptoms if they are caused \nby other bacteria or viruses. \n\n\uf0b7 The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the \ninfectious diseases against which it protects. \n\n\uf0b7 This vaccine does not protect against infections caused by other types of Haemophilus \ninfluenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro-organisms. \n\n\uf0b7 Hexyon will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, \nhepatitis C and hepatitis E. \n\n\uf0b7 Because symptoms of hepatitis B take a long time to develop, it is possible for unrecognised \nhepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent \nhepatitis B infection in such cases. \n\n\uf0b7 As with any vaccine, Hexyon may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Hexyon is given to your child \n \nTo make sure that Hexyon is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if \nany of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. \n \nDo not use Hexyon if your child: \n \n\uf0b7 has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration \n\nof Hexyon \n\uf0b7 has had an allergic reaction \n\n- to the active substances, \n- to any of the excipients listed in section 6, \n- to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these \nsubstances are used during the manufacturing process \n- after previous administration of Hexyon or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, \npoliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib containing vaccines. \n\n\uf0b7 suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior \ndose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). \n\n\uf0b7 has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system \n(uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: \n\uf0b7 has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold or \n\nflu). Vaccination with Hexyon may need to be delayed until your child is better. \n\uf0b7 has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give \n\nfurther doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered: \n- fever of 40\u00b0C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable \ncause. \n- collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) \nwithin 48 hours of vaccination. \n- persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of \nvaccination. \n- fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. \n\n\uf0b7 previously had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, \nparalysis and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\narm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of \ntetanus toxin). In this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid \nshould be evaluated by your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body\u2019s natural defenses) or \nhas any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. In these cases the immune \nresponse to the vaccine may be decreased. It is normally recommended to wait until the end of \nthe treatment or disease before vaccinating. However children with long standing problems with \ntheir immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Hexyon but the \nprotection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. \n\n\uf0b7 suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability \nof the kidneys to work properly). \n\n\uf0b7 suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your \ndoctor will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. \n\n\uf0b7 has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor \ncuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexyon. \n\n \nOther medicines or vaccines and Hexyon \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines \nor vaccines. \nHexyon can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-\nmumps-rubella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines or meningococcal vaccines.  \nWhen given at the same time with other vaccines, Hexyon will be given at different injection sites. \n \nHexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium \n \nHexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if \nyou have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the \nbody cannot remove it properly. \nHexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, \nthat is to say essentially \u201cpotassium-free\u201d and \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n3. How to use Hexyon \n \nHexyon will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are \nequipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible \nside effects). \nHexyon is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your \nchild\u2019s leg or upper arm. The vaccine will never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. \n \nThe recommended dose is as follows: \n \nFirst course of vaccination (primary vaccination) \nYour child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months or three injections \ngiven at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used \naccording to the local vaccination programme. \n \nAdditional injections (booster) \nAfter the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local \nrecommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you \nwhen this dose should be given. \n \nIf you forget one dose of Hexyon \n \nIf your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse \nwho will decide when to give the missed dose. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nIt is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse that your child completes the course \nof injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) \n \nIf any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where your child received his/her injection, you \nmust consult a doctor IMMEDIATELY: \n\uf0b7 difficulty in breathing \n\uf0b7 blueness of the tongue or lips \n\uf0b7 a rash \n\uf0b7 swelling of the face or throat \n\uf0b7 sudden and serious malaise with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness and loss of \n\nconsciousness, accelerated heart rate associated with respiratory disorders \n \nWhen these signs or symptoms (signs or symptoms of anaphylactic reaction) occur they usually \ndevelop quickly after the injection is given and while the child is still in the clinic or doctor\u2019s surgery. \n \nSerious allergic reactions are a rare possibility (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) after receiving this \nvaccine. \n \nOther side effects \n \nIf your child experiences any of the following side effects, please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\uf0b7 Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are: \n\n- loss of appetite (anorexia) \n- crying \n- sleepiness (somnolence) \n- vomiting \n- pain, redness or swelling at the injection site \n- irritability \n- fever (temperature 38\u00b0C or higher) \n\n\uf0b7 Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are: \n- abnormal crying (prolonged crying) \n- diarrhoea \n- injection site hardness (induration) \n\n\uf0b7 Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are: \n- allergic reaction \n- a lump (nodule) at the injection site  \n- high fever (temperature 39.6\u00b0C or higher) \n\n\uf0b7 Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) are: \n- rash \n- large reactions at the injection site (larger than 5 cm), including extensive limb swelling from \nthe injection site beyond one or both joints. These reactions start within 24-72 hours after \nvaccination, may be associated with redness, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site, \nand get better within 3-5 days without the need for treatment. \n- fits (convulsions) with or without fever \n\n\uf0b7 Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) are: \n- episodes when your child goes into a shock-like state or is pale, floppy and unresponsive for a \nperiod of time (hypotonic reactions or hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes HHE). \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \nPotential side effects \n \nOther side effects not listed above have been reported occasionally with other diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib containing vaccines and not directly with Hexyon: \n\uf0b7 Temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders (Guillain-\n\nBarr\u00e9 syndrome) and severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder (brachial neuritis) \nhave been reported after administration of a tetanus containing vaccine. \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of several nerves causing sensory disorders or weakness of limbs \n(polyradiculoneuritis), facial paralysis, visual disturbances, sudden dimming or loss of vision \n(optic neuritis), inflammatory disease of brain and spinal cord (central nervous system \ndemyelination, multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis B \nantigen containing vaccine. \n\n\uf0b7 Swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy/encephalitis). \n\uf0b7 In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \n\nbetween breaths may occur for 2 - 3 days after vaccination. \n\uf0b7 Swelling of one or both feet and lower limbs which may occur along with bluish discoloration \n\nof the skin (cyanosis), redness, small areas of bleeding under the skin (transient purpura) and \nsevere crying following vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. If \nthis reaction occurs, it is mainly after first injections and within the first few hours following \nvaccination. All symptoms should disappear completely within 24 hours without need for \ntreatment. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Hexyon \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nKeep the vaccine in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

if there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. do not use hexyon if your child: has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration of hexyon. has had an allergic reaction - to the active substances, - to any of the excipients listed in section 6, - to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin b, as these substances are used during the manufacturing process. - after previous administration of hexyon or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis b or hib containing vaccines. suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system (uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold or flu). vaccination with hexyon may need to be delayed until your child is better. has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered: - fever of 40 or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable cause. - collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) within 48 hours of vaccination. - persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. - fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. previously had guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of 39 tetanus toxin). in this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be evaluated by your doctor. is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body's natural defenses) or has any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. in these cases the immune response to the vaccine may be decreased. it is normally recommended to wait until the end of the treatment or disease before vaccinating. however children with long standing problems with their immune system such as hiv infection (aids) may still be given hexyon but the protection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability of the kidneys to work properly). suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. your doctor will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor cuts. your doctor will advise you whether your child should have hexyon. other medicines or vaccines and hexyon tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines. hexyon can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles- mumps-rubella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines or meningococcal vaccines. when given at the same time with other vaccines, hexyon will be given at different injection sites. hexyon contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium hexyon contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. phenylalanine may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (pku), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. hexyon contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \"potassium-free\" and \"sodium-free\".", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "hexyon", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

vaccination (primary vaccination) your child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months or three injections given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). this vaccine should be used according to the local vaccination programme. additional injections (booster) after the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. your doctor will tell you when this dose should be given. if you forget one dose of hexyon if your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse who will decide when to give the missed dose. it is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the course of injections. if not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. if you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask

this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. serious allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) if any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where your child received his/her injection, you must consult a doctor immediately: difficulty in breathing blueness of the tongue or lips a rash swelling of the face or throat sudden and serious malaise with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness and loss of consciousness, accelerated heart rate associated with respiratory disorders when these signs or symptoms (signs or symptoms of anaphylactic reaction) occur they usually develop quickly after the injection is given and while the child is still in the clinic or doctor's surgery. serious allergic reactions are a rare possibility (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) after receiving this vaccine. other side effects if your child experiences any of the following side effects, please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are: - loss of appetite (anorexia) - crying - sleepiness (somnolence) - vomiting - pain, redness or swelling at the injection site - irritability - fever (temperature 38 or higher) common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) are: - abnormal crying (prolonged crying) - diarrhoea - injection site hardness (induration) uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) are: - allergic reaction - lump (nodule) at the injection site - high fever (temperature 39.6 or higher) rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) are: - rash - large reactions at the injection site (larger than 5 cm), including extensive limb swelling from the injection site beyond one or both joints. these reactions start within 24-72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with redness, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site, and get better within 3-5 days without the need for treatment. - fits (convulsions) with or without fever. very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) are: - episodes when your child goes into a shock-like state or is pale, floppy and unresponsive for a period of time (hypotonic reactions or hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes hhe). potential side effects 41 other side effects not listed above have been reported occasionally with other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis b or hib containing vaccines and not directly with hexyon: temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, paralysis and sensitivity disorders (guillain- barr\u00e9 syndrome) and severe pain and decreased mobility of arm and shoulder (brachial neuritis) have been reported after administration of a tetanus containing vaccine. inflammation of several nerves causing sensory disorders or weakness of limbs (polyradiculoneuritis), facial paralysis, visual disturbances, sudden dimming or loss of vision (optic neuritis), inflammatory disease of brain and spinal cord (central nervous system demyelination, multiple sclerosis) have been reported after administration of a hepatitis b antigen containing vaccine. swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalopathy/encephalitis). in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between breaths may occur for 2 - 3 days after vaccination. swelling of one or both feet and lower limbs which may occur along with bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), redness, small areas of bleeding under the skin (transient purpura) and severe crying following vaccination with haemophilus influenzae type b containing vaccines. if this reaction occurs, it is mainly after first injections and within the first few hours following vaccination. all symptoms should disappear completely within 24 hours without need for treatment. reporting of side effects if your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.",
