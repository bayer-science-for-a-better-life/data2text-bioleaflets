When reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections the \nsolution contains 500 IU/ml of rVIII-SingleChain.\n\n\n\n3\n\nAFSTYLA 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection\nEach vial contains nominally 3000 IU recombinant, single-chain coagulation factor VIII (rVIII-\nSingleChain, INN = lonoctocog alfa). When reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections the \nsolution contains 600 IU/ml of rVIII-SingleChain.\n\nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The \nspecific activity of AFSTYLA is 7400 - 16000 IU/mg protein.\n\nAFSTYLA is a single-chain recombinant human factor VIII produced in Chinese hamster ovary \n(CHO) cells. It is a construct where most of the B-domain occurring in wild-type, full-length \nfactor VIII and 4 amino acids of the adjacent acidic a3 domain were removed (amino acids 765 to \n1652 of full-length factor VIII).\n\nThe newly formed linkage of the heavy and light chain of factor VIII introduces a new N-\nglycosylation site. As the furin cleavage site present in wild type factor VIII between the B-\ndomain and the a3 domain was removed, AFSTYLA is expressed as a single-chain factor VIII \nmolecule.\n\nExcipient with known effect:\n\nAFSTYLA 250, 500 and 1000 IU (2.5 ml solvent)\nEach vial contains 17.5 mg (0.76 mmol) of sodium.\n\nAFSTYLA 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 IU (5 ml solvent)\nEach vial contains 35 mg (1.52 mmol) of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.\nWhite or slightly yellow powder or friable mass and clear, colourless solvent for solution for \ninjection.\n\npH: 6.6 - 7.3\n\nOsmolality: 500 - 600 mOsm/kg\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency).\n\nAFSTYLA can be used for all age groups.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.\n\nTreatment monitoring\nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide \nthe dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary \nin their responses to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on \n\n\n\n4\n\nbodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of \ncoagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.\n\nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for \ndetermining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can \nbe significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the \nassay. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based \none stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance \nparticularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.\n\nPlasma factor VIII activity in patients receiving AFSTYLA using either the chromogenic assay or \nthe one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency \nof repeat injections. The chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic \npotential of AFSTYLA and is preferred. The one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the \nfactor VIII activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. If the \none-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the \npatient’s factor VIII activity level.\n\nPosology\nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII \ndeficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n\nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which \nare related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity \nin plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in \nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).\n\nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in \none ml of normal human plasma.\n\nPotency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay.\nPlasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-\nstage clotting assay.\n\nOn demand treatment\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 \nInternational Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 \nIU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula:\n\nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired factor VIII rise (IU/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per \nIU/dl)\n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to \nthe clinical effectiveness in the individual case.\n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the \ngiven plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following \ntable can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:\nDegree of haemorrhage / \nType of surgical \nprocedure\n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dl)\n\nFrequency of doses (hours) / \nDuration of therapy (days)\n\nHaemorrhage\nEarly haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or oral \nbleeding\n\n20 - 40 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 \nhours. At least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode as indicated by \npain is resolved or healing is \n\n\n\n5\n\nachieved.\nMore extensive\nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma\n\n30 - 60 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 \nhours for 3-4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are \nresolved.\n\nLife threatening \nhaemorrhages\n\n60 - 100 Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.\n\nSurgery\nMinor surgery including \ntooth extraction\n\n30 - 60 Inject every 24 hours, at least 1 day, \nuntil healing is achieved.\n\nMajor surgery 80 - 100 \n(pre- and\npostoperative)\n\nRepeat injection every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \nmaintain a factor VIII activity of \n30% to 60% (IU/dl).\n\nProphylaxis \nThe recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times \nweekly. The regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.\n\nPaediatric population \nThe recommended starting regimen in children (0 to <12 years of age) is 30 to 50 IU per kg of \nAFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times weekly. More frequent or higher doses may be required in \nchildren <12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. \n\nFor adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for \nadults (please refer to section 5.2).\n\nElderly\nClinical studies of AFSTYLA did not include subjects over 65 years of age.\n\nMethod of administration\nIntravenous use. \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nThe reconstituted preparation should be injected slowly at a rate comfortable for the patient at a \nmaximum injection rate of 10 ml/min.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nKnown allergic reaction to hamster proteins.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHypersensitivity\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with AFSTYLA. The product contains traces of \nhamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use \nof the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the \nearly signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n\n\n\n6\n\nFor patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions appropriate pre-medication may be considered.\n\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n\nInhibitors\nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure \ndays but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. \n\nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \nposing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.\n\nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored \nfor the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the \nexpected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an \nappropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with \nhigh levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options \nshould be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with \nexperience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.\n\nMonitoring laboratory tests\nIf the one-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine \nthe patient’s factor VIII activity level (see section 4.2).\n\nCardiovascular events\nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase \nthe cardiovascular risk.\n\nCatheter-related complications\nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications \nincluding local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\nSodium content\nThis medicine contains up to 7 mg (0.3 mmol) sodium per ml after reconstitution. To be taken\ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII products with other medicinal products have \nbeen reported.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare \noccurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during \npregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during \npregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\n\n\n7\n\nAFSTYLA has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninjection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely with the use of factor VIII products and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis \n(including shock).\n\nDevelopment of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with AFSTYLA. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre be contacted.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). The frequencies in the table below were observed in completed clinical \nstudies in previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A.\n\nFrequencies have been evaluated on a per patient basis according to the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ Class\n\nAdverse reaction Frequency\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nFVIII inhibition\nuncommon (PTPs)*\n\nvery common \n(PUPs)*\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity common\nNervous system disorders Dizziness common\n\nParaesthesia common\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash common\nErythema uncommon\nPruritus uncommon\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nPyrexia common\nInjection site pain uncommon\nChills uncommon\nFeeling hot uncommon\n\n*Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients.\n\nPaediatric population \nNo age-specific differences in adverse reactions were observed between paediatric and adult \nsubjects. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nIn a completed clinical trial a patient who received more than double the prescribed dose of \nAFSTYLA experienced dizziness, feeling hot, and itching not considered related to AFSTYLA \nbut more plausibly attributed to co-administration of an analgesic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics: Blood coagulation factor VIII. \nATC code: B02BD02\n\nMechanism of Action \n\nAFSTYLA (INN: lonoctocog alfa) is a recombinant human protein that replaces the missing \ncoagulation factor VIII needed for effective hemostasis. AFSTYLA is a single polypeptide chain \nwith a truncated B-domain that allows for a covalent bridge to link the factor VIII heavy and light \nchains. AFSTYLA has demonstrated a higher VWF affinity relative to full-length rFVIII. VWF \nstabilizes factor VIII and protects it from degradation. Activated AFSTYLA has an amino acid \nsequence identical to endogenous FVIIIa.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac \npatient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor \nVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated \nfactor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts \nfibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.\nHaemophilia A is an x-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma \nlevels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nAdult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age\nStudy 1001 determined the efficacy and safety in the prevention of bleeding events in prophylaxis, \nhemostatic efficacy in the control of bleeding events and during perioperative management. The study \nenrolled 175 previously treated patients (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A (1 subject \n>60 years of age was enrolled) who accumulated a total of 14,306 EDs with rVIII-SingleChain. No \npatient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction. \n\nProphylaxis: 146 subjects were assigned to a prophylaxis regimen (median ABR, 1.14 (interquartile \nrange: 0.0, 4.2)), 79 (54%) were assigned a 3-times per week regimen and 47 (32%) a 2-times per \nweek regimen. Patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and \n30 IU/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens \nof 4,283 IU/kg year.\n\nTreatment of bleeding: Of the 848 bleeding events observed during Study 1001, 93.5% were \ncontrolled with 2 or fewer injections. The median dose to treat a bleeding episode was 34.7 IU/kg.\n\nPerioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): A total of 16 major surgical procedures were \nperformed and assessed in 13 subjects in Study 1001. Hemostatic efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in \nsurgical prophylaxis was rated as excellent or good in all surgeries. No paediatric subjects <18 years \nof age were included in the surgery population.\n\n\n\n9\n\nPaediatric population <12 years of age\nStudy 3002 enrolled a total of 84 previously treated patients <12 years of age (35 <6 years of age and \n49 6 to <12 years of age). The study participants accumulated a total of 5,239 EDs with rVIII-\nSingleChain. No patient developed an inhibitor or experienced an anaphylactic reaction.\n\nIndividualised prophylaxis: Of the 81 patients on prophylaxis (median ABR 3.69 (interquartile range: \n0.00, 7.20)), 43 (53%) were assigned to a 2-times weekly regimen and 25 (31%) to a 3-times per week \nregimen. Patients on prophylaxis 2- and 3-times per week were assigned median doses of 35 and 32\nIU/kg per injection respectively with a median annual consumption across all prophylaxis regimens of \n4,109 IU/kg year.\n\nTreatment of bleeding: Of the 347 bleeding events observed during Study 3002, 95.7%were controlled \nwith 2 or fewer injections. The median dose used to treat a bleeding event was 27.6 IU/kg \n\nOf note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and \nbetween different clinical studies.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAFSTYLA in the treatment of hereditary factor VIII deficiency in previously untreated paediatric \npatients (PUPs) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAdult population \nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of AFSTYLA was evaluated in 81 previously treated adult subjects \nwho had been diagnosed with severe haemophilia A with <1% factor VIII and with age from 18-\n60 years old, following an intravenous injection of 50 IU/kg. \nThe PK parameters were based on plasma factor VIII activity measured by the chromogenic \nsubstrate assay (for discrepancy in the factor VIII activity determined with one-stage clotting \nassay, please see section 4.2).The PK profile obtained 3 to 6 months after the initial PK \nassessment was comparable with the PK profile obtained after the first dose.\n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters following a Single Injection of 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA -\nChromogenic Substrate Assay:\n\nPK Parameters\n\nrVIII-SingleChain\n50 IU/kg\n(N=81)\n\nMean (CV%)\nMedian (Min,Max)\n\nIR (IU/dl)/(IU/kg)\n2.00 (20.8)\n\n1.99 (0.868, 2.90)\n\nCmax (IU/dl)\n106 (18.1)\n\n106 (62.4, 151)\n\nAUC0-inf (IU*h/dl)\n1960 (33.1)\n\n1910 (932, 4090)\n\nt1/2 (h)\n14.2 (26.0)\n\n13.7 (7.54, 23.9)\n\nMRT (h)\n20.4 (25.8)\n\n20.2 (10.8, 35.1)\n\nCL (ml/h/kg)\n2.90 (34.4)\n\n2.67 (1.26, 5.79)\n\nVss (ml/kg)\n55.2 (20.8)\n\n53.2 (32.4, 99.6)\nIR = incremental recovery recorded at 30 minutes after injection; Cmax = maximum concentration, AUC0-inf = area under \nthe factor VIII activity time curve extrapolated to infinity; t1/2 = half-life; MRT = mean residence time; CL = body \nweight adjusted clearance with N = 80; Vss = body weight adjusted volume of distribution at steady-state.

After \n\nfiltering/withdrawal (see below) the reconstituted product should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. \n\n- Do not use visibly cloudy solutions or solutions still containing flakes or particles. \n- Reconstitution and withdrawal must be carried out under aseptic conditions.\n\nReconstitution and administration\nBring the solvent to room temperature. Ensure powder and solvent vial flip caps are removed and \nthe stoppers are treated with an antiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the \nMix2Vial package.\n\n1\n\n1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not remove \nthe Mix2Vial from the blister package!\n\n\n\n13\n\n2\n\n2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold \nthe vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister \npackage and push the spike of the blue adapter end \nstraight down through the solvent vial stopper.\n\n3\n\n3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial \nset by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards.\nMake sure that you only pull away the blister package and \nnot the Mix2Vial set.\n\n4\n\n4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. Invert \nthe solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push \nthe spike of the transparent adapter end straight down\nthrough the powder vial stopper. The solvent will \nautomatically flow into the powder vial.\n\n5\n\n5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set \nand with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and \nunscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two \npieces.\nDiscard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter \nattached.\n\n6\n\n6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter \nattached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not \nshake.\n\n7\n\n7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product \nvial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial's Luer \nLock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the \nproduct vial.\n\nWithdrawal and administration\n\n\n\n14\n\n8\n\n8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the \nsystem upside down and draw the solution into the syringe \nby pulling the plunger back slowly.\n\n9\n\n9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the \nsyringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe \n(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect \nthe transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by \nunscrewing counterclockwise.\n\nFor injection of AFSTYLA the provided administration sets are recommended to be used because \ntreatment failure can occur as a consequence of factor VIII adsorption to the internal surface of \nsome injection equipment.\n\nCare should be taken that no blood enters the syringe filled with product, as there is a risk that the \nblood could coagulate in the syringe and fibrin clots could therefore be administered to the \npatient. \n\nThe AFSTYLA solution must not be diluted.\n\nThe reconstituted solution should be administered by a separate injection/infusion line by slow \nintravenous injection, at a rate comfortable to the patient, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4\nfor how to report side effects. \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n If you have further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What AFSTYLA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use AFSTYLA\n3. How to use AFSTYLA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store AFSTYLA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What AFSTYLA is and what it is used for \n\nAFSTYLA is a human clotting (coagulation) factor VIII product that is produced by recombinant \nDNA technology. The active substance in AFSTYLA is lonoctocog alfa.\n\nAFSTYLA is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor \nVIII deficiency). Factor VIII is involved in blood clotting. Lack of this factor means that blood does \nnot clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. AFSTYLA works by \nreplacing the missing factor VIII in haemophilia A patients to enable their blood to clot normally.\n\nAFSTYLA can be used for all age groups.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use AFSTYLA\n\nDo not use AFSTYLA\n if you have had an allergic reaction to AFSTYLA, or any of its ingredients (listed in section 6).\n if you are allergic to hamster proteins.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTraceability\n\n\n\n46\n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time AFSTYLA is given, you record the date of administration, \nthe batch number and the injected volume in your treatment diary.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using AFSTYLA.\n\n Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contain traces of hamster proteins \n(see also “Do not use AFSTYLA”). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, stop using the \nmedicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should inform you of the early \nsigns of allergic reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that causes severe \ndifficulty in breathing, and dizziness). \n\n The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during \ntreatment with all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the \ntreatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the \ndevelopment of these inhibitors. If you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with \nAFSTYLA, tell your doctor immediately.\n\n If you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell your doctor or \npharmacist.\n\n If you need a central venous access device (CVAD for injection of AFSTYLA), the risk of \ncomplications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of \na blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted should be considered \nby your doctor.\n\nOther medicines and AFSTYLA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n During pregnancy and breast-feeding, AFSTYLA should be given only if it is clearly needed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nAFSTYLA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nAFSTYLA contains sodium\nAFSTYLA contains up to 7 mg (0.3 mmol) sodium per ml after reconstitution.\nHowever depending on your body weight and your dose of AFSTYLA, you could receive more than \none vial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n3. How to use AFSTYLA\n\nYour treatment should be monitored by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of blood clotting\ndisorders.\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure.\n\nDose\nThe amount of AFSTYLA you need to take and the duration of treatment depend on:\n the severity of your disease\n the site and intensity of the bleeding\n your clinical condition and response\n your body weight\n\nFollow the directions given to you by your doctor.\n\n\n\n47\n\nReconstitution and administration\n\nGeneral Instructions\n The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic \n\nconditions.\n AFSTYLA must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6.\n The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e., it might be \n\nsparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or \nwithdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. Do not use the \nsolution if it is visibly cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.\n\n Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements and as instructed by your doctor. \n\nReconstitution and administration\nWithout opening the vials, warm the AFSTYLA powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. \nThis can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them \nin your hands for a few minutes. \nDo not expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 °C).\n\nCarefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an \nalcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter \ntransfer device), then follow the instructions given below.\n\n1\n\n1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not remove \nthe Mix2Vial from the blister package!\n\n2\n\n2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold \nthe vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister \npackage and push the spike of the blue adapter end \nstraight down through the solvent vial stopper.\n\n3\n\n3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial \nset by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. \nMake sure that you only pull away the blister package and \nnot the Mix2Vial set.\n\n4\n\n4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. Invert \nthe solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push \nthe spike of the transparent adapter end straight down\nthrough the powder vial stopper. The solvent will \nautomatically flow into the powder vial.\n\n\n\n48\n\n5\n\n5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set \nand with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and \nunscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two \npieces.\nDiscard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter \nattached.\n\n6\n\n6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter \nattached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not \nshake.\n\n7\n\n7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product \nvial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial's Luer \nLock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the \nproduct vial.\n\nWithdrawal and administration\n\n8\n\n8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the \nsystem upside down and draw the solution into the syringe \nby pulling the plunger back slowly.\n\n9\n\n9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the \nsyringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe \n(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect \nthe transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by \nunscrewing counterclockwise.\n\nUse the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back \nto the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. Inject\nthe reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min) into \nthe vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care not to get any blood in the \nsyringe containing the product.\n\nCheck yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that \nmight be related to the administration of AFSTYLA, the injection should be stopped (see also section \n2).\n\n\n\n49\n\nUse in children and adolescents\nAFSTYLA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher \ndoses or more frequent injections may be needed. Children above 12 years of age can use the same \ndose as adults.\n\nIf you use more AFSTYLA than you should\nIf you have injected more AFSTYLA than you should, please inform your doctor.\n\nIf you forget to use AFSTYLA\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately \nand continue as advised by your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you stop using AFSTYLA\nIf you stop using AFSTYLA you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may \nnot stop. Do not stop using AFSTYLA without consulting your doctor.\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, AFSTYLA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nPlease stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor if:\n you notice symptoms of allergic reactions \n\nAllergic reactions may include the following symptoms: hives, generalised urticaria (itchy rash), \ntightness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, low blood pressure, dizziness, and \nanaphylaxis. If this happens, you should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your\ndoctor.\n\n you notice that the medicine stops working properly (bleeding is not stopped)\nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section \n2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however patients who have received \nprevious treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon \n(less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens you or your child´s medicines may stop working \nproperly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should \ncontact your doctor immediately.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 users)\n allergic reaction\n dizziness\n tingling or numbness (paraesthesia)\n rash\n fever\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 users)\n itching\n redness of the skin\n pain at the injection site \n chills\n feeling hot\n\nSide effects in children and adolescents\nNo age-specific differences in adverse reactions were observed between children, adolescents and \nadult subjects.\n\n\n\n50\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Individual patients may vary \nin their responses to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on \nbodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major \nsurgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of \ncoagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.\n\nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for \ndetermining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can \nbe significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the \nassay. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based \none stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance \nparticularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.\n\nPlasma factor VIII activity in patients receiving AFSTYLA using either the chromogenic assay or \nthe one-stage clotting assay should be monitored to guide the dose administered and the frequency \nof repeat injections. The chromogenic assay result most accurately reflects the clinical hemostatic \npotential of AFSTYLA and is preferred. The one-stage clotting assay result underestimates the \nfactor VIII activity level compared to the chromogenic assay result by approximately 45%. If the \none-stage clotting assay is used, multiply the result by a conversion factor of 2 to determine the \npatient’s factor VIII activity level. \n\nPosology\nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII \ndeficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n\nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which \nare related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity \nin plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in preferably \nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).\n\nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in \none ml of normal human plasma.\n\nPotency assignment is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay.\nPlasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic substrate assay or a one-stage \nclotting assay.\n\nOn demand treatment\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 \nInternational Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 \nIU/dl. The required dose is determined using the following formula:\n\nDose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired factor VIII rise (IU/dl or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg per \nIU/dl)\n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to \nthe clinical effectiveness in the individual case.\n\n\n\n54\n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the \ngiven plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following \ntable can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:\n\nDegree of haemorrhage / \nType of surgical \nprocedure\n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dl)\n\nFrequency of doses (hours) / \nDuration of therapy (days)\n\nHaemorrhage\nEarly haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or oral \nbleeding\n\n20 - 40 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 \nhours. At least 1 day, until the \nbleeding episode as indicated by \npain is resolved or healing is \nachieved.\n\nMore extensive\nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma\n\n30 - 60 Repeat injection every 12 to 24 \nhours for 3-4 days or more until \npain and acute disability are \nresolved.\n\nLife threatening \nhaemorrhages\n\n60 - 100 Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.\n\nSurgery\nMinor surgery including \ntooth extraction\n\n30 - 60 Inject every 24 hours, at least 1 day, \nuntil healing is achieved.\n\nMajor surgery 80 - 100 \n(pre- and\npostoperative)\n\nRepeat injection every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days to \nmaintain a factor VIII activity of \n30% to 60% (IU/dl).\n\nProphylaxis\nThe recommended starting regimen is 20 to 50 IU/kg of AFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times \nweekly. The regimen may be adjusted based on patient response.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe recommended starting regimen in children (0 to <12 years of age) is 30 to 50 IU per kg of \nAFSTYLA administered 2 to 3 times weekly. More frequent or higher doses may be required in \nchildren <12 years of age to account for the higher clearance in this age group. \nFor adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose recommendations are the same as for \nadults.\n\nElderly\nClinical studies of AFSTYLA did not include subjects over 65 years of age.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
