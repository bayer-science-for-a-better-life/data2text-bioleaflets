This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVeltassa 8.4 g powder for oral suspension \nVeltassa 16.8 g powder for oral suspension \nVeltassa 25.2 g powder for oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sachet contains 8.4 g patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium) \nEach sachet contains 16.8 g patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium) \nEach sachet contains 25.2 g patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for oral suspension. \nOff white to light brown powder, with occasional white particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVeltassa is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 8.4 g patiromer once daily. \n \nThe daily dose may be adjusted in intervals of one week or longer, based on the serum potassium level \nand the desired target range. The daily dose may be increased or decreased by 8.4 g as necessary to \nreach the desired target range, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. If serum potassium falls below \nthe desired range, the dose should be reduced or discontinued. \n \nIf a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. The missed \ndose should not be taken with the next dose. \n \nAdministration of Veltassa should be separated by 3 hours from other oral medicinal products (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nThe onset of action of Veltassa occurs 4 – 7 hours after administration. It should not replace \nemergency treatment for life threatening hyperkalaemia. \n \nPatients on dialysis \n \nThere is limited data on the use of Veltassa in patients on dialysis. No special dose and administration \nguidelines were applied to these patients in clinical studies. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nElderly population (≥65 years of age) \n \nNo special dose and administration guidelines are recommended for this population. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Veltassa in children aged under 18 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nVeltassa should be mixed with water and stirred to a suspension of uniform consistency, according to \nthe following steps: \n \nThe complete dose should be poured into a glass containing approximately 40 mL of water, then \nstirred. Another approximately 40 mL of water should be added, and the suspension stirred again \nthoroughly. The powder will not dissolve. More water may be added to the mixture as needed for \ndesired consistency. \n \nThe mixture should be taken within 1 hour of initial suspension. If powder remains in the glass after \ndrinking, more water should be added and the suspension stirred and taken immediately. This may be \nrepeated as needed to ensure the entire dose is administered. \n \nApple juice or cranberry juice can be used instead of water to prepare the mixture. Other liquids \nshould be avoided as they may contain high amounts of potassium. \nIn general, cranberry juice intake should be limited to moderate amounts (for example less than \n400 mL per day) due to its potential interaction with other medicinal products. \n \nVeltassa can be taken with or without food. It should not be heated (e.g. microwaved) or added to \nheated foods or liquids. It should not be taken in its dry form. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLow Magnesium \n \nIn clinical studies, serum magnesium values <1.4 mg/dL (0.58 mmol/L) occurred in 9% of patients \ntreated with patiromer. Mean decreases in serum magnesium were 0.17 mg/dL (0.070 mmol/L) or less. \nSerum magnesium should be monitored for at least 1 month after initiating treatment, and magnesium \nsupplementation considered in patients who develop low serum magnesium levels. \n \nGastrointestinal Disorders \n \nPatients with a history of bowel obstruction or major gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal \ndisorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in the clinical studies. Gastrointestinal ischaemia, \nnecrosis and/or intestinal perforation have been reported with other potassium binders. The benefits \nand risks of administering patiromer should be carefully evaluated in patients with current or history of \nsevere gastrointestinal disorders, before and during treatment. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDiscontinuing patiromer \n \nWhen discontinuing patiromer, serum potassium levels may rise, especially if RAAS inhibitor \ntreatment is continued. Patients should be instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting \ntheir physicians. Increases in serum potassium may occur as early as 2 days after the last patiromer \ndose. \n \nSerum potassium levels \n \nSerum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated, including after changes are made to \nmedicinal products that affect the serum potassium concentration (e.g. RAAS inhibitors or diuretics) \nand after the patiromer dose is titrated. \n \nInformation about sorbitol \n \nVeltassa contains sorbitol as part of the counterion complex. The sorbitol content is approximately 4 g \n(10.4 kcal) per 8.4 g of patiromer. \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. \n \nInformation about calcium \n \nVeltassa contains calcium as part of the counterion complex. Calcium is partially released some of \nwhich may be absorbed (see section 5.1). The benefits and risks of administering this medicinal \nproduct should be carefully evaluated in patients at risk of hypercalcaemia. \n \nLimitations of the clinical data \n \nPatients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \n \nPatiromer has been studied only in a limited number of patients with estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m² and patients receiving dialysis treatment. \n \nSevere hyperkalaemia \n \nThere is limited experience in patients with serum potassium concentrations greater than 6.5 mmol/L. \n \nLong term exposure \n \nClinical trials with patiromer have not included exposure longer than one year. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of patiromer on other medicinal products \n \nPatiromer has the potential to bind some oral co administered medicinal products, which could \ndecrease their gastrointestinal absorption. As patiromer is not absorbed or metabolised by the body, \nthere are limited effects on the function of other medicinal products. \n \nAs precautionary measure, and based on the data summarised below, administration of patiromer \nshould therefore be separated by at least 3 hours from other oral medicinal products. \n \nConcomitant administration of patiromer showed reduced bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, \nlevothyroxine and metformin. However, there was no interaction when patiromer and these medicinal \nproducts were taken 3 hours apart. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown potential interaction of patiromer with quinidine. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nConcomitant administration of patiromer did however not affect the bioavailability as measured by the \narea under the curve (AUC) of amlodipine, cinacalcet, clopidogrel, furosemide, lithium, metoprolol, \ntrimethoprim, verapamil and warfarin. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown no potential interaction of patiromer with the following active substances: \nallopurinol, amoxicillin, apixaban, acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin, cephalexin, digoxin, glipizide, \nlisinopril, phenytoin, riboflavin, rivaroxaban, spironolactone and valsartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of patiromer in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of patiromer during pregnancy. \n \nBreast feeding \n \nNo effects on the breast fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-\nfeeding woman to patiromer is negligible. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast \nfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from patiromer therapy taking into account the benefit of breast \nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effect of patiromer on fertility in humans. Animal studies showed no effects \non reproductive function or fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatiromer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe majority of the adverse reactions (ARs) reported from trials were gastrointestinal disorders, with \nthe most frequently reported ARs being constipation (6.2%), diarrhoea (3%), abdominal pain (2.9%), \nflatulence (1.8%) and hypomagnesaemia (5.3%). Gastrointestinal disorder reactions were generally \nmild to moderate in nature, did not appear to be dose related, generally resolved spontaneously or with \ntreatment, and none were reported as serious. Hypomagnesaemia was mild to moderate, with no \npatient developing a serum magnesium level <1 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ Class \n \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypomagnesaemia  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain \nFlatulence \n\nNausea \nVomiting \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSince excessive doses of Veltassa may result in hypokalaemia, serum potassium levels should be \nmonitored. Patiromer is excreted after approximately 24 to 48 hours, based on average gastrointestinal \ntransit time. If it is determined that medical intervention is required, appropriate measures to restore \nserum potassium may be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and hyperphosphataemia. ATC \ncode: V03AE09 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPatiromer is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a calcium-sorbitol complex as a \ncounterion. \n \nPatiromer increases faecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the \ngastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the \ngastrointestinal lumen, resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn healthy adult subjects, patiromer caused a dose dependent increase in faecal potassium excretion, \nand a corresponding decrease in urinary potassium excretion with no change in serum potassium. \n25.2 g of patiromer, administered once daily for 6 days, resulted in a mean increase in faecal \npotassium excretion of 1283 mg/day, and a mean decrease in urinary potassium excretion of \n1438 mg/day. Daily urinary calcium excretion increased from baseline by 53 mg/day. \n \nIn an open label study to assess the time to onset of action, a statistically significant reduction in serum \npotassium in hyperkalaemic patients was observed at 7 hours after the first dose. Following \ndiscontinuation of patiromer, potassium levels remained stable for 24 hours after the last dose, then \nrose again during a 4-day observation period. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of patiromer were demonstrated in a two-part, single blind randomised \nwithdrawal study that evaluated this treatment in hyperkalaemic patients with chronic kidney disease \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n(CKD) on stable doses of at least one RAAS inhibitor (i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor \n[ACEI], angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] or aldosterone antagonist [AA]). \n \nIn Part A, 243 patients were treated with patiromer for 4 weeks. Patients with a baseline serum \npotassium of 5.1 mEq/L to <5.5 mEq/L (mmol/L) received a starting dose of 8.4 g patiromer per day \n(as a divided dose) and patients with a baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L received \na starting dose of 16.8 g patiromer per day (as a divided dose). The dose was titrated, as needed, based \non the serum potassium level, assessed starting on Day 3 and then at weekly visits to the end of the \n4 week treatment period, with the aim of maintaining serum potassium in the target range (3.8 mEq/L \nto <5.1 mEq/L). The mean daily doses of patiromer were 13 g and 21 g in patients with serum \npotassium of 5.1 to <5.5 mEq/L and 5.5 to <6.5 mEq/L, respectively. \n \nThe mean age of patients was 64 years (54% aged 65 and over, 17% aged 75 and over), 58% of \npatients were men, and 98% were Caucasian. Approximately 97% of patients had hypertension, 57% \nhad type 2 diabetes, and 42% had heart failure. \n \nMean serum potassium levels and change in serum potassium from Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4 \nis shown in Table 1. For the Part A secondary outcome, 76% (95% CI: 70%, 81%) of patients had a \nserum potassium in the target range of 3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L at Part A Week 4. \n \nTable 1: Patiromer treatment phase (Part A): Primary endpoint \n Baseline Potassium Overall Population \n\n(n=237) 5.1 to <5.5 mEq/L \n(n=90) \n\n5.5 to <6.5 mEq/L \n(n=147) \n\nSerum Potassium (mEq/L) \nBaseline, mean (SD) 5.31 (0.57) 5.74 (0.40) 5.58 (0.51) \nWeek 4 Change from \nBaseline, Mean ± SE \n(95% CI) \n\n−0.65 ± 0.05 \n \n\n(−0.74, −0.55) \n\n−1.23 ± 0.04 \n \n\n(−1.31, −1.16) \n\n−1.01 ± 0.03 \n \n\n(−1.07, −0.95) \np value   <0.001 \n \nIn Part B, 107 patients with a Part A baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L and whose \nserum potassium was in the target range (3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L) at Part A Week 4 and still \nreceiving RAAS inhibitor treatment were randomised to continue patiromer or to receive placebo for \n8 weeks to evaluate the effect of withdrawing patiromer on serum potassium. In patients randomised to \npatiromer, the mean daily dose was 21 g at the start of Part B and during Part B. \n \nThe Part B primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the earliest \nvisit at which the patient’s serum potassium was first outside of the range of 3.8 to <5.5 mEq/L or to \nPart B Week 4 if the patient’s serum potassium remained in the range. In Part B, serum potassium in \npatients on placebo increased significantly relative to patients who remained on patiromer (p<0.001). \n \nMore placebo patients (91% [95% CI: 83%, 99%]) developed a serum potassium ≥5.1 mEq/L at any \ntime during Part B than patiromer patients (43% [95% CI: 30%, 56%]), p<0.001. More placebo \npatients (60% [95% CI: 47%, 74%]) developed a serum potassium ≥5.5 mEq/L at any time during \nPart B than patiromer patients (15% [95% CI: 6%, 24%]), p<0.001. \n \nThe potential of patiromer to enable concomitant RAAS inhibitor treatment was also assessed in part B. \nFifty two percent (52%) of subjects receiving placebo discontinued RAAS inhibitor treatment because \nof recurrent hyperkalaemia compared with 5% of subjects treated with patiromer. \n \nThe effect of treatment with patiromer for up to 52 weeks was evaluated in an open label study of 304 \nhyperkalaemic patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable doses of a RAAS inhibitor. \nThe mean age of patients was 66 years (59.9% aged 65 and over, 19.7% aged 75 and over), 63% of \npatients were men, and all were Caucasian. Decreases in serum potassium with patiromer treatment \nwere maintained over 1 year of chronic treatment as shown in Figure 1, with a low incidence of \n\n\n\n8 \n\nhypokalaemia (2.3%) and the majority of subjects reaching (97.7%) and maintaining target serum \npotassium levels (overall during maintenance period, serum potassium was within the target range for \napproximately 80% of the time). In patients with a baseline serum potassium of >5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L \nwho received an initial dose of 8.4 g patiromer per day, the mean daily dose was 14 g; in those with a \nbaseline serum potassium of >5.5 to <6.0 mEq/L who received an initial dose of 16.8 g patiromer per \nday, the mean daily dose was 20 g during the entire study. \n \n \nFigure 1: Mean (95% CI) serum potassium over time \n   Baseline Serum K+ > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L \n\nM\nea\n\nn \n(9\n\n5%\n C\n\nl) \nS\n\ner\num\n\n P\not\n\nas\nsi\n\num\n (m\n\nE\nq/\n\nL)\n \n\n  Baseline Serum K+ > 5.5 to < 6.0 mEq/L \n\n \n  Study Visit (week) Follow-Up (day) \n\nNumber of Subjects: \nLower K+ Stratum: 218 199 192 175 168 161 161 163 158 156 151 148 149 145 131 126 \nHigher K+ Stratum: 83 73 70 65 62 62 62 61 53 53 53 52 49 49 48 47 \n\n \nThe ability of patiromer to enable concomitant spironolactone treatment was investigated in a \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in heart failure patients who were clinically \nindicated to receive AA. Patients initiated spironolactone at 25 mg/day at the same time as their \nrandomised treatment (patiromer 12.6 g BID or placebo), and were up-titrated to 50 mg/day after \nDay 14 if serum potassium was >3.5 and ≤5.1 mEq/L. Of the 105 patients who were randomised and \nreceived study treatment (patiromer 56; placebo 49), mean age was 68.3 years, 60.6% were men, \n97.1% were Caucasian, and mean eGFR was 81.3 mL/min. Mean baseline serum potassium values \nwere 4.71 mEq/L for patiromer and 4.68 mEq/L for placebo. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in serum potassium to the end of the 28-day \ntreatment period, was significantly lower (p<0.001) in the patiromer group (LS mean [SEM]: −0. 21 \n[0.07] mEq/L) as compared to the placebo group (LS mean [SEM]: +0.23 [0.07] mEq/L). There were \nalso fewer patients in the patiromer group with serum potassium values >5.5 mEq/L (7.3% vs. 24.5%; \np=0.027) and more patients on spironolactone 50 mg/day (90.9% versus 73.5%, p=0.022). \n \nOverall, in the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, 99.4% of patients were receiving RAAS inhibitor therapy \nat baseline, 81.2% had CKD with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 72.8% had diabetes mellitus and 48.7% \nhad heart failure. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \npatiromer in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of hyperkalaemia (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nEffect of Food \n \nIn an open-label study, 114 patients with hyperkalaemia were randomized to patiromer once daily \nwith food or without food. Serum potassium at the end of treatment, the change from baseline in serum \npotassium, and the mean dose of patiromer were similar between groups. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPatiromer works by binding potassium in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the serum concentration is \nnot relevant for its efficacy. Due to the insolubility and nonabsorptive characteristics of this medicinal \nproduct, many classical pharmacokinetic studies cannot be carried out. \n \nPatiromer is excreted approximately 24 to 48 hours after intake, based on average gastrointestinal \ntransit time. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn radiolabeled studies in rats and dogs, patiromer was not systemically absorbed and was excreted in \nthe faeces. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography analysis in rats demonstrated that radioactivity \nwas limited to the gastrointestinal tract, with no detectable level of radioactivity in any other tissues or \norgans. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nPatiromer was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation test (Ames assay), chromosome aberration or rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

What Veltassa is and what it is used for \n \nVeltassa is a medicine that contains the active substance patiromer. \n \nVeltassa is used to treat adults with high levels of potassium in their blood. \n \nToo much potassium in the blood can affect how your nerves control your muscles. This can lead to \nweakness or even paralysis. High potassium levels can also result in an abnormal heartbeat, which can \ncause serious effects on your heart rhythm. \n \nVeltassa works by attaching to potassium in your gut. This prevents potassium from entering your \nbloodstream and lowers potassium levels in your blood back to normal. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Veltassa \n \nDo not take Veltassa \n \n• if you are allergic to patiromer or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Veltassa if you have: \n• problems swallowing \n• severe stomach or bowel problems \n• had major surgery on your stomach or bowel. \n \nLow blood magnesium can occur when taking Veltassa. Your doctor will check the magnesium level \nduring treatment with Veltassa for at least 1 month and may prescribe a magnesium supplement if \nrequired. \n \nVeltassa contains sorbitol. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. The sorbitol content is approximately \n4 g (10.4 kcal) per 8.4 g of patiromer. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give Veltassa to children under 18 years, as it has not been studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Veltassa \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nVeltassa may affect certain medicines if they are taken by mouth and at the same time, such as: \n• ciprofloxacin: a medicine to treat bacterial infections \n• levothyroxine: a medicine to treat thyroid hormone deficiency \n• metformin: a medicine to treat diabetes \n• quinidine: a medicine to treat irregular heart rhythm. \n \nTake all medicines taken by mouth at least 3 hours before or after you take Veltassa, unless your \ndoctor or pharmacist gives you different advice. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nPregnancy and breast feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nUse Veltassa during pregnancy and breast feeding only if your doctor considers it necessary. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVeltassa has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Veltassa \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• starting dose: 8.4 g patiromer (the content of one 8.4 g sachet) once daily \n• maximum dose: 25.2 g patiromer (the content of one 25.2 g sachet) once daily \n \nYour doctor may adjust the dose depending on the potassium level in your blood. \nTake Veltassa at least 3 hours before or after other medicines taken by mouth unless your doctor or \npharmacist gives you different advice. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nMix Veltassa with water and stir until it is thoroughly mixed, as follows: \n• Prepare about 40 mL (3 tablespoons) of water in a glass. \n• Add the required number of Veltassa sachets and stir. \n• Add about 40 mL (3 tablespoons) of additional water and stir thoroughly. The powder does not \n\ndissolve but forms a suspension, which might feel grainy. \n• You may add more water to the mixture to help you swallow the medicine. \n• Drink the mixture within 1 hour after preparation. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, \n\nadd more water, stir and drink immediately. You may need to do this again to make sure that \nyou have taken all the powder. \n\n \nYou can use apple juice or cranberry juice instead of water. Other liquids cannot be used as they may \ncontain high amounts of potassium. You should drink only moderate amounts (less than 400 mL per \nday) of cranberry juice as it can affect other medicines. \n \nTake the prepared Veltassa suspension with or without food, preferably at the same time each day. \nNever heat Veltassa or add it to heated foods or liquids. \nDo not take Veltassa as a dry powder. \n \nIf you take more Veltassa than you should \n \nStop taking Veltassa and talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Veltassa \n \nIf you have missed a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day. Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. If you miss more than one dose, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Veltassa \n \nDo not stop taking the medicine without your doctor’s approval, as your potassium blood level may \nincrease. \n \n \n4.
