NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTybost 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of cobicistat. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 59 micrograms sunset yellow FCF aluminium lake (E110). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nOrange, round, biconvex, film-coated tablet of diameter 10.3 mm, debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on one side of \nthe tablet and plain-faced on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTybost is indicated as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of atazanavir 300 mg once daily or darunavir \n800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral combination therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-1 \n(HIV-1) infected adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older: \n\u2022 weighing at least 35 kg co-administered with atazanavir or \n\u2022 weighing at least 40 kg co-administered with darunavir. \nSee sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nTybost is used in combination with atazanavir or darunavir, therefore the atazanavir or darunavir \nSummary of Product Characteristics should be consulted. \n \nTybost must be taken orally, once daily with food. \n \nThe doses of Tybost and the co-administered protease inhibitor, atazanavir or darunavir, are presented \nin Tables 1 and 2. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Dosing regimens in adults \n \nDose of Tybost Dose of HIV-1 protease inhibitor \n\n150 mg once daily \nAtazanavir 300 mg once daily \nDarunavir 800 mg once daily \n\n \nTable 2: Dosing regimens in adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing \u2265 35 kg \n \nBody Weight (kg) Dose of Tybost Dose of HIV-1 protease inhibitor \n\n\u2265 40 150 mg once daily \nAtazanavir 300 mg once daily \nDarunavir 800 mg once daily \n\n35 to < 40 150 mg once daily Atazanavir 300 mg once daily \n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Tybost within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Tybost with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule in combination \nwith atazanavir or darunavir.  If a patient misses a dose of Tybost by more than 12 hours, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of cobicistat is required for patients with renal impairment, including those with \nsevere renal impairment.  Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, \nno recommendation can be made for these patients. \n \nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine.  Cobicistat should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than \n70 ml/min if any co-administered agent (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil, or \nadefovir) requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.  See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of cobicistat is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B).  Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  Therefore, the use of Tybost is not recommended in these \npatients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of cobicistat co-administered with atazanavir in children aged 0 to less than \n12 years, or weighing less than 35 kg have not been established.  The safety and efficacy of cobicistat \nco-administered with darunavir in children aged 0 to less than 12 years, or weighing less than 40 kg \nhave not been established.  No data are available. \n \nPregnancy \nTreatment with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir during pregnancy results in lower atazanavir or \ndarunavir exposure.  Therefore, therapy with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir should not be \ninitiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with cobicistat and \natazanavir or darunavir should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  \nDarunavir/ritonavir may be considered as an alternative regimen. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nTybost should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for \nclearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or \nlife-threatening events.  Therefore, Tybost should not be co-administered with medicinal products that \ninclude, but are not limited to, the following (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): \n \n\u2022 alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists: alfuzosin \n\u2022 antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine \n\u2022 ergot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine \n\u2022 HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin \n\u2022 neuroleptics/antipsychotics: pimozide, lurasidone \n\u2022 PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \n\u2022 sedatives/hypnotics: orally administered midazolam, triazolam \n \nCo-administration is contraindicated with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A due \nto the potential for loss of therapeutic effect.  Therefore, Tybost should not be co-administered with \nmedicinal products that include, but are not limited to, the following (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): \n \n\u2022 anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n\u2022 antimycobacterials: rifampicin \n\u2022 herbal products: St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \nCo-administration with dabigatran etexilate, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nCobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate. \n \nIncreased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including \natazanavir and darunavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat.  Higher plasma \nconcentrations of co-administered medicinal products can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic \neffects or adverse reactions.  For medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A these higher plasma \nconcentrations may potentially lead to serious and/or life-threatening events (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that induce CYP3A is contraindicated or is \nnot recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5) because decreased plasma concentrations of cobicistat \ncould result in plasma levels that are insufficient to achieve adequate pharmacoenhancement of \natazanavir or darunavir. \n \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the \nclearance of cobicistat, resulting in increased cobicistat plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nCobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6.  \nCo-administration with cobicistat can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nCobicistat inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  \nCo-administration of cobicistat in patients receiving medicinal products that are substrates of these \ntransporters may result in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products \n(see section 4.5). \n \nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1.  If switching pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required during the \nfirst two weeks of treatment with cobicistat, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered \nmedicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nContraception requirements \nPlasma concentrations of ethinyloestradiol are decreased following co-administration of \ndrospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with darunavir/cobicistat.  Alternative or additional contraceptive \nmeasures are recommended when oestrogen-based contraceptives are co-administered with \ndarunavir/cobicistat. \n \nPlasma concentrations of drospirenone are increased following administration of \ndrospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with atazanavir/cobicistat or with darunavir/cobicistat.  If \ndrospirenone/ethinyloestradiol is co-administered with atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat \nclinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalemia. \n \nData are not available to make recommendations on the use of atazanavir/cobicistat or \ndarunavir/cobicistat with other oral contraceptives.  Alternative forms of contraception should be \nconsidered (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of Tybost and antiretroviral medicinal products \nTybost must be co-administered with either atazanavir 300 mg once daily or with darunavir 800 mg \nonce daily (see section 4.2).  Safety and efficacy have not been established for use of cobicistat with \neither atazanavir or darunavir when used in any other dosing regimen.  Antiviral efficacy data from \nrandomised controlled studies is available for cobicistat-boosted atazanavir, but not for \ncobicistat-boosted darunavir (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nTybost must not be used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of any other HIV-1 protease inhibitor or any \nother antiretroviral medicinal product that requires boosting since dosing recommendations for such \nco-administration have not been established and may result in insufficient plasma level of the \nantiretroviral medicinal product(s) leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance \n(see section 4.2). \n \nCobicistat co-administered with atazanavir or darunavir should not be used in combination with \nanother antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with \nan inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another protease \ninhibitor).  Dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and \nco-administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir, darunavir and/or the \nother antiretroviral agents that require pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of antiviral activity and \ndevelopment of resistance. \n \nTybost should not be used in combination with other medicinal products containing cobicistat or with \nritonavir due to similar effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A. \n \nEffects on estimated creatinine clearance \n \nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine.  This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated creatine \nclearance, should be taken into consideration when cobicistat is administered to patients in whom the \n\n\n\n6 \n\nestimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical management, including \nadjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. \n \nTybost should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if one or more \nco-administered agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (e.g. emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir).  See sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2. \n \nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat. \n \nLiver disease \n \nCobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).  \nTherefore, the use of Tybost is not recommended in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nTreatment with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir during the second and third trimesters of \npregnancy has been shown to result in lower atazanavir or darunavir exposure compared to \npostpartum.  Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting.  The substantial \nreduction in atazanavir or darunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.  Therefore, therapy with cobicistat and atazanavir or \ndarunavir should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy \nwith cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir should be switched to an alternative regimen (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.6).  Darunavir given with low dose ritonavir may be considered as an alternative \nregimen. \n \nExcipients \n \nTybost contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic \nreactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate.  Increased plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including atazanavir and \ndarunavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat. \n \nCobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6.  \nCo-administration with cobicistat can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nCobicistat inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  \nCo-administration of Tybost with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters can result \nin increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products (see section 4.4). \n \nCobicistat is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. \n \nCobicistat is not expected to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp (MDR1). \n \nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1.  If switching pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required during the \nfirst two weeks of treatment with Tybost, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered \nmedicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nConcomitant use contraindicated \n \nMedicinal products that are extensively metabolised by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism \nappear to be the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co-administered with cobicistat.  \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products such as dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, \nergometrine, orally administered midazolam, triazolam, amiodarone, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, \nalfuzosin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and sildenafil which are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance \nand for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening \nevents is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (such as \nSt. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) may \nresult in decreased plasma concentrations of cobicistat and consequently that of atazanavir or \ndarunavir being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance \n(see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are moderate to weak inducers of CYP3A \nmay result in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat and consequently that of atazanavir or \ndarunavir being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance.  \nSome examples include, but are not limited to, etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, and bosentan (see \nTable 3). \n \nCo-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased \nplasma concentration of cobicistat.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, and voriconazole (see Table 3). \n \nCobicistat co-administered with atazanavir or darunavir should not be used in combination with \nanother antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co-administration with \nan inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another protease \ninhibitor).  Dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and may result \nin decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir, darunavir and/or the other antiretroviral agents that \nrequire pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of antiviral activity and development of resistance. \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions of cobicistat and potential co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 3 below \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d).  These interactions are based on \neither drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction \nand potential for serious and/or life-threatening events or loss of efficacy. \n \nFor additional drug-drug interactions with atazanavir or darunavir, consult their respective Summary \nof Product Characteristics when using Tybost. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 3: Interactions between cobicistat and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with cobicistat \n\n150 mg and atazanavir or darunavir \nANTIRETROVIRALS \nNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) \nTenofovir disoproxil1  Co-administration of tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil with cobicistat is \nexpected to increase tenofovir \nplasma concentration. \n \nTenofovir: \nAUC: \u2191 23% \nCmax: \u2191 55% \n\nThis increase is not considered to be \nclinically relevant and does not necessitate \ndose adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil. \n\nNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) \nEfavirenz (600 mg single dose) Co-administration of efavirenz \n\nand cobicistat is expected to \ndecrease cobicistat plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nEfavirenz: \nAUC: \u2194 \nCmax: \u2193 13% \nCmin: ND \n\nAtazanavir or darunavir plasma \nconcentrations may decrease as a \nconsequence of a reduction in cobicistat \nplasma concentrations, which may result in \nloss of therapeutic effect and development \nof resistance.

Increased monitoring \nfor rifabutin-associated adverse reactions \nincluding neutropenia and uveitis is \nwarranted due to an expected increase in \nexposure to desacetyl-rifabutin.  Further \ndose reduction of rifabutin has not been \nstudied.  It should be kept in mind that a \ntwice weekly dose of 150 mg may not \nprovide an optimal exposure to rifabutin \nthus leading to a risk of rifabutin resistance \nand a treatment failure. \n\nMacrolide antibiotics \nClarithromycin Interaction not studied. \n\n \nConcentrations of \nclarithromycin may be \nincreased upon \nco-administration with \ncobicistat. \n\nConcentrations of clarithromycin may be \nincreased upon co-administration of \ncobicistat.

Therapy with cobicistat and \natazanavir or darunavir should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant \nduring therapy with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir should be switched to an alternative \nregimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether cobicistat/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of cobicistat/metabolites in \nmilk.  A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore, Tybost should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of cobicistat on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of cobicistat on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTybost has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  However, patients \nshould be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with cobicistat-containing \nregimens. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions for cobicistat-boosted atazanavir were consistent with the safety profile of ritonavir-\nboosted atazanavir.  The most frequently reported adverse reactions to cobicistat-boosted atazanavir \nwere associated with elevated bilirubin levels (see Table 4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of cobicistat is based on 144-week data from a phase 3, randomised, active-controlled \nclinical Study (GS-US-216-0114), in which 692 treatment-na\u00efve patients received at least one dose of \ncobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 344) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (n = 348) administered with \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination.  Of these 692 patients, 613 \n(300 atazanavir/cobicistat and 313 atazanavir/ritonavir) and 496 (250 atazanavir/cobicistat and \n246 atazanavir/ritonavir) received at least 48 and 144 weeks of treatment, respectively. \n \nAdverse reactions to cobicistat-boosted atazanavir during 144 weeks of clinical trial experience from \nStudy GS-US-216-0114 are listed in Table 4, below, by body system organ class and frequency.  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (frequency cannot \nbe estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 4: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions to cobicistat-boosted atazanavir based on \nexperience of 144 weeks from phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0114 \n \nFrequency Adverse reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nCommon: hyperglycaemia, increased appetite \nPsychiatric disorders: \nCommon: insomnia, abnormal dreams  \nUncommon: depression, sleep disorder \nNervous system disorders: \nCommon: headache, dizziness, somnolence, dysgeusia \nEye disorders: \nVery common: ocular icterus \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: nausea \n\nCommon: vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence, dry mouth \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nVery common: jaundice \nCommon: hyperbilirubinaemia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon: rash \nUncommon: pruritus \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: myalgia \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: nephrolithiasis, haematuria, proteinuria \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: pyrexia, asthenia \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRenal impairment \nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine.  An increase from baseline in serum creatinine solely due to cobicistat\u2019s \ninhibitory effect generally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dl. \n \nIn Study GS-US-216-0114, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment \nwith cobicistat, after which they stabilised.  The mean (\u00b1 SD) change in estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment was -15.1 \u00b1 16.5 ml/min in the \ncobicistat-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose \ncombination group and -8.0 \u00b1 16.8 ml/min in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination group. \n \nEffects on the liver \nIn Study GS-US-216-0114, hyperbilirubinaemia (> 1 x ULN) was common: 97.7% in the cobicistat-\nboosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination group, \nand 97.4% in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \nfixed-dose combination group through 144 weeks of treatment.  However, a higher percentage of \nsubjects in the cobicistat-boosted group had increases in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN than those in the \nritonavir-boosted group (88.0% versus 80.9%).  The rates of study drug discontinuation due to \nbilirubin-related adverse events were low and similar in both groups (4.9% in the cobicistat-boosted \ngroup and 4.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group).  An increase of > 3 x ULN in alanine \naminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase was recorded in 12.8% of subjects in the cobicistat-\nboosted group and 9.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of cobicistat was evaluated in 21 HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric \npatients between the ages of 12 to < 18 years through 48 weeks in an open-label clinical study \n(GS-US-216-0128) of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 14) or darunavir (n = 7) plus two NRTIs.  In \nthis study, the safety profile of cobicistat was similar to that in adults. \n \nOther special population(s) \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of Tybost in 73 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault method 50-89 ml/min) who switched pharmacokinetic \nenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat was evaluated in an open-label clinical Study (GS-US-236-0118) \nof cobicistat-boosted atazanavir or darunavir plus two NRTIs.  At week 96 the mean change in serum \ncreatinine was 0.07 \u00b1 0.15 mg/dl and the mean change in eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault method \nwas -6.2 \u00b1 9.07 ml/min.  The effect of cobicistat on serum creatinine and eGFR in patients switching \nfrom ritonavir to cobicistat in Study GS-US-236-0118 was consistent with the effect in treatment-\nna\u00efve patients in Study GS-US-216-0114. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment \nof overdose with cobicistat consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs \nas well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with cobicistat.  As cobicistat is highly bound to plasma \nproteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, ATC code: V03AX03 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nCobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily.  \nInhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A \nsubstrates (such as atazanavir or darunavir) that have limited oral bioavailability and a short half-life \ndue to CYP3A-dependent metabolism. \n \nThe effect of cobicistat on atazanavir pharmacokinetics was demonstrated in the pharmacokinetic sub-\nstudy (n = 48) of the phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0114 in which HIV-1 infected patients received \natazanavir 300 mg + cobicistat 150 mg or atazanavir 300 mg + ritonavir 100 mg, both in combination \nwith emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination.  The steady-state \npharmacokinetic parameters of atazanavir were comparable when boosted with cobicistat versus \nritonavir (see Table 5). \n \nTable 5: Pharmacokinetic parameters [mean \u00b1 SD (%CV)] of atazanavir in the pharmacokinetic \nsub-study of phase 3 Study GS-US-216-0114 \n \n\nAtazanavir \npharmacokinetics \n\nparameters \nAtazanavir + cobicistata \n\n(n = 22) \nAtazanavir + ritonavira \n\n(n = 26) \nAUCtau (\u00b5g\u2022h/ml) 46.13 \u00b1 26.18 (56.8) 47.59 \u00b1 24.39 (51.2) \n\nCmax (\u00b5g/ml) 3.91 \u00b1 1.94 (49.6) 4.76 \u00b1 1.94 (40.8) \nCtau (\u00b5g/ml) 0.80 \u00b1 0.72 (90.3) 0.85 \u00b1 0.72 (84.7) \n\na Plus background regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg fixed-dose \ncombination \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic enhancing effect of cobicistat on darunavir was evaluated in a phase 1 clinical \nStudy GS-US-216-0115 in 31 healthy subjects that were administered darunavir 800 mg in \ncombination with cobicistat 150 mg or ritonavir 100 mg, all once daily, for 10 days.

Viruses were known to be susceptible to atazanavir, emtricitabine and \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate at baseline. \n \nBaseline characteristics and treatment outcomes at weeks 48 and 144 for Study GS-US-216-0114 are \npresented in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. \n \nTable 7: Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve \nHIV-1 infected adult subjects in Study GS-US-216-0114 \n \n\n \n\nAtazanavir + cobicistata \n(n = 344) \n\nAtazanavir + \nritonavira \n(n = 348) \n\nDemographic characteristics   \nMedian age, years (min-max)  36 \n\n(19-62) \n37 \n\n(19-70) \nSex   \n\nMale 83.4% 82.5% \nFemale 16.6% 17.5% \n\nEthnicity   \nWhite 57.6% 61.8% \nBlack or African Heritage 18.9% 18.1% \nAsian 12.8% 10.6% \nOther 10.8% 9.5% \n\nBaseline disease characteristics   \nMedian baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA (range) \nlog10 copies/ml \n\n4.78 \n(3.22-6.43) \n\n4.84 \n(3.21-6.44) \n\nPercentage of subjects with viral load \n> 100,000 copies/ml \n\n38.4% 41.1% \n\nMedian baseline CD4+ cell count (range), \ncells/mm3 \n\n348 \n(1-1,075) \n\n341 \n(10-1,455) \n\nPercentage of subjects with CD4+ cell count \n\u2264 200 cells/mm3 \n\n17.4% 16.4% \n\na Plus background regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg fixed-dose \ncombination \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 8: Virologic outcome of randomised treatment of Study GS-US-216-0114 at weeks 48 and \n144 \n \n Week 48a Week 144b \n\n \n\nAtazanavir + \ncobicistatf \n(n = 344) \n\nAtazanavir + \nritonavirf \n(n = 348) \n\nAtazanavir + \ncobicistatf \n(n = 344) \n\nAtazanavir + \nritonavirf \n(n = 348) \n\nVirologic success \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml 85% 87% 72% 74% \n\nTreatment difference -2.2% (95% CI = -7.4%, 3.0%) -2.1% (95% CI = -8.7%, 4.5%) \nVirologic failurec 6% 4% 8% 5% \nNo virologic data in week 48 \nor 144 window 9% 9% 20% 21% \n\nDiscontinued study drug due to \nAE or deathd 6% 7% 11% 11% \n\nDiscontinued study drug due to \nother reasons and last available \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mle \n\n3% 2% 8% 10% \n\nMissing data during window but \non study drug 0% 0% < 1% < 1% \na Week 48 window is between day 309 and 378 (inclusive) \nb Week 144 window is between day 967 and 1,050 (inclusive) \nc Includes subjects who had \u2265 50 copies/ml in the week 48 or 144 windows; subjects who discontinued early \n\ndue to lack or loss of efficacy; subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or \nlack or loss of efficacy, and at the time of discontinuation had a viral value of \u2265 50 copies/ml. \n\nd Includes patients who discontinued due to adverse event (AE) or death at any time point from day 1 through \nthe time window if this resulted in no virologic data on treatment during the specified window. \n\ne Includes subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death, or lack or loss of efficacy, \ne.g., withdrew consent, loss to follow-up. \n\nf Plus background regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg fixed-dose \ncombination \n\n \nAtazanavir + cobicistat + emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination was \nnon-inferior in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml when compared to atazanavir + ritonavir \n+ emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate fixed-dose combination. \n \nChanges in CD4+ cell counts through 48 and 144 weeks in Study GS-US-216-0114 are presented in \nTable 9. \n \nTable 9: Changes in CD4+ cell counts through weeks 48 and 144 in Study GS-US-216-0114 \n \n Week 48 Week 144 \n Atazanavir + \n\ncobicistata \n(n = 344) \n\nAtazanavir + \nritonavira \n(n = 348) \n\nAtazanavir + \ncobicistata \n(n = 344) \n\nAtazanavir + \nritonavira \n(n = 348) \n\nMean increase \nfrom baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell \ncount (cells/mm3)b \n\n213 219 310 332 \n\na Plus background regimen of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg fixed-dose \ncombination \n\nb Missing = excluded analysis \n \nIn an analysis of treatment-failure subjects in Study GS-US-216-0114 through week 144, evaluable \ngenotypic data from paired baseline and treatment-failure isolates were available for all 21 virologic \nfailures in the cobicistat group.  Among the 21 patients, 3 developed the emtricitabine-associated \nresistance substitution M184V.  No subject developed the tenofovir-associated resistance substitutions \n\n\n\n21 \n\nK65R or K70E, or any primary resistance substitution associated with protease inhibitors.  In the \nritonavir group, genotypic data was available for all 19 virologic failures.  Among the 19 patients, \n1 developed the emtricitabine-associated resistance substitution M184V with no tenofovir- or primary \nprotease inhibitor-associated resistance substitutions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of cobicistat with atazanavir or darunavir were evaluated in an open-label \nphase 2/3 Study GS-US-216-0128 in 21 HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed paediatric patients \nbetween the ages of 12 and < 18 years with baseline estimated creatinine clearance \u226590 mL/min.  \nPatients received cobicistat 150 mg once daily with either atazanavir 300 mg once daily (n = 14) or \ndarunavir 800 mg once daily (n = 7), each administered with a background regimen containing two \nNRTIs. \n \nThe mean age of patients was 14 years (range: 12 to 17); 62% were male; 38% were Asian, 33% were \nWhite, and 19% were Black.  At baseline, 20/21 subjects had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and \n1 subject had plasma HIV-1 RNA = 50 copies/mL. \n \nIn patients treated with cobicistat + atazanavir, the median baseline CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was \n770 cells/mm3 (range: 486 to 1765) and 33% (range: 23% to 45%), respectively.  At Week 48, 93% \n(13/14) of patients retained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and the median change from baseline in \nCD4+ cell count and CD4+% was -60 cells/mm3 and -0.3%, respectively.  In patients treated with \ncobicistat + darunavir, the median baseline CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was 1117 cells/mm3 \n(range: 658 to 2416) and 45% (range: 28% to 56%), respectively.  At Week 48, 86% (6/7) of patients \nretained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (1 subject had missing data) and the median change from \nbaseline in CD4+ cell count and CD4+% was -342 cells/mm3 and -6%, respectively.  Overall, 3 of 21 \npatients qualified for resistance analysis: 1 patient showed no resistance in protease or reverse \ntranscriptase and 2 had missing data due to assay failure. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ncobicistat in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of HIV-1 infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of cobicistat with food in HIV-1 infected subjects, peak plasma \nconcentrations were observed 4 hours post-dose for cobicistat.  The steady-state mean Cmax, AUCtau, \nand Ctrough (mean \u00b1 SD) following multiple doses of cobicistat in HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 68), \nrespectively, were 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5g/ml, 10.9 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml, and 0.07 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nA food effect study was not conducted for Tybost.  In clinical studies, cobicistat was co-administered \nwith atazanavir or darunavir under fed conditions, in accordance with the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for these agents.  It is recommended that Tybost be administered with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nCobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio was 2. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not \nundergo glucuronidation.  Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 99% of circulating \nradioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat.  Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and \nfaeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces \nand urine, respectively.  The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \nTybost is approximately 3-4 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nCobicistat exposures are non-linear and greater than dose-proportional over the range of 50 mg to \n400 mg, consistent with a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. \n \nElderly \n \nPharmacokinetics of cobicistat have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older). \n \nGender \n \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for cobicistat. \n \nEthnicity \n \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for cobicistat. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years who received cobicistat-boosted atazanavir (n = 14) or \ndarunavir (n = 7) in Study GS-US-216-0128, exposures of atazanavir and cobicistat (AUCtau, Cmax, and \nCtrough) were higher (24% to 180%) than in adults; however, the increases were not considered \nclinically significant as the safety profiles were similar in adult and paediatric patients.  Mean \ndarunavir Ctrough was lower (61%) in the paediatric patients relative to adults but was not considered \nclinically significant based on exposure-response relationships.  The pharmacokinetics of cobicistat in \npaediatric subjects < 12 years of age or < 35 kg have not been established. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA study of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min).  No meaningful differences \nin cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal impairment and \nhealthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nCobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A study of the pharmacokinetics of \ncobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B).  No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed \nbetween subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects.  No dose adjustment of cobicistat is \nnecessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The effect of severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \n \nPharmacokinetics of cobicistat have not been fully evaluated in hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infected \nsubjects. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development.  No teratogenic effects were \nobserved in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies.  In rats, ossification changes in the spinal \ncolumn and sternebra of foetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. \n \nEx vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT \nprolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean \nconcentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily \ndose. \n \nA long term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this \nspecies that is regarded as of no relevance for humans.  A long term carcinogenicity study in mice did \nnot show any carcinogenic potential. \n \nThe active substance cobicistat is persistent in the environment. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTybost 150 mg film-coated tablets \ncobicistat \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tybost is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Tybost \n3. How to take Tybost \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tybost \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tybost is and what it is used for \n \nTybost contains the active substance cobicistat. \n \nTybost is used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, the virus that \ncauses acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  It is used in HIV-1 infected adults and \nadolescents aged 12 years and older: \n\u2022 weighing at least 35 kg (when co-administered with atazanavir 300 mg) or \n\u2022 weighing at least 40 kg (when co-administered with darunavir 800 mg). \n \nTybost acts as a booster (enhancer) of atazanavir or darunavir (both protease inhibitors) to improve \ntheir effect (see section 3 of this leaflet). \n \nTybost does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir and darunavir in the \nblood.  It does this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir and darunavir which will make them \nstay in the body for longer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tybost \n \nDo not take Tybost \n \n\u2022 If you are allergic to cobicistat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\u2022 If you are taking medicines containing any of the following: \n\n- alfuzosin, used to treat an enlarged prostate gland \n- amiodarone, quinidine, used to correct irregular heartbeats \n- dabigatran, used to prevent and treat blood clots \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, used to prevent seizures \n- rifampicin, used to prevent and treat tuberculosis and other infections \n- dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, used to treat migraine headache \n\n\n\n33 \n\n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and \nanxiety \n\n- lovastatin, simvastatin, used to lower blood cholesterol \n- pimozide, lurasidone, used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings \n- sildenafil, used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension \u2013 a lung disease that makes \n\nbreathing difficult \n- orally administered midazolam, triazolam, used to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety \n\n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, you should not take Tybost and you should tell your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Tybost. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine does not directly treat your HIV infection.  You may still develop infections or \nother illnesses associated with HIV infection.  You must keep in regular contact with your doctor. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Tybost: \n \n\u2022 If you are taking another protease inhibitor.  Tybost taken with atazanavir or darunavir \n\nshould not be used with another antiviral medicine that requires boosting. \n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have \n\nshown problems with your kidneys.  Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you \nwith Tybost. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have or have had severe liver disease, or if tests \n\nhave shown problems with your liver.  Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat \nyou with Tybost. \n\n \n\uf0e0 If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Tybost. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age, or who weigh less than 35 kg (or 40 kg) \nas explained in section 3 of this leaflet.  The use of Tybost in children under 12 years of age or who \nweigh less than 35 kg has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Tybost \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Tybost may interact with other substances.  As a result, the amounts of Tybost or other \nmedicines in your blood may be affected.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or \nmay make any side effects worse.

In this study, the reported PK data showed \nlower exposures of cobicistat (COBI) and atazanavir (ATV) when cobicistat (COBI) was used as a \nbooster with ATV during pregnancy specially in the second and third trimester compared to \npostpartum. This finding was consistent with previous studies which showed lower exposures of \nelvitegravir (EVG) and darunavir (DRV) after their use with COBI as a booster during pregnancy \n{Best 2017, Momper 2018}. \n \nThe COBI CCDS was previously updated to include the statement that lower exposures of COBI have \nbeen reported during pregnancy and to closely monitor viral load in pregnant women (reported in a \nprevious COBI PSUR [27 August 2017 -26 August 2018]).Consequently, the MAH has submitted a \nproposal to update the COBI SmPC and PL, which has been endorsed with minor changes.  \n \nOf note, this proposal to update the product information of Tybost is consistent with the previously \napproved pregnancy update relating to the use of darunavir and cobicistat during pregnancy \n(procedure EMEA/H/C/002572/WS1401/0044), and with the recently approved pregnancy update to \nthe EVOTAZ (atazanavir/cobicistat) product information (procedure EMEA/H/C/003904/II/0030). \n \nTherefore, and as proposed by the MAH, the SmPC and the PL of medicinal products containing \ncobicistat are updated to add a warning to not initiate atazanavir/cobicistat during pregnancy, and to \nswitch to an alternative regimen for women who become pregnant during therapy with \natazanavir/cobicistat. Consequently, the current recommendation that cobicistat and atazanavir should \nonly be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus and \nmother should be deleted. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for cobicistat the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cobicistat is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
