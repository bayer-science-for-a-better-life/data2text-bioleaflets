NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTopotecan Eagle 3 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 3 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride). \n \nEach 1 ml single dose vial contains 3 mg of topotecan. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nA clear light yellow to orange solution, pH ≤ 1.2. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer \n(SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix \nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to \ncisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nWhen used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin should be \nconsulted. \n \nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count \nof ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion \nif necessary). \n \nSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma \n \nInitial dose \nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area/day administered by intravenous \ninfusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three week interval between the start \nof each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥ 1 x 109/l, the platelet count \nis ≥ 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medications (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil \ncount < 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or \nwho have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day to \n1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical trials, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2 and a further dose reduction \nwas required to manage adverse effects. \n \nCervical Carcinoma \n \nInitial dose \nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as 30 minute intravenous \ninfusion daily on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a \ndose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every \n21 days for six courses or until progressive disease. \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is more than or equal to \n1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count is more than or equal to 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is more \nthan or equal to 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count less than \n0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection or who \nhave had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20 % to \n0.60 mg/m2/day for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. \n \nDosage in renally impaired patients \nMonotherapy (Small cell lung carcinoma) \nInsufficient data are available to make a recommendation for patients with a creatinine clearance \n< 20 ml/min. Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment. The recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with small cell lung \ncarcinoma and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for five \nconsecutive days. \n \nCombination therapy (Cervical carcinoma) \nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, \ntherapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl. If, during \ntopotecan/cisplatin combination therapy serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that \nthe full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. \nIf cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with \ntopotecan in patients with cervical cancer. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe experience in children is limited, therefore no recommendation for treatment of paediatric patients \nwith topotecan can be given (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nThe concentration of topotecan in the 1 ml vial is higher (3 mg/ml) than with other topotecan products. \nIt is important that Topotecan Eagle is further diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \nConcentration must be noticed or life-threatening overdose may occur. \n \nTopotecan Eagle contains a higher dose concentration (3 mg/ml) than other topotecan products \nfor intravenous infusion (usually 1 mg/ml). Topotecan Eagle must be diluted to a final \nconcentration between 25 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml (see section 6.6 for dilution instructions). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTopotecan is contraindicated in patients who \n− have a history of severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n− are breast feeding (see section 4.6) \n− already have severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by \n\nbaseline neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTopotecan Eagle requires appropriate dilution before use. The concentration of topotecan in \nTopotecan Eagle differs from other topotecan products (see section 6.6 for further instructions on \ndilution). \n \nConcentration must be noticed or life-threatening overdose may occur. \n \nTopotecan Eagle contains a higher dose concentration (3 mg/ml) than other topotecan products \nfor intravenous infusion (usually 1 mg/ml). Topotecan Eagle must be diluted to a final \nconcentration between 25 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml (see section 6.6 for dilution instructions). \n \nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be monitored \nregularly (see section 4.2). \n \nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). \n \nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have \nbeen reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a \ncompatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. \n \nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been \nfatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, \nthoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating factors. \nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea \nand/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. \n \nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with \nclinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing topotecan, \ne.g. in case patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. \n \nAs expected, patients with poor performance status (PS>1) have a lower response rate and an \nincreased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nAccurate assessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that \npatients have not deteriorated to performance status 3. \n \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin \n≥ 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in these patient groups. \n \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 for five days every three weeks. A reduction in topotecan \nclearance was observed. However there are insufficient data available to make a dose recommendation \nfor this patient group. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In an intravenous population study, \nthe co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did not appear to have a \nsignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nIn combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal \nproduct may be required to improve tolerability. However, in combining with platinum agents, there is \na distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on day 1 \nor 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan \ndosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each \nagent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. \n \nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on Day 1) \nwere administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12 %, n = 9) and \nCmax (23 %, n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical \nrelevance. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, effective contraceptive methods must be advised when either \npartner is treated with topotecan. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies \n(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and \ntherefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntherapy with topotecan. \n \nPregnancy \nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. \n \nBreastfeeding \nTopotecan is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known \nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start \nof therapy. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats \n(see section 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products topotecan is genotoxic and \neffects on fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ncaution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn dose-finding trials involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with \nrelapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be \nhaematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative \nhaematological or non-haematological toxicity. \n \nThe adverse event profile for topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical \ncancer clinical trials is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall \nhaematological toxicity is lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin \ncompared to topotecan monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone. \n \nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin, \nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and not attributable to topotecan. \nThe prescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events \nassociated cisplatin use. \n \nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported events). \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), \nincluding isolated reports and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n Blood and lymphatic system disorders \n Very common: febrile neutropenia, neutropenia (see Gastrointestinal disorders), \n thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia \n Common: pancytopenia \n Not known: severe bleeding (associated with thrombocytopenia) \n \n Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Rare: interstitial lung disease (some cases have been fatal) \n \n Gastrointestinal disorders \n Very common: nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all of which may be severe), constipation, \n abdominal pain1, mucositis \n 1 Neutropenic colitis, including fatal neutropenic colitis, has been reported to occur as a \n complication of topotecan-induced neutropenia (see section 4.4) \n \n Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Very common: alopecia \n Common: pruritus \n \n Metabolism and nutrition disorders \n Very common: anorexia (which may be severe) \n \n Infections and infestations \n Very common: infection \n Common: sepsis2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n 2 Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated with topotecan (see section 4.4) \n \n General disorders and administration site conditions \n Very common: pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue \n Common: malaise \n Very rare: extravasation3 \n 3 Extravasation has been reported very rarely.

In \nassociation with severe neutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 \nand overall in 23 % of patients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was \nnine days and the median duration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in \n11 % of courses overall. Among all patients treated in clinical trials (including both those with severe \nneutropenia and those who did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) developed \nfever and 26 % (9 % of courses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients treated (1 % of \ncourses) developed sepsis (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia: Severe (platelets less than 25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); \nmoderate (platelets between 25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time \nto onset of severe thrombocytopenia was Day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet \ntransfusions were given in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with \nthrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent. \n \nAnaemia: Moderate to severe (Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell \ntransfusions were given in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses). \n \nNon-haematological \nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal such as nausea (52 %), vomiting \n(32 %), and diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). Severe (grade 3 or 4) nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis incidence was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % respectively. \n \nMild abdominal pain was also reported amongst 4 % of patients. \n \nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients whilst receiving \ntopotecan. Severe (grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia incidence was 3 and 3 % respectively. \n \nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nOther severe events occurring in patients that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan \ntreatment were anorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical trials, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of patients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. The primary complications of overdose are \nanticipated to be bone marrow suppression and mucositis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17. \n \nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately \ninvolved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving \nreplication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme \nand strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of \ninhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA single-strand \nbreaks. \n \nRelapsed SCLC \n \nA phase III trial (study 478) compared oral topotecan plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) (n = 71) with \nBSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan + BSC, 90 days for BSC) and for \nwhom retreatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. Oral topotecan plus \nBSC group had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the BSC \nalone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for oral topotecan plus BSC group \nrelative to BSC alone group was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.90). The median survival for patients treated \nwith topotecan + BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 18.3, 31.6) compared to 13.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 11.1, \n18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). \n \nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan + BSC. \n \nOne Phase 2 study (Study 065) and one Phase 3 study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed ≥ 90 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-\nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies. \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl P\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1.

Median time to \nprogression was similar in the two groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks respectively). Median survivals \nfor the two groups were 25.0 and 24.7 weeks respectively. The hazard ratio for survival of IV \ntopotecan relative to CAV was 1.04 (95 % CI 0.78 – 1.40). \n \nThe response rate to topotecan in the combined small cell lung cancer programme (n = 480) for \npatients with relapsed disease sensitive to first-line therapy, was 20.2 %.

In those \n(n = 102) with recurrence after 180 days, the median survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm was \n9.9 months (95 % C.I.: 7, 12.6) versus 6.3 months (95 % C.I.: 4.9, 9.5) for the cisplatin arm with an \nhazard ratio of 0.75 (0.49, 1.16). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTopotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on efficacy and \nsafety are available. \n \nIn an open-label trial involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or \nprogressive solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a \n30-minute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on response to \ntherapy. Tumour types included were Ewing's Sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, \nneuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Antitumour activity was demonstrated \nprimarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent \nand refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, \nforty-six (43 %) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1 %) courses; sixty-five (60 %) received \ntransfusions of Packed Red Blood Cells and fifty (46 %) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses \n(30.5 % and 34.9 %) respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the \nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day \nwithout G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30 minute \ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), \ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of \ndistribution, about 132 l, (SD 57) and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of \npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of \ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is \nlittle or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nin the PK after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of topotecan is low \n(35 %) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. \n \nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of \ntopotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate. \n \nMetabolism accounts for < 10 % of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which \nwas shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, \nplasma, and faeces. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was less than 10 % for both total topotecan \nand topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has \nbeen identified in the urine. \n \nOverall recovery of medicinal product-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was \n71 to 76 % of the administered intravenous dose. Approximately 51 % was excreted as total topotecan \nand 3 % was excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan \naccounted for 18 % while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the \nN-desmethyl metabolite contributed a mean of less than 7 % (range 4-9 %) of the total medicinal \nproduct related material accounted for in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and \nN-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide in the urine were less than 2.0 %. \n \nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of N-\ndemethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A nor did it inhibit the human cytosolic \nenzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. \n \nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of \ntopotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \ndecreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was \nincreased by about 30 % but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma clearance \nof total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only decreased by \nabout 10 % compared with the control group of patients. \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to \nabout 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus \nhalf-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma \nclearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from 1.9 hours \nto 4.9 hours. \n \nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect \non clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two \nstudies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 mg/m2 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to 12 years, \nn = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9), and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, n = 9) with \nrefractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 mg/m2 to 5.2 mg/m2 in \nchildren (n = 8), adolescents (n = 3), and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these studies, there \nwere no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, adolescents, and \nyoung adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to draw definite \nconclusions. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTopotecan Eagle 15 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 3 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride). \n \nEach 5 ml multi dose vial contains 15 mg of topotecan. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nA clear light yellow to orange solution, pH ≤ 1.2. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer \n(SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix \nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to \ncisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nWhen used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for cisplatin should be \nconsulted. \n \nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count \nof ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion \nif necessary). \n \nSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma \n \nInitial dose \nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area/day administered by intravenous \ninfusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three week interval between the start \nof each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1). \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥ 1 x 109/l, the platelet count \nis ≥ 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil \ncount < 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, or \nwho have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 0.25 mg/m2/day to \n1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical trials, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2 and a further dose reduction \nwas required to manage adverse effects. \n \nCervical Carcinoma \n \nInitial dose \nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as 30 minute intravenous \ninfusion daily on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a \ndose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every \n21 days for six courses or until progressive disease. \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is more than or equal to \n1.5 x 109/l, the platelet count is more than or equal to 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is more \nthan or equal to 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary). \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan with \nother medications (e.g. G-CSF) or to dose reduce to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count less than \n0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection or who \nhave had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20 % to \n0.60 mg/m2/day for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. \n \nDosage in renally impaired patients \nMonotherapy (Small cell lung carcinoma) \nInsufficient data are available to make a recommendation for patients with a creatinine clearance \n< 20 ml/min. Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment. The recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with small cell lung \ncarcinoma and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for five \nconsecutive days. \n \nCombination therapy (Cervical carcinoma) \nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical cancer, \ntherapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl. If, during \ntopotecan/cisplatin combination therapy serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that \nthe full prescribing information be consulted for any advice on cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. \nIf cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data regarding continuing monotherapy with \ntopotecan in patients with cervical cancer. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe experience in children is limited, therefore no recommendation for treatment of paediatric patients \nwith topotecan can be given (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nThe concentration of topotecan in the 5 ml vial is higher (3 mg/ml) than with other topotecan products. \nIt is important that Topotecan Eagle is further diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \nConcentration must be noticed or life-threatening overdose may occur. \n \nTopotecan Eagle contains a higher dose concentration (3 mg/ml) than other topotecan products \nfor intravenous infusion (usually 1 mg/ml). Topotecan Eagle must be diluted to a final \nconcentration between 25 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml (see section 6.6 for dilution instructions). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nTopotecan is contraindicated in patients who \n− have a history of severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n− are breast feeding (see section 4.6) \n− already have severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by \n\nbaseline neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTopotecan Eagle requires appropriate dilution before use. The concentration of topotecan in \nTopotecan Eagle differs from other topotecan products (see section 6.6 for further instructions on \ndilution). \n \nConcentration must be noticed or life-threatening overdose may occur. \n \nTopotecan Eagle contains a higher dose concentration (3 mg/ml) than other topotecan products \nfor intravenous infusion (usually 1 mg/ml). Topotecan Eagle must be diluted to a final \nconcentration between 25 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml (see section 6.6 for dilution instructions). \n \nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be monitored \nregularly (see section 4.2). \n \nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). \n \nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have \nbeen reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a \ncompatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis should be considered. \n \nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been \nfatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, \nthoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or colony stimulating factors. \nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea \nand/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. \n \nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated with \nclinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing topotecan, \ne.g. in case patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy. \n \nAs expected, patients with poor performance status (PS>1) have a lower response rate and an \nincreased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nAccurate assessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure that \npatients have not deteriorated to performance status 3. \n \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin \n≥ 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in these patient groups. \n \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 for five days every three weeks. A reduction in topotecan \nclearance was observed. However there are insufficient data available to make a dose recommendation \nfor this patient group. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In an intravenous population study, \nthe co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or corticosteroids did not appear to have a \nsignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nIn combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal \nproduct may be required to improve tolerability. However, in combining with platinum agents, there is \na distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on day 1 \nor 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan \ndosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each \nagent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. \n \nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on Day 1) \nwere administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12 %, n = 9) and \nCmax (23 %, n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical \nrelevance. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, effective contraceptive methods must be advised when either \npartner is treated with topotecan. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies \n(see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and \ntherefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during \ntherapy with topotecan. \n \nPregnancy \nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus. \n \nBreastfeeding \nTopotecan is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). Although it is not known \nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start \nof therapy. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats \n(see section 5.3). However, as with other cytotoxic medicinal products topotecan is genotoxic and \neffects on fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \ncaution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and asthenia persist. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn dose-finding trials involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients with \nrelapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was found to be \nhaematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of cumulative \nhaematological or non-haematological toxicity. \n \nThe adverse event profile for topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical \ncancer clinical trials is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall \nhaematological toxicity is lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin \ncompared to topotecan monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone. \n \nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin, \nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and not attributable to topotecan. \nThe prescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse events \nassociated cisplatin use. \n \nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported events). \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), \nincluding isolated reports and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n Blood and lymphatic system disorders \n Very common: febrile neutropenia, neutropenia (see Gastrointestinal disorders), \n thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia \n Common: pancytopenia \n Not known: severe bleeding (associated with thrombocytopenia) \n \n Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Rare: interstitial lung disease (some cases have been fatal) \n \n Gastrointestinal disorders \n Very common: nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all of which may be severe), constipation, \n abdominal pain1, mucositis \n 1 Neutropenic colitis, including fatal neutropenic colitis, has been reported to occur as a \n complication of topotecan-induced neutropenia (see section 4.4) \n \n Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Very common: alopecia \n Common: pruritus \n \n Metabolism and nutrition disorders \n Very common: anorexia (which may be severe) \n \n Infections and infestations \n Very common: infection \n Common: sepsis2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n 2 Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated with topotecan (see section 4.4) \n \n General disorders and administration site conditions \n Very common: pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue \n Common: malaise \n Very rare: extravasation3 \n 3 Extravasation has been reported very rarely. Reactions have been mild and have not generally \n required specific therapy. \n \n Immune system disorders \n Common: hypersensitivity reaction including rash \n Rare: anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria \n \n Hepato-biliary disorders \n Common: hyperbilirubinaemia \n \nThe incidence of adverse events listed above have the potential to occur with a higher frequency in \npatients who have a poor performance status (see section 4.4). \n \nThe frequencies associated with the haematological and non-haematological adverse events listed \nbelow represent the adverse event reports considered to be related/possibly related to topotecan \ntherapy. \n \nHaematological \nNeutropenia: Severe (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/l) during course 1 was seen in 55 % of the patients \nand with duration ≥ seven days in 20 % and overall in 77 % of patients (39 % of courses). In \nassociation with severe neutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 \nand overall in 23 % of patients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was \nnine days and the median duration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in \n11 % of courses overall. Among all patients treated in clinical trials (including both those with severe \nneutropenia and those who did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) developed \nfever and 26 % (9 % of courses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients treated (1 % of \ncourses) developed sepsis (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia: Severe (platelets less than 25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); \nmoderate (platelets between 25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time \nto onset of severe thrombocytopenia was Day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet \ntransfusions were given in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with \nthrombocytopenia including fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent. \n \nAnaemia: Moderate to severe (Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell \ntransfusions were given in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses). \n \nNon-haematological \nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal such as nausea (52 %), vomiting \n(32 %), and diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). Severe (grade 3 or 4) nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis incidence was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % respectively. \n \nMild abdominal pain was also reported amongst 4 % of patients. \n \nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients whilst receiving \ntopotecan. Severe (grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia incidence was 3 and 3 % respectively. \n \nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nOther severe events occurring in patients that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan \ntreatment were anorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical trials, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of patients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. The primary complications of overdose are \nanticipated to be bone marrow suppression and mucositis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17. \n \nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme intimately \ninvolved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving \nreplication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme \nand strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of \ninhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-associated DNA single-strand \nbreaks. \n \nRelapsed SCLC \n \nA phase III trial (study 478) compared oral topotecan plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) (n = 71) with \nBSC alone (n = 70) in patients who had relapsed following first line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan + BSC, 90 days for BSC) and for \nwhom retreatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. Oral topotecan plus \nBSC group had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the BSC \nalone group (Log-rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for oral topotecan plus BSC group \nrelative to BSC alone group was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.90). The median survival for patients treated \nwith topotecan + BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 18.3, 31.6) compared to 13.9 weeks (95 % C.I. 11.1, \n18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). \n \nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan + BSC. \n \nOne Phase 2 study (Study 065) and one Phase 3 study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed ≥ 90 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self-\nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies. \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl P\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nTable 1.

Median time to \nprogression was similar in the two groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks respectively). Median survivals \nfor the two groups were 25.0 and 24.7 weeks respectively. The hazard ratio for survival of IV \ntopotecan relative to CAV was 1.04 (95 % CI 0.78 – 1.40). \n \nThe response rate to topotecan in the combined small cell lung cancer programme (n = 480) for \npatients with relapsed disease sensitive to first-line therapy, was 20.2 %. The median survival was \n30.3 weeks (95 % CI: 27.6, 33.4). \n \nIn a population of patients with refractory SCLC (those not responding to first line therapy), the \nresponse rate to topotecan was 4.0 %. \n \nCervical Carcinoma \n \nIn a randomised, comparative phase III trial conducted by the Gynaecological Oncology Group \n(GOG 0179), topotecan plus cisplatin (n = 147) was compared with cisplatin alone (n = 146) for the \ntreatment of histologically confirmed persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix where \ncurative treatment with surgery and/or radiation was not considered appropriate.

In those \n(n = 102) with recurrence after 180 days, the median survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm was \n9.9 months (95 % C.I.: 7, 12.6) versus 6.3 months (95 % C.I.: 4.9, 9.5) for the cisplatin arm with an \nhazard ratio of 0.75 (0.49, 1.16). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTopotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on efficacy and \nsafety are available. \n \nIn an open-label trial involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or \nprogressive solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a \n30-minute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on response to \ntherapy. Tumour types included were Ewing's Sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, \nneuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Antitumour activity was demonstrated \nprimarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric patients with recurrent \nand refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this study, \nforty-six (43 %) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1 %) courses; sixty-five (60 %) received \ntransfusions of Packed Red Blood Cells and fifty (46 %) of platelets over 139 and 159 courses \n(30.5 % and 34.9 %) respectively. Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the \nmaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day \nwithout G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30 minute \ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), \ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of \ndistribution, about 132 l, (SD 57) and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of \npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of \ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. There is \nlittle or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no evidence of a change \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nin the PK after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate plasma protein binding of topotecan is low \n(35 %) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. \n \nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of clearance of \ntopotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened carboxylate. \n \nMetabolism accounts for < 10 % of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, which \nwas shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was found in urine, \nplasma, and faeces. The mean metabolite:parent AUC ratio was less than 10 % for both total topotecan \nand topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has \nbeen identified in the urine. \n \nOverall recovery of medicinal product-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was \n71 to 76 % of the administered intravenous dose. Approximately 51 % was excreted as total topotecan \nand 3 % was excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan \naccounted for 18 % while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the \nN-desmethyl metabolite contributed a mean of less than 7 % (range 4-9 %) of the total medicinal \nproduct related material accounted for in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and \nN-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide in the urine were less than 2.0 %. \n \nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of N-\ndemethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, \nCYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A nor did it inhibit the human cytosolic \nenzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase. \n \nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance of \ntopotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to 21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \ndecreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan half-life was \nincreased by about 30 % but no clear change in volume of distribution was observed. Plasma clearance \nof total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic impairment only decreased by \nabout 10 % compared with the control group of patients. \n \nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) decreased to \nabout 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly decreased and thus \nhalf-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment topotecan plasma \nclearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life increased from 1.9 hours \nto 4.9 hours. \n \nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant effect \non clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two \nstudies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 mg/m2 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to 12 years, \nn = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9), and young adults (aged 16 to 21 years, n = 9) with \nrefractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 mg/m2 to 5.2 mg/m2 in \nchildren (n = 8), adolescents (n = 3), and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In these studies, there \nwere no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among children, adolescents, and \nyoung adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too limited to draw definite \nconclusions. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; \nhowever, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied. \n \n \n6.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT TOPOTECAN EAGLE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nThe name of your medicine is Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion (called \nTopotecan Eagle in this leaflet). \n \nTopotecan Eagle helps to kill tumour cells. It is a type of chemotherapy. \n \nTopotecan Eagle is used to treat: \n- small cell lung cancer that has come back after chemotherapy \n- advanced cervical cancer when surgery or radiotherapy are not possible. In this case, it is used \n\nwith another medicine called cisplatin. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN TOPOTECAN EAGLE \n \nYou should not receive Topotecan Eagle: \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to topotecan or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in Section 6 \n- if you are breast-feeding. You should stop breast-feeding before starting treatment with \n\nTopotecan Eagle \n- if your blood cell count is too low. Your doctor will check this. \n \nDo not use Topotecan Eagle if any of the above apply to you.

Also some other medicines can affect the way Topotecan \nEagle works. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n- Topotecan Eagle should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. If you are \n\npregnant or think you might be pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. \n- Women who could get pregnant should use contraception to stop them getting pregnant during \n\ntreatment. \n- Men having Topotecan Eagle who wish to father a child should ask their doctor for family \n\nplanning advice. \n- Do not breast-feed while using Topotecan Eagle. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTopotecan Eagle can make you feel tired or weak.

Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT TOPOTECAN EAGLE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nThe name of your medicine is Topotecan Eagle 15 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n(called Topotecan Eagle in this leaflet). \n \nTopotecan Eagle helps to kill tumour cells. It is a type of chemotherapy. \n \nTopotecan Eagle is used to treat: \n- small cell lung cancer that has come back after chemotherapy \n- advanced cervical cancer when surgery or radiotherapy are not possible. In this case, it is used \n\nwith another medicine called cisplatin. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN TOPOTECAN EAGLE \n \nYou should not receive Topotecan Eagle: \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to topotecan or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in Section 6 \n- if you are breast-feeding. You should stop breast-feeding before starting treatment with \n\nTopotecan Eagle \n- if your blood cell count is too low. Your doctor will check this. \n \nDo not use Topotecan Eagle if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor \nor nurse before using this medicine. \n \nTake special care with Topotecan Eagle \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before using your medicine: \n- if you have any kidney problems. Your dose of Topotecan Eagle may need to be adjusted.  \n\nThis medicine is not recommended if you have severe kidney problems; \n- if you have liver problems. Your dose of Topotecan Eagle may need to be adjusted.  \n\nThis medicine is not recommended if you have severe liver problems; \n- if you have lung problems, or if you have had lung problems before from using other medicines \n\nor radiation. This is because you are more likely to get severe lung problems (interstitial lung \ndisease) when using Topotecan Eagle; \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\n- if you have unusual bruising or bleeding; \n- if you are feeling very ill. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using \nTopotecan Eagle. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Topotecan Eagle can \naffect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Topotecan \nEagle works. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n- Topotecan Eagle should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. If you are \n\npregnant or think you might be pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. \n- Women who could get pregnant should use contraception to stop them getting pregnant during \n\ntreatment. \n- Men having Topotecan Eagle who wish to father a child should ask their doctor for family \n\nplanning advice. \n- Do not breast-feed while using Topotecan Eagle. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTopotecan Eagle can make you feel tired or weak. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE TOPOTECAN EAGLE \n \nHow much you will be given \nYour dose of Topotecan Eagle will depend on: \n- the disease being treated \n- the size of your body (measured in ‘square meters’ or ‘m2’) \n- the results of blood tests before and during treatment \n- how well your body responds to the medicine. \n \nSmall cell lung cancer \n- The usual dose is 1.5 mg of the medicine for each square meter of your body. \n- It is given once each day for 5 days. \n- This treatment cycle will normally be repeated every 3 weeks. \n \nCervical cancer \n- The usual dose is 0.75 mg of the medicine for each square meter of your body. \n- It is given once each day for 3 days. \n- This treatment cycle will normally be repeated every 3 weeks. \n \nFor cervical cancer Topotecan Eagle will be used with another medicine called cisplatin. For more \ninformation about cisplatin, please read its Package Leaflet. \n\nThe experience of using Topotecan Eagle in children is limited. This means that treatment is not \nrecommended.  \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nHow Topotecan Eagle is prepared \nTopotecan Eagle is supplied as a concentrate for solution for infusion. The concentration of topotecan \nis higher (3 mg/ml) than with other topotecan products.

You may need \nurgent medical treatment: \n\n• Infections (very common) – because Topotecan Eagle may reduce your ability to fight infections. \nThe signs include:  \n\n- fever \n- sudden decline of your general health \n- sore throat or burning sensation when passing water \n- severe stomach pain, fever and possibly diarrhoea (rarely with blood in it) - these can be signs \n\nof bowel inflammation (neutropenic colitis). \n\n• Lung inflammation (rare), with signs such as: \n- difficulty in breathing \n- cough \n- fever. \nYou are more likely to get severe lung problems (interstitial lung disease) if you already have lung \nproblems or have had lung problems before from using other medicines or radiation. \n \nOther side effects may include: \nVery common \n- feeling generally weak and tired. These may be signs of a drop in the number of your red blood \n\ncells (anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood transfusion. \n- unusual bruising or bleeding, sometimes severe. This is caused by a drop in the number of blood \n\nclotting cells (platelets). \n- abnormally low white blood cell count (neutropenia) which may be accompanied with fever and \n\nsigns of infection (febrile neutropenia) \n- weight loss and loss of appetite, feeling tired or weak \n- feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, stomach pain, constipation \n- inflammation and ulcers of the mouth, throat, tongue or gums (mucositis) \n- high body temperature (fever) \n- infections \n- hair loss. \n \nCommon \n- mild allergic reactions (including rash) \n- yellow skin (jaundice) caused by liver problems \n- itching (pruritus) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl P\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\n- severe infection (sepsis) \n- feeling unwell (malaise). \n \nRare \n- severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions causing swelling of the lips, face or neck leading to \n\nsevere difficulty in breathing, skin rash or hives, anaphylactic shock (a severe reduction in \nblood pressure, paleness, agitation, weak pulse, decreased consciousness) \n\n- sudden swelling of the skin and mucosa (e.g. throat or tongue) caused by fluid build up \n(angioedema) \n\n- itchy rash (or hives). \n \nVery rare \n- Mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection due to accidental administration of the \n\nmedicinal product into the surrounding tissue (extravasation) e.g. by leakage. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or nurse. \n \nIf you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine \n(cisplatin) that you will be given along with Topotecan Eagle. \n \n \n5.
