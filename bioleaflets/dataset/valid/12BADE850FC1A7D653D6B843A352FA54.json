NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFORSTEO 20 micrograms/80 microliters solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach dose of 80 microliters contains 20 micrograms of teriparatide*. \nOne pre-filled pen of 2.4 mL contains 600 micrograms of teriparatide (corresponding to \n250 micrograms per mL).  \n \n*Teriparatide, rhPTH(1-34), produced in E. coli, using recombinant DNA technology, is identical to \nthe 34 N-terminal amino acid sequence of endogenous human parathyroid hormone.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nColourless, clear solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFORSTEO is indicated in adults. \nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see \nsection 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-\nvertebral fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and \nmen at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of FORSTEO is 20 micrograms administered once daily. \n \nThe maximum total duration of treatment with FORSTEO should be 24 months (see section 4.4). The \n24-month course of FORSTEO should not be repeated over a patient\u2019s lifetime. \n \nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D supplements if dietary intake is \ninadequate. \n \nFollowing cessation of FORSTEO therapy, patients may be continued on other osteoporosis therapies. \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nFORSTEO must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3.). In patients \nwith moderate renal impairment, FORSTEO should be used with caution. No special caution is \nrequired for patients with mild renal impairment. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo data are available in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.3). Therefore, \nFORSTEO should be used with caution. \n \nPaediatric population and young adults with open epiphyses \nThe safety and efficacy of FORSTEO in children and adolescents less than 18 years has not been \nestablished. FORSTEO should not be used in paediatric patients (less than 18 years), or young adults \nwith open epiphyses. \n \nElderly patients \nDosage adjustment based on age is not required (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nFORSTEO should be administered once daily by subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen. \n \nPatients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques (see section 6.6). A user manual is also \navailable to instruct patients on the correct use of the pen. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u2022 Pre-existing hypercalcaemia  \n\u2022 Severe renal impairment  \n\u2022 Metabolic bone diseases (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget\u2019s disease of the bone) other \n\nthan primary osteoporosis or glucorticoid-induced osteoporosis.  \n\u2022 Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase \n\u2022 Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton  \n\u2022 Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases should be excluded from treatment with \n\nteriparatide. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSerum and urine calcium \nIn normocalcaemic patients, slight and transient elevations of serum calcium concentrations have been \nobserved following teriparatide injection. Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 4 \nand 6 hours and return to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose of teriparatide. Therefore, if blood \nsamples for serum calcium measurements are taken, this should be done at least 16 hours after the \nmost recent FORSTEO injection. Routine calcium monitoring during therapy is not required. \n \nFORSTEO may cause small increases in urinary calcium excretion, but the incidence of hypercalciuria \ndid not differ from that in the placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. \n \nUrolithiasis \nFORSTEO has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. FORSTEO should be used with \ncaution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this \ncondition. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \nIn short-term clinical studies with FORSTEO, isolated episodes of transient orthostatic hypotension \nwere observed. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within \na few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the \nfirst several doses, was relieved by placing subjects in a reclining position, and did not preclude \ncontinued treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nRenal impairment \nCaution should be exercised in patients with moderate renal impairment. \n \nYounger adult population \nExperience in the younger adult population, including premenopausal women, is limited (see section \n5.1).  Treatment should only be initiated if the benefit clearly outweighs risks in this population. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nFORSTEO. If pregnancy occurs, FORSTEO should be discontinued. \n \nDuration of treatment \nStudies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of \nteriparatide (see section 5.3). Until further clinical data become available, the recommended treatment \ntime of 24 months should not be exceeded. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single FORSTEO dose \ndid not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that \nhypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because FORSTEO transiently increases \nserum calcium, FORSTEO should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis. \n \nFORSTEO has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No \nclinically significant interactions were noted. \n \nCo-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with FORSTEO did not alter the \neffects of FORSTEO on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nFORSTEO.  If pregnancy occurs, FORSTEO should be discontinued.   \n \nPregnancy  \nFORSTEO is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nFORSTEO is contraindicated for use during breast-feeding. It is not known whether teriparatide is \nexcreted in human milk.  \n \nFertility \nStudies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effect of teriparatide on \nhuman foetal development has not been studied. The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFORSTEO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient, \northostatic hypotension or dizziness was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from \ndriving or the use of machines until symptoms have subsided. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with FORSTEO are nausea, pain in \nlimb, headache and dizziness.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nOf patients in the teriparatide trials, 82.8 % of the FORSTEO patients and 84.5 % of the placebo \npatients reported at least 1 adverse event. \n \nThe adverse reactions associated with the use of teriparatide in osteoporosis clinical trials and post-\nmarketing exposure are summarised in the table below. The following convention has been used for \nthe classification of the adverse reactions: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000) very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: Anaemia \nImmune System Disorder \nRare: Anaphylaxis \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon: Hypercholesterolaemia \nUncommon: Hypercalcaemia greater than 2.76 mmol/L, hyperuricemia  \nRare: Hypercalcaemia greater than 3.25 mmol/L \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Dizziness, headache, sciatica, syncope \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Palpitations \nUncommon: Tachycardia \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea \nUncommon: Emphysema \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease \nUncommon: Haemorrhoids \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Sweating increased \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: Pain in limb \nCommon: Muscle cramps \nUncommon: Myalgia, arthralgia, back cramp/pain* \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon: Urinary incontinence, polyuria, micturition urgency, nephrolithiasis \nRare:  Renal failure/impairment \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: Fatigue, chest pain, asthenia, mild and transient injection site events, including pain, \nswelling, erythema, localised bruising, pruritis and minor bleeding at injection site. \nUncommon: Injection site erythema, injection site reaction \nRare: Possible allergic events soon after injection: acute dyspnoea, oro/facial oedema, generalised \nurticaria, chest pain, oedema (mainly peripheral).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\nInvestigations \nUncommon: Weight increased, cardiac murmur, alkaline phosphatase increase \n*Serious cases of back cramp or pain have been reported within minutes of the injection. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials the following reactions were reported at a \u2265 1 % difference in frequency from placebo: \nvertigo, nausea, pain in limb, dizziness, depression, dyspnoea. \n \nFORSTEO increases serum uric acid concentrations.  In clinical trials, 2.8 % of FORSTEO patients \nhad serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 0.7 % of placebo \npatients.  However, the hyperuricemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis. \n \nIn a large clinical trial, antibodies that cross-reacted with teriparatide were detected in 2.8 % of women \nreceiving FORSTEO.  Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and \ndiminished after withdrawal of therapy.  There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic \nreactions, effects on serum calcium, or effects on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) response. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \nFORSTEO has been administered in single doses of up to 100 micrograms and in repeated doses of up \nto 60 micrograms/day for 6 weeks.  \n \nThe effects of overdose that might be expected include delayed hypercalcaemia and risk of orthostatic \nhypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache can also occur. \n \nOverdose experience based on post-marketing spontaneous reports \nIn post-marketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication error where the entire \ncontents (up to 800 mcg) of the teriparatide pen have been administered as a single dose.  Transient \nevents reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension.  In some cases, no adverse \nevents occurred as a result of the overdose.  No fatalities associated with overdose have been reported. \n \nOverdose management \nThere is no specific antidote for FORSTEO. Treatment of suspected overdose should include \ntransitory discontinuation of FORSTEO, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of \nappropriate supportive measures, such as hydration. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH05 AA02. \n \nMechanism of action  \nEndogenous 84-amino-acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and \nphosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. FORSTEO (rhPTH(1-34)) is the active fragment (1-34) of \nendogenous human parathyroid hormone. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone \nformation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nabsorption of calcium and increasing the tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate \nby the kidney.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nFORSTEO is a bone formation agent to treat osteoporosis. The skeletal effects of FORSTEO depend \nupon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of FORSTEO increases apposition \nof new bone on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic \nactivity over osteoclastic activity.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nRisk Factors \n \nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fracture, family \nhistory of hip fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \nidentify women and men at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment. \n \nPremenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for \nfracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk \nfor fracture (e.g., low bone density [e.g., T score \u2264\u22122], sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy \n[e.g., \u22657.5 mg/day for at least 6 months], high underlying disease activity, low sex steroid levels). \n \nPostmenopausal osteoporosis \n \nThe pivotal study included 1637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, ninety \npercent of the patients had one or more vertebral fractures, and on average, vertebral BMD was \n0.82 g/cm2 (equivalent to a T-score = - 2.6). All patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and at \nleast 400 IU vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median: 19 months) treatment with \nFORSTEO demonstrate statistically significant fracture reduction (Table 1). To prevent one or more \nnew vertebral fractures, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months. \n \nTable 1 \n \n\nFracture Incidence in Postmenopausal Women:  \n \n\n Placebo \n(N = 544) (%) \n\nFORSTEO \n(N = 541) (%) \n\nRelative risk  \n(95% CI)  \n\nvs. placebo \nNew vertebral \nfracture (\u22651) a \n\n14.3 5.0 b 0.35 \n(0.22, 0.55) \n\nMultiple vertebral \nfractures (\u22652) a \n\n4.9 1.1 b 0.23 \n(0.09, 0.60) \n\nNon-vertebral \nfragility fractures c \n\n5.5% 2.6% d 0.47 \n(0.25, 0.87) \n\nMajor non-vertebral \nfragility fracturesc \n(hip, radius, humerus, \nribs and pelvis) \n\n3.9% 1.5% d 0.38 \n(0.17, 0.86) \n\nAbbreviations:  N = number of patients randomly assigned to each treatment group; CI = Confidence Interval. \n \n\n a The incidence of vertebral fractures was assessed in 448 placebo and 444 Forsteo patients who had baseline and follow-up \nspine radiographs. \n b p\u22640.001 compared with placebo \nc A significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures has not been demonstrated \nd p\u22640.025 compared with placebo. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nAfter 19 months (median) treatment, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the lumbar spine \nand total hip, respectively, by 9 % and 4 % compared with placebo (p<0.001). \n \nPost-treatment management: Following treatment with FORSTEO, 1262 postmenopausal women from \nthe pivotal trial enrolled in a post-treatment follow-up study. The primary objective of the study was to \ncollect safety data of FORSTEO. During this observational period, other osteoporosis treatments were \nallowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures was performed. \n \nDuring a median of 18 months following discontinuation of FORSTEO, there was a 41 % reduction \n(p=0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one new vertebral \nfracture.  \n \nIn an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture \nwithin the previous 3 years (83 % had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with \nFORSTEO for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine, total \nhip and femoral neck BMD was 10.5 %, 2.6 % and 3.9 % respectively. The mean increase in BMD \nfrom 18 to 24 months was 1.4 %, 1.2 %, and 1.6 % at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, \nrespectively. \n \nA 24-month, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1,360 \npostmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 subjects were randomised to Forsteo and \n680 subjects were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a mean age \nof 72.1 years and a median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received previous \nbisphosphonate therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 1,013 (74.5%) \npatients completed the 24-month follow-up. The mean (median) cumulative dose of glucocorticoid \nwas 474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate arm. The mean \n(median) vitamin D intake for the teriparatide arm was 1433 IU/day (1400 IU/day) and for the \nrisedronate arm was 1191 IU/day (900 IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and follow-up \nspine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in Forsteo- and 64/533 \n(12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.29-0.68), P<0.0001. The \ncumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non vertebral fractures) was \n4.8% in Forsteo and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients, hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), \nP=0.0009. \n \nMale osteoporosis   \n \n437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for men with hypogonadal (defined \nas low morning free testosterone or an elevated FSH or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis. Baseline spinal \nand femoral neck bone mineral density mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively.  At baseline, \n35 % of patients had a vertebral fracture and 59 % had a non-vertebral fracture. \n \nAll patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar \nspine BMD significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar \nspine and total hip by 5 % and 1 %, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant \neffect on fracture rates was demonstrated. \n \nGlucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis \n \nThe efficacy of FORSTEO in men and women (N=428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid \ntherapy (equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone for at least 3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-\nmonth primary phase of a 36 month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study \n(alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight percent of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral \nfractures at baseline. All patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and 800 IU vitamin D per \nday. \nThis study included postmenopausal women (N=277), premenopausal women (N=67), and men \n(N=83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine \nBMD T score of \u22122.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34 % had one or more \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\nradiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar \nspine BMD T score of \u22122.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9 % had one or \nmore radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD \nT score of \u22122.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24 % had one or more \nradiographic vertebral fractures.  \n \nSixty-nine percent of patients completed the 18-month primary phase.  At the 18 month endpoint, \nFORSTEO significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2 %) compared with alendronate (3.4 %) \n(p<0.001). FORSTEO increased BMD at the total hip (3.6 %) compared with alendronate (2.2 %) \n(p<0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7 %) compared with alendronate (2.1 %) (p<0.05). In \npatients treated with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 \nand 24 months by an additional 1.7 %, 0.9 %, and 0.4 %, respectively.  \n \nAt 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate patients and 173 FORSTEO patients \nshowed that 13 patients in the alendronate group (7.7 %) had experienced a new vertebral fracture \ncompared with 3 patients in the FORSTEO group (1.7 %) (p=0.01). In addition, 15 of 214 patients in \nthe alendronate group (7.0 %) had experienced a non-vertebral fracture compared with 16 of 214 \npatients in the FORSTEO group (7.5 %) (p=0.84). \n \nIn premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to 18 month endpoint was significantly \ngreater in the FORSTEO group compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine (4.2 % \nversus \u22121.9 %; p<0.001) and total hip (3.8 % versus 0.9 %; p=0.005).  However, no significant effect \non fracture rates was demonstrated.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life of FORSTEO is approximately 1 \nhour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the \ninjection site.  \n \nBiostransformation \nNo metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with FORSTEO but the peripheral \nmetabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. \n \nElimination \nFORSTEO is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in women \nand 94 L/hr in men). \n \nElderly  \nNo differences in FORSTEO pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 85 \nyears). Dosage adjustment based on age is not required. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nTeriparatide was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. It produced no teratogenic effects in rats, \nmice or rabbits. There were no important effects observed in pregnant rats or mice administered \nteriparatide at daily doses of 30 to 1000 \u00b5g/kg. However, fetal resorption and reduced litter size \noccurred in pregnant rabbits administered daily doses of 3 to 100 \u00b5g/kg. The embryotoxicity observed \nin rabbits may be related to their much greater sensitivity to the effects of PTH on blood ionised \ncalcium compared with rodents.  \n \nRats treated with near-life time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and \nincreased incidence of osteosarcoma most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Teriparatide did \nnot increase the incidence of any other type of neoplasia in rats. Due to the differences in bone \nphysiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings is probably minor. No bone \ntumours were observed in ovariectomised monkeys treated for 18 months or during a 3-year follow-up \n\n\n\n \n\n 10 \n\nperiod after treatment cessation. In addition, no osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials or \nduring the post treatment follow-up study.  \n \nAnimal studies have shown that severely reduced hepatic blood flow decreases exposure of PTH to the \nprincipal cleavage system (Kupffer cells) and consequently clearance of PTH(1-84). \n \n \n6.
