This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMACI 500,000 to 1,000,000 cells/cm2 implantation matrix \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach implant contains matrix applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocytes. \n \n2.1 General description \n \nCharacterised viable autologous chondrocytes expanded ex vivo expressing chondrocyte-specific marker \ngenes, seeded onto a CE marked porcine derived Type I/III collagen membrane. \n \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n \nEach implantation matrix consists of characterised autologous chondrocytes on a 14.5 cmÂ² Type I/III \ncollagen membrane, at a density of 500,000 to 1,000,000 cells per cm2, to be trimmed by the surgeon to \nthe size and shape of the defect. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nImplantation matrix. \n \nThe implant is an opaque, off-white membrane, seeded with chondrocytes, supplied in 18 ml of \ncolourless solution in a dish. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMACI is indicated for the repair of symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee (grade III \nand IV of the Modified Outerbridge Scale) of 3-20 cm2 in skeletally mature adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMACI is intended for autologous use only. \n \nMACI must be administered by a surgeon specifically trained and qualified in the use of MACI. Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \nPosology \n \nThe amount of MACI administered is dependent upon the size (surface in cm2) of the cartilage defect. \nThe implantation matrix is trimmed by the treating surgeon to the size and shape of the defect, to ensure \nthe damaged area is completely covered, and implanted cell-side down. The administered dose \ncorresponds to 500,000 to 1,000,000 autologous cells/cm2 of implantation matrix. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder people (over 65 years of age) \n \nThe use of MACI in this age group has not been studied. The use of MACI in elderly with generalised \ndegeneration of the cartilage or osteoarthritis is not recommended.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of MACI in children less than 18 years of age have not been established.  \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n  \nFor implantation. \n \nThe defect bed should be debrided only down to the subchondral plate and not through it. Bleeding \nthrough the subchondral plate should be avoided, but if it occurs, it must be controlled. Epinephrine or \nfibrin sealant (see section 4.5), applied sparingly directly to bleeding points, is a suitable haemostatic \nagent. \n \nImplantation of MACI is performed using sterile surgical techniques and requires both the preparation of \nthe defect bed and the application of fibrin sealant to the base and rim of the defect in order to secure the \nimplant. At the surgeonâs discretion, a few interrupted absorbable sutures may also be used to provide \nextra security. \nThe implantation should be followed by an appropriate rehabilitation schedule (see section 4.4). \n \nFor information on preparation and handling of MACI, please refer to section 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nâ¢ Hypersensitivity to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or porcine products, or any residual \ncomponent carried over from manufacture of MACI, including bovine serum, and gentamicin. \n\n \nâ¢ Severe osteoarthritis of the knee. \n\n \nâ¢ Inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory joint disease, or uncorrected congenital blood coagulation \n\ndisorders. \n \n\nâ¢ Patients with a femoral epiphyseal growth plate that is not fully closed. \n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nMACI is an autologous implant and must only be administered to the patient for whom it was \nmanufactured. Implantation of MACI is to be performed during arthrotomy under sterile conditions. \nThere is limited experience with delivery of MACI to the knee via arthroscopy, however, arthroscopic \ntechniques may be used to apply MACI at the discretion of the treating physician. \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nPatients with local inflammations or active infections in the bone, joint, and surrounding soft tissue \nshould be temporarily deferred until documented recovery.  \n \nIn the pivotal study of MACI, patients were excluded if they had a history of osteoarthritis \n(Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 or 4) in the target knee, or concomitant inflammatory disease. \n \nTo create a favourable environment for healing, concomitant pathologies must be addressed prior to or \nconcurrent with implantation of MACI. These include: \n \n\nâ¢ Meniscal pathology: unstable or torn meniscus requires repair, replacement, or partial \nmeniscectomy.  MACI is not recommended in patients with a total menisectomy unless the \nmeniscal deficiency can be addressed with a staged or concurrent meniscal graft. \n\n \nâ¢ Cruciate ligament instability: the joint should not possess excessive laxity. Both anterior and \n\nposterior cruciate ligaments should be stable or undergo reconstruction to reduce shearing forces \nand rotation stresses across the joint.  \n\n \nâ¢ Malalignment: the tibio-femoral joint should be properly aligned. Abnormal varus or valgus \n\nloading of the tibio-femoral joint may jeopardise the implant and should be addressed with a \ncorrective osteotomy or similar procedure. When treating trochlear and patellar defects, \nabnormal patellar tracking must be corrected, prior to or concurrent with MACI implantation.  \n\n \nPost-operative haemarthrosis occurs mainly in patients with a predisposition to haemorrhage or poor \nsurgical haemorrhage control. The patientâs haemostatic functions should be screened prior to surgery. \nThromboprophylaxis should be administered according to local guidelines. \n \nLocal treatment guidelines regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis around orthopaedic surgery should \nbe followed. \n \nDue to limited experience, the use of MACI in joints other than the knee is not recommended. \n \nMACI is shipped following a validated rapid microbial sterility assay to determine absence of microbial \ngrowth.  Final sterility test results are not available at the time of shipping. If positive sterility results are \nobtained, the treating physician will be contacted to discuss either cancellation of the implantation or a \nplan of action based on the patient-specific circumstances and risk assessment.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nRehabilitation \n \nControlled physiotherapy, including early mobilisation, range-of-motion exercises, and partial weight-\nbearing is recommended as soon as possible to promote graft maturation and to reduce the risk of post-\noperative thromboembolic events and joint stiffness. Following implantation, the patient should follow \nan appropriately controlled, phased rehabilitation  programme as recommended by the treating physician \nbased on the MACI Rehabilitation Manual. This should include specified or staged physical activity in \norder to minimise the likelihood of arthrofibrosis and graduated partial weight-bearing. Return to \nsporting activity should be personalised in consultation with healthcare professionals. \n \nCases in which MACI cannot be supplied \n \nIn some cases, it may occur that source chondrocytes of the patient are not expandable or that the release \ncriteria (see section 6.6) are not met due to poor biopsy quality, patient characteristics, or manufacturing \nfailure.  Therefore, it may occur that MACI cannot be delivered.   \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFibrin sealants containing formaldehyde must not be used with MACI, since formaldehyde is cytotoxic to \nthe chondrocytes. \n \nWhile oral use of pain medication is recommended for post-surgical pain relief, intra-articular \nadministration of analgesics is not recommended as studies have shown adverse effects on articular \ncartilage and chondrocytes with exposure. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nLimited clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Conventional reproductive and \ndevelopmental toxicity studies are not considered relevant, given the nature and the intended clinical use \nof the medicinal product. Given the local nature of the medicinal product, adverse reactions of MACI on \npregnancy are not anticipated. However as MACI will be implanted using invasive surgical techniques, it \nis not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nThere are no data on the use of MACI during breast-feeding. Given the local nature of the product, \nadverse reactions of MACI on the nursing infant are not anticipated. However as MACI will be \nimplanted using invasive surgical techniques, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding taking into account the benefits of treatment for the woman and the risk to the infant. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on possible effects of MACI treatment on fertility. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDue to the surgical nature of the underlying procedure, implantation with MACI has a major influence on \nthe ability to drive and use machines. During the rehabilitation period that follows MACI treatment \npatients should refer to their treating physician and follow their advice. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on the exposure of more than 6,000 patients  to MACI treatment in the knee, complications may \nbe related to the arthrotomy procedure, general complications related to surgical intervention, other knee \npathology (such as ligamentous or meniscal pathology), or the biopsy procurement. Complications \nrelated to knee surgery in general may also include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  \nOther complications have been identified as causally related to MACI. The following important risks \nhave been identified related to either MACI or peri-operative complications:  \n \nRelated to MACI: \n \n\nâ¢ Symptomatic graft hypertrophy \nâ¢ Graft delamination (complete or partial, possibly leading to loose bodies in the joint or graft \n\nfailure) \n \nPeri-operative complications related to surgical intervention of the knee: \n \n\nâ¢ Haemarthrosis \nâ¢ Arthrofibrosis \nâ¢ Localised surgical site inflammation \nâ¢ Localised surgical site infection \nâ¢ Thromboembolic events \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. Frequencies are defined according to \nthe following convention: very common (â¥ 1/10); common (â¥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (â¥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100); rare (â¥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \nSystem organ class \n \n\nUncommon Rare \n\nInfections and infestations  Infective  arthritis  \nWound infection  \nLocalised infection \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Arthrofibrosis  \nSynovitis \nTendonitis  \nHaemarthrosis \nArthralgia \nJoint effusion \nJoint swelling \nJoint stiffness  \nBone oedema  \nJoint range-of-motion decreased  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Inflammation \nHyperthermia \nPyrexia  \nImplant site oedema \n\nInvestigations  C-reactive protein increased  \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nGraft delamination \nGraft complication  \nGraft hypertrophy \n\nGraft loss  \nCartilage injury  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGraft delamination: \n \nGraft delamination refers to a loosening, either partial or total, of the graft from the subchondral bone and \nfrom the surrounding cartilage. A total graft delamination is a serious complication and the patient may \nexperience locking, pain, and swelling after an acute distortion of the knee. \n \nRisk factors for graft delamination can include but are not limited to poor patient selection, poor \nadherence to recommended surgical technique, failure to address concomitant pathologies, poor \ncompliance with the rehabilitation protocol or post-operative trauma to the knee. \n \nGraft hypertrophy: \n \nSymptomatic graft hypertrophy is acomplication that may occur with MACI.  \n \nSymptoms may include catching or pain. There are no known risk groups or specific risk factors for graft \nhypertrophy in patients treated with MACI. Patients may require debridement of the hypertrophic tissue \nvia arthroscopy. \n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNot applicable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Medicines for Disorders of the Musculo-Skeletal system, ATC code: \nM09AX02  \n \nClinical pharmacology studies have not been conducted on MACI.  Current clinical and nonclinical \nevidence suggests that delivery of autologous chondrocytes on the collagen membrane promotes \nproliferation and re-differentiation of seeded cells, and may result in synthesis of hyaline-like cartilage \nrepair tissue. \n \nMACI has been investigated in a parallel, randomised, open-label trial in 144 patients with Outerbridge \nGrade III or IV focal cartilage defects of the knee of 3-20 cm2 (median 4 cm2).  Seventy-two patients \nreceived MACI, and 72 were treated with microfracture. The median age of patients was 34 to 35 years \n(age range: 18 to 54), and the mean body mass index was 26. The majority of patients had undergone at \nleast 1 prior orthopaedic knee surgery. MACI was superior compared to microfracture regarding the \nimprovement of pain and function according to the KOOS scale (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome \nScore). See responder rates in Table 1 below.  \n \nFour patients were treatment failures in the microfracture treatment arm, versus one in the MACI \ntreatment arm. There were no significant differences observed in the structural markers of cartilage repair \nbetween both treatments, as assessed by International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) II overall \nassessment histology scores of biopsies, and MRI defect fill scores.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1:  KOOS Response Rate*: Full Analysis Set \n\nn (%) \n MACI  \n\nN=72 \nMicrofracture \n\nN=72 p-value  \nVisit 10 (Week 104) Stratified by \ncentre \n\n    \n\nResponded  63 (87.50) 49 (68.06) 0.016  \nNot Responded  9 (12.50) 20 (27.78)  \nMissing  0 3 (4.17)  \n\nVisit 10 (Week 104) Unstratified     \nResponded  62 (86.11) 48 (66.67) 0.011 \nNot Responded  7 (9.72) 18 (25.00)  \nMissing  3 (4.17) 6 (8.33)  \n\n* KOOS Response Rate: Responder is defined as an improvement of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis \nOutcome Score from baseline of minimal 10 points of a scale of 100. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with MACI \nin paediatric patients from the closure of the femoral epiphyseal growth plate to less than 18 years of age. \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTypical clinical pharmacokinetic (ADME) studies have not been performed on MACI. The \npharmacokinetic behaviour of MACI is related to the resorption of the collagen membrane, a proteolytic \nprocess performed by cells in the vicinity of the defects. The membrane is resorbed over the months \nfollowing implantation.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data based on implantation of MACI in rabbits and horses did not reveal any special hazard \nfor humans. \n \nNon-clinical in vitro investigations have shown that the collagen membrane is non-cytotoxic, non-\nmutagenic, non-reactive (short- and long-term implantation), non-sensitising, a negligible irritant, and \nnon-toxic (acute systemic).  \n \nA rabbit study demonstrated that at 3 months post-implantation, minimal numbers of inflammatory cells \nwere present in the vicinity of the defect, with variable chondrogenesis.  In a horse study, signs of a \nminor inflammatory response, characterised by a slight increase in synovial fluid volume and a mild \nlymphoid accumulation in the synovium, were observed at 3 months. By 6 months, these signals had \nsubsided, resulting in a normal synovial appearance. There were no indications of gross inflammatory \nreaction. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n6.

Do not refrigerate or freeze. Store shipping box in an \narea below 37Â°C.  \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container and special requirement for use, administration or \n\nimplantation \n \nMACI is shipped in custom-designed, sterile, sealed, clear polystyrene dishes.  \n \nEach dish contains 1 implantation matrix, held in place by a green polycarbonate x-ring and closed with a \ngreen polycarbonate cover for shipment.  \n \nEach dish is sealed in a gamma-irradiated clear plastic bag. \n \nMACI is supplied in 1 to 2 dishes, which are placed into a 95kPa pouch (outer bag) with absorbent \nmaterial for transport.  \n \nThis package is enclosed in an outer carton insulated with ambient gel packs. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDuring the first procedure, a sample of healthy cartilage tissue (a biopsy) will be taken from the affected \njoint by an arthrotomy or arthroscopy.  \n \nThe biopsy will be sent to the cell processing facility. At the cell processing facility, the cartilage cells \nwill be grown aseptically in culture to expand the number of cells and placed onto a sterile CE marked \nporcine derived type I/III collagen membrane, to make MACI. MACI will be released following M\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n au\nth\n\nor\nise\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nsuccessful results from assays which assess chondrocyte viability, identity, potency, minimum cell \nnumber, endotoxin, pre-release sterility, and mycoplasma. \n \nMACI will be sent to the treatment facility. At this time, MACI will be implanted into the cartilage \ndefect in the affected joint via a second procedure. The MACI implant will be secured in place using a \nfibrin sealant.  \n \nThe timing between the removal of the biopsy and MACI implantation can vary depending on logistical \nfactors in addition to the quality and number of cells obtained from the biopsy. The minimum amount of \ntime is 6 weeks; however, cells can also be cryopreserved and held in storage for up to 24 months until a \nsurgical date is established. \n \nThe surgeon will organise the date for MACI implantation in consultation with the Marketing \nAuthorisation Holder (MAH) or its local representative. In rare cases the MAH will not be able to \nproduce a MACI implant from the available cells. If this occurs, the surgeon will advise the patient on \nthe best course of action. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of as surgical waste in accordance \nwith local requirements. \n \nPlease consult the Surgical Technique Manual for further information. \n \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n7.

What MACI is and what it is used for \n \nMACI is used in adults to repair cartilage defects in your knee joint. Cartilage is a tissue that is present in \nevery joint in the body; it protects the ends of bones and allows joints to function smoothly. \n \nMACI is an implant consisting of a porcine derived (derived from pigs) collagen membrane which \ncontains your own cartilage cells (called autologous chondrocytes) and is implanted into your knee. \nâAutologousâ means that your own cells are used which have been taken from your knee (through a \nbiopsy) and grown outside the body.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use MACI \n \nDo NOT use MACI if you: \n \n\nâ¢ are allergic to any of the ingredients of MACI (listed in section 6), or porcine products (derived \nfrom pigs), bovine serum (a protein derived from cows) or gentamicin (an antibiotic)  \n\nâ¢ have severe osteoarthritis of the knee (disease of the joints with pain and swelling) \nâ¢ currently suffer from inflammatory arthritis or inflammatory joint disease of the knee \nâ¢ have a known, uncorrected bleeding disorder \nâ¢ have a growth plate of the knee that is not fully closed. \n\n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nYour MACI implant has been manufactured specifically for you and cannot be administered to any other \npatient. \n \nMACI should be implanted in a reasonably healthy joint. This means that other problems in the joint \nshould be corrected before or during MACI implantation. \n \nIf you have a sudden occurrence or recent history of bone or joint infections, your MACI treatment \nshould be temporarily delayed until your doctor considers that you have recovered. \n \nTell your doctor or surgeon if you know you have a predisposition for bleeding or poor bleeding control \nfollowing surgical procedures.  \n \nYou may also be given antibiotics or pain-killers to help reduce some of the side effects.  \n \nIt is important that you closely follow the rehabilitation programme recommended by your doctor. Please \ndiscuss with your doctor or physical therapist when to re-start specific physical activities. \n \nYour surgeon will give you more information on any special considerations for your particular case. \n \nOther situations in which MACI cannot be given \n \nEven if the surgeon has already taken a small sample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) needed to produce the \nMACI implant, it is possible that you will not be eligible for treatment with MACI.   \nThis is the case if: \n \n\nâ¢ the biopsy is of insufficient quality to produce MACI for you \nâ¢ the cells cannot be grown in the laboratory  \nâ¢ the increased cells do not meet all the quality requirements.  \n\n \nIn such situations, your surgeon will be informed and might have to select an alternative treatment for \nyou. \n \nOlder people \n \nThe use of MACI is not recommended in patients over 65 years of age who have generalised \ndegeneration of the cartilage or osteoarthritis (disease of the joints with pain and swelling). \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThe use of MACI is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and MACI \n \nPlease tell your doctor, surgeon or physical therapist if you are taking or have recently taken any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nAsk your doctor or surgeon for more information as to which pain medicine you can safely use.  \nAdministration of pain relievers into the joint is not recommended.

Depending on your particular situation, your \ndoctor or surgeon will advise you on whether or not to continue breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe surgical procedure will have a major impact on your ability to drive and use machines.  \nDriving and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period, and the advice of your \ndoctor, surgeon or physical therapist should be strictly followed during this period. \n \n \n3. How to use MACI \n \nMACI must only be implanted by surgeons who have been specifically trained for this kind of surgery.  \n \nA small amount of blood (4 ml) will be taken by a qualified person for testing.  \n \nYou will need to have two surgical procedures to receive this treatment: \n \n\n1. During the first procedure, a sample of healthy cartilage cells (a biopsy) will be taken from your \njoint by arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Your surgeon will explain what arthrotomy and athroscopy \nprocedures are. \n\n \nThe biopsy will be sent to the cell processing facility. At the cell processing facility, your \ncartilage cells will be grown aseptically (free from germs) in culture, to increase the number of \ncells, and placed onto a sterile collagen membrane to make MACI. \n\n \n2. The final MACI implant will be sent back to your surgeon. The MACI will then be implanted \n\ninto the cartilage defect in your joint by a second procedure. MACI will be secured in place \nusing a fibrin sealant. A fibrin sealant is a type of glue that is made from human blood-clotting \nproteins. \n\n \nThe length of time between your biopsy and the implantation of MACI can vary depending on the \nprocedure date and the quality and number of cells in the biopsy. On average this will be 6 weeks, \nhowever, cells can also be frozen and held in storage for up to 2 years until a convenient date for surgery \nis agreed between you and your surgeon. Your surgeon will organise the date for implantation. \nIn rare cases the cell processing facility will not be able to produce MACI from your cells. If this \nhappens, your surgeon will advise you on the best course of action. \n \nYour doctor will discuss with you the specific rehabilitation programme that follows your surgery. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, MACI can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nWhen you receive MACI, you may experience side effects soon after the implantation. These effects will \ngradually reduce over time. \n \nYour doctor may give you other medicines to help reduce any side effects (see section 2 âWarnings \nand precautionsâ). \n \nComplications may be related to MACI or to the surgical procedure, or both. Complications related to \nknee surgery in general may include deep vein thrombosis (blood clotting in a deep vein) and pulmonary \nembolism (blood clotting in the lung due to blockage of a lung artery).  If you notice any of the \nfollowing, please contact your doctor immediately, since these may be symptoms of blood clotting: \n\nâ¢ difficulty breathing, chest pain and palpitations \nâ¢ leg swelling, leg pain and redness \n\n \nRisks involved with implantation of MACI:  \n \nThe following uncommon side effect may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n \n\nâ¢ too much cartilage growth. \nâ¢ the graft may detach completely or partially from the defect in the joint. You may require \n\nmore surgery to correct this \n \nRisks involved with arthrotomy or arthroscopy or MACI  \n \nAll surgical procedures carry a certain risk. Your surgeon can explain these to you.   \nThe following rare side effects may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people: \n \n\nâ¢ infection \nâ¢ inflammation \nâ¢ post-operative pain \nâ¢ bleeding in the joint \nâ¢ joint stiffness/numbness \nâ¢ swelling of the joint \nâ¢ fever  \n\n \nYour surgeon or anaesthetist will explain to you the risks involved with the procedures as well as any \nadditional specific risks that are applicable to you because of your medical history and current medical \nstatus. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, surgeon or physical therapist. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\nWhat MACI contains\n\nThe active substance of MACI consists of viable autologous human cartilage cells on a 14.5 cmÂ² Type \nI/III collagen membrane, at a density of between 0.5 and 1 million cells per cm2. \n\nThe other ingredients are Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 4-(2-\nHydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid sodium (HEPES). \n\nWhat MACI looks like and contents of the pack\n\nThe implant is an opaque, off-white membrane supplied in 18 ml of colourless solution in a dish.\n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder \nVericel Denmark ApS, Amaliegade 10, DK-1256 Copenhagen K, Denmark\n\nManufacturer\nGenzyme Biosurgery ApS, Oliefabriksvej 51B, DK-2770 Kastrup, Denmark\n\nThis leaflet was last revised in MM/YYYY\n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu.\n__________________________________________________________________________________ \nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:\n\nDuring the first procedure a sample of healthy cartilage cells (a biopsy) will be taken from the affected \njoint by an arthrotomy or arthroscopy.  \n Me\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe biopsy will be sent to the cell processing facility. At the cell processing facility, the cartilage cells \nwill be grown aseptically in culture to expand the number of cells and placed onto a sterile collagen \nmembrane, to make MACI. \n \nMACI will be sent back to the surgeon. At this time MACI will be implanted into the cartilage defect in \nthe affected joint via a second procedure. The MACI implant will be secured in place using a fibrin \nsealant.  \n \nThe timing between the removal of the biopsy and the implantation of the MACI implant can vary \ndepending on logistics and the quality and number of cells in the biopsy. On average this will be 6 weeks, \nhowever, cells can also be cryopreserved and held in storage for up to 2 years until a convenient date for \nsurgery is agreed between the patient and surgeon. \n \nThe surgeon will organise the date for implantation in consultation with the Marketing Authorisation \nHolder (MAH) or its local representative. In rare cases the MAH will not be able to produce a MACI \nimplant from the available cells. If this occurs the surgeon will advise the patient on the best course of \naction. \n \nPlease consult the Surgical Technique Manual for further information. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
