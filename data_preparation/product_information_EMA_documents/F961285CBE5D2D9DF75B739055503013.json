NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nEpidyolex 100 mg/ml oral solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach ml of oral solution contains 100 mg cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nEach ml of solution contains: \n\n \n\n79 mg anhydrous ethanol \n\n \n\n736 mg refined sesame oil  \n\n \n\n0.0003 mg benzyl alcohol \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nOral solution \n\n \n\nClear, colourless to yellow solution \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEpidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut \n\nsyndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age \n\nand older. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nEpidyolex should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of \n\nepilepsy. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of cannabidiol is 2.5 mg/kg taken twice daily (5 mg/kg/day) for one \n\nweek. After one week, the dose should be increased to a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(10 mg/kg/day). Based on individual clinical response and tolerability, each dose can be further \n\nincreased in weekly increments of 2.5 mg/kg administered twice daily (5 mg/kg/day) up to a \n\nmaximum recommended dose of 10 mg/kg twice daily (20 mg/kg/day).  \n\n \n\nAny dose increases above 10 mg/kg/day, up to the maximum recommended dose of 20 mg/kg/day, \n\nshould be made considering individual benefit and risk and with adherence to the full monitoring \n\nschedule (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nEach Epidyolex carton is supplied with: \n\n \n\n- Two 1 ml syringes graduated in 0.05 ml increments (each 0.05 ml increment corresponds to 5 mg \n\ncannabidiol) \n\n- Two 5 ml syringes graduated in 0.1 ml increments (each 0.1 ml increment corresponds to 10 mg \n\ncannabidiol) \n\n \n\nIf the calculated dose is 100 mg (1 ml) or less, the smaller 1 ml oral syringe should be used. \n\nIf the calculated dose is more than 100 mg (1 ml), the larger 5 ml oral syringe should be used. \n\n \n\nThe calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest graduated increment. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation \n\nIf cannabidiol has to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased gradually. In clinical trials, \n\ncannabidiol discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 10% per day for \n\n10 days (see section 4.4). A slower or faster down titration may be required, as clinically indicated, at \n\nthe discretion of the prescriber. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIn the case of one or more missed doses, the missed doses should not be compensated. Dosing should \n\nbe resumed at the existing treatment schedule. In the case of more than 7 days’ missed doses, \n\nre-titration to the therapeutic dose should be made. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cannabidiol in patients ≥ 65 years of age have not been established. \n\n \n\nIn general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of \n\nthe dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and \n\nof concomitant disease or other concurrent therapy (see sections 4.4 under hepatocellular injury and \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCannabidiol can be administered to patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment without \n\ndose adjustment (see section 5.2). There is no experience in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is \n\nnot known if cannabidiol is dialysable. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nCannabidiol does not require dose adjustment in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh A). \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh C). A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment. The dose titration should be performed as detailed in the table below. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Dose adjustments in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n\nHepatic \n\nImpairment \n\nStarting Dose Maintenance Dose Maximum Recommended Dose \n\nModerate  1.25 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(2.5 mg/kg/day) \n\n2.5 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(5 mg/kg/day) \n\n5 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(10 mg/kg/day) \n\nSevere  0.5 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(1 mg/kg/day) \n\n1 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(2 mg/kg/day) \n\n2 mg/kg twice daily \n\n(4 mg/kg/day)* \n\n*Higher doses of cannabidiol may be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment where the \n\npotential benefits outweigh the risks. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of cannabidiol in children aged below 6 months. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cannabidiol in children aged 6 months to 2 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments of other medicinal products used in combination with cannabidiol \n\nA physician experienced in treating patients who are on concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) \n\nshould evaluate the need for dose adjustments of cannabidiol or of the concomitant medicinal \n\nproduct(s) to manage potential drug interactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use \n\nFood may increase cannabidiol levels and therefore it should be taken consistently either with or \n\nwithout food, including the ketogenic diet (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to sesame oil, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPatients with transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and \n\nbilirubin greater than 2 times the ULN (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHepatocellular injury \n\n \n\nCannabidiol causes dose-related elevations of liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] \n\nand/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) (see section 4.8). The elevations typically occur in the first \n\ntwo months of treatment initiation; however, there were cases observed up to 18 months after initiation \n\nof treatment, particularly in patients taking concomitant valproate. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the majority of ALT elevations occurred in patients taking concomitant valproate. \n\nConcomitant use of clobazam also increased the incidence of transaminase elevations, although to a \n\nlesser extent than valproate. Dose adjustment or discontinuation of valproate or dose adjustment of \n\nclobazam should be considered if transaminase elevations occur.  \n\n \n\nResolution of transaminase elevations occurred with discontinuation of cannabidiol or reduction of \n\ncannabidiol and/or concomitant valproate in about two-thirds of the cases. In about one-third of the \n\ncases, transaminase elevations resolved during continued treatment with cannabidiol, without dose \n\nreduction. \n\nPatients with baseline transaminase levels above the ULN had higher rates of transaminase elevations \n\nwhen taking cannabidiol. In some patients, a synergistic effect of concomitant treatment with \n\nvalproate upon baseline elevated transaminases resulted in a higher risk of transaminase elevations. \n\n \n\nIn an uncontrolled study in patients in a different non-epilepsy indication, 2 elderly patients \n\nexperienced elevations of alkaline phosphatase levels above 2 times the ULN in combination with \n\ntransaminase elevations. The elevations resolved after discontinuation of cannabidiol.  \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\nIn general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated \n\nbilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early \n\nidentification of elevated transaminase may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with \n\nelevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, or elevations in bilirubin above 2 times \n\nthe ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of cannabidiol treatment. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nPrior to starting treatment with cannabidiol, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total \n\nbilirubin levels. \n\n \n\nRoutine Monitoring: \n\nSerum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months \n\nafter initiation of treatment with cannabidiol, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nUpon changes in cannabidiol dose above 10 mg/kg/day or changes in medicinal products (dose change \n\nor additions) that are known to impact the liver, this monitoring schedule should be restarted.  \n\n \n\nIntensified Monitoring: \n\nPatients with identified baseline elevations of ALT or AST and patients who are taking valproate \n\nshould have serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels obtained at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 \n\nmonths, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with cannabidiol, and periodically thereafter or as \n\nclinically indicated. Upon changes in cannabidiol dose above 10 mg/kg/day or changes in medicinal \n\nproducts (dose change or additions) that are known to impact the liver, this monitoring schedule \n\nshould be restarted. \n\n \n\nIf a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, serum \n\ntransaminases and total bilirubin should be promptly measured and treatment with cannabidiol should \n\nbe interrupted or discontinued, as appropriate. Cannabidiol should be discontinued in any patients with \n\nelevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than \n\n2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN \n\nshould also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases \n\nshould be evaluated for other possible causes. Dose adjustment of any co-administered medicinal \n\nproduct that is known to affect the liver should be considered (e.g., valproate and clobazam) (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nSomnolence and sedation \n\n \n\nCannabidiol can cause somnolence and sedation, which occur more commonly early in treatment and \n\nmay diminish with continued treatment. The occurrence was higher for those patients on concomitant \n\nclobazam (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can potentiate the \n\nsomnolence and sedation effect. \n\n \n\nIncreased seizure frequency \n\n \n\nAs with other AEDs, a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment \n\nwith cannabidiol, which may require adjustment in dose of cannabidiol and/or concomitant AEDs, or \n\ndiscontinuation of cannabidiol, should the benefit-risk be negative. In the phase 3 clinical trials, the \n\nobserved frequency of status epilepticus was similar between the cannabidiol and placebo groups. \n\n \n\nSuicidal behaviour and ideation \n\n \n\nSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with AEDs in several \n\nindications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with AEDs has shown a small \n\nincreased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known, and the \n\navailable data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation and appropriate treatment \n\nshould be considered. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice \n\nshould any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEthanol in the formulation \n\n \n\nEach ml of Epidyolex contains 79 mg of ethanol. The maximum recommended single dose of \n\nEpidyolex (10 mg/kg) will increase the concentration of ethanol in the body by about 13 mg/l. For an \n\nadult weighing 70 kg, this is equivalent to 14 millilitres (ml) of beer, or 6 ml of wine per dose.  \n\n \n\nEffects of alcohol in children less than 6 years old may include sleepiness, behavioural changes, and \n\nimpaired ability to concentrate and participate in school activities. \n\n \n\nThe alcohol content should be taken into account in pregnancy and high-risk groups such as patients \n\nwith liver disease. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nCYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inducers \n\n \n\nStrong inducers of CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, St. John’s wort, and/or \n\nstrong inducers of CYP2C19, such as rifampin, administered concomitantly with cannabidiol may \n\ndecrease the plasma concentrations of cannabidiol and decrease the effectiveness of cannabidiol. Dose \n\nadjustment may be necessary. \n\n \n\nUGT inhibitors \n\n \n\nCannabidiol is a substrate for UGT1A7, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. No formal drug-drug interaction \n\nstudies have been conducted with cannabidiol in combination with UGT inhibitors, therefore caution \n\nshould be taken when co-administering drugs that are known inhibitors of these UGTs. Dose reduction \n\nof cannabidiol and/or the inhibitor may be necessary when given in combination. \n\n \n\nConcomitant AED treatments \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol are complex and may cause interactions with the patient’s \n\nconcomitant AED treatments. cannabidiol and/or concomitant AED treatment should therefore be \n\nadjusted during regular medical supervision and the patient should be closely monitored for adverse \n\ndrug reactions. In addition, monitoring of plasma concentrations should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe potential for drug-drug interactions with other concomitant AEDs has been assessed in healthy \n\nvolunteers and patients with epilepsy for clobazam, valproate and stiripentol. Although no formal \n\ndrug-drug interaction studies have been performed for other AEDs, phenytoin and lamotrigine are \n\naddressed based on in vitro data. \n\n \n\nClobazam \n\nWhen cannabidiol and clobazam are co-administered, bi-directional PK interactions occur. Based on a \n\nhealthy volunteer study, elevated levels (3- to 4-fold) of N-desmethylclobazam (an active metabolite \n\nof clobazam) can occur when combined with cannabidiol, likely mediated by CYP2C19 inhibition. In \n\naddition, there was an increased exposure to 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD; an active metabolite \n\nof cannabidiol), for which plasma area under the curve (AUC) increased by 47% (see section 5.2). \n\nIncreased systemic levels of these active substances may lead to enhanced pharmacological effects and \n\nto an increase in adverse drug reactions. Concomitant use of cannabidiol and clobazam increases the \n\nincidence of somnolence and sedation compared with placebo (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Reduction in \n\ndose of clobazam should be considered if somnolence or sedation are experienced when clobazam is \n\nco-administered with cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nValproate \n\nConcomitant use of cannabidiol and valproate increases the incidence of transaminase enzyme \n\nelevations (see section 4.4). The mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. If clinically \n\nsignificant increases of transaminases occur, cannabidiol and/or concomitant valproate should be \n\nreduced or discontinued in all patients until a recovery of transaminase elevations are observed (see \n\n\n\n7 \n\nsection 4.4). Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of other \n\nhepatotoxic medicinal products and cannabidiol (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of cannabidiol and valproate increases the incidence of diarrhoea and events of \n\ndecreased appetite. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. \n\n \n\nStiripentol \n\nWhen cannabidiol was combined with stiripentol there was a minor increase in stiripentol levels of \n\n28% for Cmax and 55% for AUC. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but the patient should be \n\nclosely monitored for adverse drug reactions. \n\n \n\nPhenytoin \n\nExposure to phenytoin may be increased when it is co-administered with cannabidiol, as phenytoin is \n\nlargely metabolised via CYP2C9, which is inhibited by cannabidiol in vitro. There have not been any \n\nclinical studies formally investigating this interaction. Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic index, so \n\ncombining cannabidiol with phenytoin should be initiated with caution and if tolerability issues arise, \n\ndose reduction of phenytoin should be considered. \n\n \n\nLamotrigine \n\nLamotrigine is a substrate for UGT enzymes including UGT2B7 which is inhibited by cannabidiol in \n\nvitro. There have not been any clinical studies formally investigating this interaction. Lamotrigine \n\nlevels may be elevated when it is co-administered with cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nPotential for cannabidiol to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 Substrates \n\nIn vitro data predict drug-drug interactions with CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine), \n\nCYP2B6 substrates (e.g., bupropion, efavirenz), uridine 5' diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 \n\n(UGT1A9) (e.g., diflunisal, propofol, fenofibrate), and UGT2B7 (e.g., gemfibrozil, morphine, \n\nlorazepam) when co-administered with cannabidiol. Co-administration of cannabidiol is also predicted \n\nto cause clinically significant interactions with CYP2C8 (repaglinide) and CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin) \n\nsubstrates. \n\n \n\nIn vitro data have demonstrated that cannabidiol inhibits CYP2C19, which may cause increased \n\nplasma concentrations of medicines that are metabolised by this isoenzyme such as clobazam and \n\nomeprazole. Dose reduction should be considered for concomitant medicinal products that are \n\nsensitive CYP2C19 substrates or that have a narrow therapeutic index. \n\n \n\nBecause of potential inhibition of enzyme activity, dose reduction of substrates of UGT1A9, UGT2B7, \n\nCYP2C8, and CYP2C9 should be considered, as clinically appropriate, if adverse reactions are \n\nexperienced when administered concomitantly with cannabidiol. Because of potential for both \n\ninduction and inhibition of enzyme activity, dose adjustment of substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 \n\nshould be considered, as clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nIn vitro assessment of interaction with UGT enzymes \n\nIn vitro data suggest that cannabidiol is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated \n\nactivity at clinically relevant concentrations. The metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD) is \n\nalso an inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A4 and UGT1A6-mediated activity in vitro. Dose reduction of the \n\nsubstrates may be necessary when cannabidiol is administered concomitantly with substrates of these \n\nUGTs. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are only limited data from the use of cannabidiol in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nAs a precautionary measure, cannabidiol should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential \n\nbenefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the presence of cannabidiol or its metabolites in human milk, the effects \n\non the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown toxicological changes in lactating animals, when the mother was \n\ntreated with cannabidiol (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nThere are no human studies on excretion of cannabidiol in breast milk. Given that cannabidiol is \n\nhighly protein bound and will likely pass freely from plasma into milk, as a precaution, breast-feeding \n\nshould be discontinued during treatment. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo human data on the effect of cannabidiol on fertility are available. \n\n \n\nNo effect on reproductive ability of male or female rats was noted with an oral dose of up to \n\n150 mg/kg/day cannabidiol (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCannabidiol has major influence on the ability to drive and operate machines because it may cause \n\nsomnolence and sedation (see section 4.4). Patients should be advised not to drive or operate \n\nmachinery until they have gained sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their \n\nabilities (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions are somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, pyrexia, fatigue, \n\nand vomiting. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent cause of discontinuations was transaminase elevation. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions reported with cannabidiol in placebo-controlled clinical studies are listed in the \n\ntable below by System Organ Class and frequency. \n\n \n\nThe frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \n\nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \n\nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions from clinical trials \n\nInfections and infestations Common Pneumoniaa, Bronchitis, Nasopharyngitis, \n\nUrinary tract infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common Decreased appetite \n\nCommon Increased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Irritability, Insomnia, Aggression, \n\nAbnormal behaviour, Agitation  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions from clinical trials \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Somnolencea \n\nCommon Lethargy, Drooling, Tremor \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea, Vomiting  \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common AST increased, ALT increased, GGT \n\nincreased, Liver function test abnormal \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common Rash \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nVery common Pyrexia, Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Common Weight decreased \na Grouped Terms: Pneumonia: Pneumonia, Pneumonia RSV, Pneumonia mycoplasmal, Pneumonia \n\nadenoviral, Pneumonia viral, Aspiration pneumonia; Somnolence: Somnolence, Sedation. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHepatocellular injury \n\nCannabidiol causes dose-related elevations of ALT and AST (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn controlled studies for LGS and DS, the incidence of ALT elevations above 3 times the ULN was \n\n13% in cannabidiol-treated patients compared with 1% in patients on placebo. Less than 1% of \n\ncannabidiol-treated patients had ALT or AST levels greater than 20 times the ULN. There were cases \n\nof transaminase elevations associated with hospitalisation in patients taking cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nRisk Factors for Hepatocellular injury \n\nConcomitant Valproate and Clobazam, Dose of cannabidiol and Baseline Transaminase Elevations \n\n \n\nConcomitant Valproate and Clobazam \n\nIn cannabidiol-treated patients, the incidence of ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN was \n\n23% in patients taking both concomitant valproate and clobazam, 17% in patients taking concomitant \n\nvalproate (without clobazam), 3% in patients taking concomitant clobazam (without valproate), and \n\n2% in patients taking neither drug.  \n\n \n\nDose \n\nALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN were reported in 16% of patients taking cannabidiol \n\n20 mg/kg/day compared with 3% in patients taking cannabidiol 10 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nBaseline transaminase elevations \n\nIn controlled trials (see section 5.1) in patients taking cannabidiol 20 mg/kg/day, the frequency of \n\ntreatment-emergent ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN was 31% (84% of these were on \n\nvalproate) when ALT was above the ULN at baseline, compared to 12% (89% of these were on \n\nvalproate) when ALT was within the normal range at baseline. Five percent (5%) of patients (all on \n\nvalproate) taking cannabidiol 10 mg/kg/day experienced ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN \n\nwhen ALT was above the ULN at baseline, compared with 3% of patients (all on valproate) in whom \n\nALT was within the normal range at baseline. \n\n \n\nSomnolence and sedation \n\nSomnolence and sedation events have been observed in controlled trials with cannabidiol in LGS and \n\nDS. The frequency in patients receiving 10 mg/kg/day cannabidiol and taking clobazam was 36%. The \n\nfrequency in patients receiving 20 mg/kg/day cannabidiol and taking clobazam was 41%. \n\n \n\nDecreased weight \n\nCannabidiol can cause weight loss. In LGS and DS patients, the decrease in weight appeared to be \n\ndose-related, with 19% of patients on cannabidiol 20 mg/kg/day experiencing a decrease in weight \n\n≥ 5%, compared to 8% in patients on cannabidiol 10 mg/kg/day. In some cases, the decreased weight \n\nwas reported as an adverse event (see the table above). Decreased appetite and weight loss may result \n\n\n\n10 \n\nin slightly reduced height gain. Continuous weight loss/absence of weight gain should be periodically \n\nchecked to evaluate if cannabidiol treatment should be continued. \n\n \n\nHaematologic abnormalities \n\nCannabidiol can cause decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit. In LGS and DS patients, the mean \n\ndecrease in haemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment was −0.37 g/dL in cannabidiol-treated \n\npatients. A corresponding decrease in haematocrit was also observed, with a mean change of −1.4% in \n\ncannabidiol-treated patients. \n\n \n\nTwenty-seven percent (27%) of cannabidiol-treated patients developed a new laboratory-defined \n\nanaemia during the course of the study (defined as a normal haemoglobin concentration at baseline, \n\nwith a reported value less than the lower limit of normal at a subsequent time point). \n\n \n\nIncreases in creatinine \n\nCannabidiol can cause elevations in serum creatinine. The mechanism has not been determined. In \n\ncontrolled studies in healthy adults and in patients with LGS and DS, an increase in serum creatinine \n\nof approximately 10% was observed within 2 weeks of starting cannabidiol. The increase was \n\nreversible in healthy adults. Reversibility was not assessed in studies in LGS and DS. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system. \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nExperience with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose is limited. Mild to moderate \n\ndiarrhoea and somnolence have been reported in healthy adult subjects taking a single dose of \n\n6000 mg; this equates to a dose of over 85 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. These adverse reactions resolved \n\nupon study completion. \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose the patient should be observed and appropriate symptomatic treatment given, \n\nincluding monitoring of vital signs. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics; ATC code: N03AX24 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThe precise mechanisms by which cannabidiol exerts its anticonvulsant effects in humans are \n\nunknown. Cannabidiol does not exert its anticonvulsant effect through interaction with cannabinoid \n\nreceptors. Cannabidiol reduces neuronal hyper-excitability through modulation of intracellular calcium \n\nvia G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV-1) \n\nchannels, as well as modulation of adenosine-mediated signalling through inhibition of adenosine \n\ncellular uptake via the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT-1). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn patients, there is a potential additive anticonvulsant effect from the bi-directional pharmacokinetic \n\ninteraction between cannabidiol and clobazam, which leads to increases in circulating levels of their \n\nrespective active metabolites, 7-OH-CBD (approximately 1.5-fold) and N-CLB (approximately 3-fold) \n\n(see sections 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nAdjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) \n\nThe efficacy of cannabidiol for the adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut \n\nsyndrome (LGS) was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group \n\nstudies (GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4). Each study consisted of a 4-week baseline period, a 2-week \n\ntitration period and a 12-week maintenance period. Mean age of the study population was 15 years and \n\n94% were taking 2 or more concomitant AEDs (cAEDs) during the trial. The most commonly used \n\ncAEDs (> 25% of patients) in both trials were valproate, clobazam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and \n\nrufinamide. Approximately 50% of the patients were taking concomitant clobazam. Of the patients \n\nthat were not taking clobazam, the majority had previously taken and subsequently discontinued \n\nclobazam treatment. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in drop seizures per 28 days over the \n\ntreatment period for the cannabidiol group compared to placebo. Drop seizures were defined as atonic, \n\ntonic, or tonic-clonic seizures that led or could have led to a fall or injury. Key secondary endpoints \n\nwere the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in drop seizure frequency, the percentage \n\nchange from baseline in total seizure frequency, and Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change \n\nat the last visit.  \n\n \n\nSubgroup analyses were conducted on multiple factors, including cAEDs. Results of the subgroup \n\nanalysis of patients treated with clobazam compared to patients treated without clobazam, indicated \n\nthat there is residual statistical uncertainty regarding the treatment effect of cannabidiol in patients not \n\ntaking clobazam. In this population, efficacy has not been established. \n\n \n\nTable 3 summarises the primary endpoint of percent reduction from baseline in drop seizures, and the \n\nkey secondary measure of proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in drop seizure \n\nfrequency, as well as results of the subgroup analysis for these outcome measures in patients treated \n\nwith concomitant clobazam. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 3: Primary and ≥ 50% responder key secondary outcome measures and subgroup analysis \n\nin LGS studies \n\n  Overall N \n\nSubgroup  \n\nWith  \n\nClobazam \n\nN \n\nDROP SEIZURES PER 28 DAYS \n\nPercentage Reduction from Baselinea \n\nGWPCARE3 Placebo 17.2% 76 22.7% 37 \n\n 10 mg/kg/day 37.2% 73 45.6% 37 \n\n 20 mg/kg/day 41.9% 76 64.3% 36 \n\nGWPCARE4 Placebo 21.8% 85 30.7% 42 \n\n 20 mg/kg/day 43.9% 86 62.4% 42 \n\nDifference or Percent Reduction Compared with Placebo (95% CI), p-valueb \n\nGWPCARE3 10 mg/kg/day 19.2  29.6%  \n\n  (7.7, 31.2)  (2.4%, 49.2%)  \n\n  p=0.0016  p=0.0355c  \n\n 20 mg/kg/day 21.6  53.8%  \n\n  (6.7, 34.8)  (35.7%, 66.8%)  \n\n  p=0.0047  p<0.0001c  \n\nGWPCARE4 20 mg/kg/day 17.2  45.7%  \n\n  (4.1, 30.3)  (27.0%, 59.6%)  \n\n  p=0.0135  p<0.0001c  \n\n≥ 50% REDUCTION IN DROP SEIZURES (RESPONDER ANALYSIS) \n\nPercentage of ≥ 50% Responders, p-valued \n\nGWPCARE3 Placebo 14.5% 76 21.6% 37 \n\n 10 mg/kg/day 35.6% 73 40.5% 37 \n\n  p=0.0030  p=0.0584c  \n\n 20 mg/kg/day 39.5% 76 55.6% 36 \n\n  p=0.0006  p=0.0021c  \n\nGWPCARE4 Placebo 23.5% 85 28.6% 42 \n\n 20 mg/kg/day 44.2% 86 54.8% 42 \n\n  p=0.0043  p=0.0140c  \n\nCI=95% confidence interval. \na Data for the overall population are presented as median percent reduction from baseline.

In individual patients titration up to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day \n\nmay be considered, based on the benefit-risk (see Section 4.2). \n\n \n\nOpen-label data \n\n \n\nAcross both randomised LGS studies, 99.5% of patients who completed the studies were enrolled into \n\nthe long-term open-label extension study (GWPCARE5). In the subgroup of LGS patients treated with \n\nconcomitant clobazam for 37 to 48 weeks (N=161), the median percentage reduction from baseline in \n\ndrop seizure frequency was 71% during Week 1-12, which was maintained through to Week 37-48, \n\nwith a median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency of 63%. \n\n \n\nAcross both randomised DS studies, 97.7% of patients who completed the studies were enrolled into \n\nGWPCARE5. In the subgroup of DS patients treated with concomitant clobazam for 37 to 48 weeks \n\n(N=54), the median percentage reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency was 60% \n\nduring Week 1-12, which was maintained through to Week 37-48, with a median percentage reduction \n\nfrom baseline in convulsive seizure frequency of 45%. \n\n \n\nAbuse \n\n \n\nIn a human abuse potential study, acute administration of cannabidiol to non-dependent adult \n\nrecreational drug users at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses produced small responses on positive \n\nsubjective measures such as Drug Liking and Take Drug Again. Compared to dronabinol (synthetic \n\nTHC) and alprazolam, cannabidiol has low abuse potential. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ncannabidiol in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of seizures associated with \n\nDS and LGS. (See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nCannabidiol appears rapidly in plasma with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 2.5–5 hours \n\nat steady state. \n\n \n\nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 2-4 days of twice daily dosing based on \n\npre-dose (Ctrough) concentrations. The rapid achievement of steady state is related to the multiphasic \n\nelimination profile of the drug in which the terminal elimination represents only a small fraction of the \n\ndrug’s clearance. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nCo-administration of cannabidiol with a high-fat/high calorie meal increased the rate and extent of \n\nabsorption (5-fold increase in Cmax and 4-fold increase in AUC) and reduced the total variability of \n\nexposure compared with the fasted state in healthy volunteers. To minimise the variability in the \n\nbioavailability of cannabidiol in the individual patient, administration of cannabidiol should be \n\nstandardised in relation to food intake including a ketogenic diet (high-fat meal). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro, > 94% of cannabidiol and its phase I metabolites were bound to plasma proteins, with \n\npreferential binding to human serum albumin. \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution was high in healthy volunteers at 20,963 L to 42,849 L and \n\ngreater than total body water, suggesting a wide distribution of cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\n \n\nThe half-life of cannabidiol in plasma was 56–61 hours after twice daily dosing for 7 days in healthy \n\nvolunteers. \n\n \n\nMetabolism \n\nCannabidiol is extensively metabolised by the liver via CYP450 enzymes and the UGT enzymes. The \n\nmajor CYP450 isoforms responsible for the phase I metabolism of cannabidiol are CYP2C19 and \n\nCYP3A4. The UGT isoforms responsible for the phase II conjugation of cannabidiol are UGT1A7, \n\nUGT1A9 and UGT2B7. \n\nStudies in healthy subjects showed there were no major differences in the plasma exposure to \n\ncannabidiol in CYP2C19 intermediate and ultra-rapid metabolisers when compared to extensive \n\nmetabolisers. \n\nThe phase I metabolites identified in standard in vitro assays were 7-COOH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and \n\n6-OH-CBD (a minor circulating metabolite). \n\nAfter multiple dosing with cannabidiol, the 7-OH-CBD metabolite (active in a preclinical model of \n\nseizure) circulates in human plasma at lower concentrations than the parent drug cannabidiol (~ 40% \n\nof CBD exposure) based on AUC. \n\n \n\nExcretion \n\nThe plasma clearance of cannabidiol following a single 1500 mg dose of cannabidiol is about \n\n1,111 L/h. Cannabidiol is predominantly cleared by metabolism in the liver and gut and excreted in \n\nfaeces, with renal clearance of parent drug being a minor pathway. \n\nCannabidiol does not interact with the major renal and hepatic transporters in a way that is likely to \n\nresult in relevant drug-drug interactions. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nThe Cmax and AUC of cannabidiol are close to dose-proportional over the therapeutic dose range. After \n\nsingle dosing, exposure over the range 750-6000 mg increases in a less than dose-proportional manner, \n\nindicating that absorption of cannabidiol may be saturable.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\n \n\nEffect of age, weight, sex, race \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that there were no clinically relevant effects of \n\nage, body weight, sex, or race on exposure to cannabidiol. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nPharmacokinetics of cannabidiol have not been studied in patients > 55 years of age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nPharmacokinetics of cannabidiol has not been studied in paediatric patients < 2 years of age. \n\n\n\n17 \n\nA small number of patients < 2 years with treatment-resistant epilepsy have been exposed to \n\ncannabidiol in an expanded access programme. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo effects on the Cmax or AUC of cannabidiol were observed following administration of a single dose \n\nof cannabidiol 200 mg in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment when compared to \n\npatients with normal renal function. Patients with end-stage renal disease were not studied.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo effects on cannabidiol or metabolite exposures were observed following administration of a single \n\ndose of cannabidiol 200 mg in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nSubjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment showed higher plasma concentrations of \n\ncannabidiol (approximately 2.5-5.2-fold higher AUC compared to healthy subjects with normal \n\nhepatic function). Cannabidiol should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment. The dose titration should be performed as detailed in section 4.2. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n\n \n\nIn patients with LGS, population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling indicated the \n\npresence of an exposure efficacy relationship for the likelihood of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in drop \n\nseizure frequency across the cannabidiol dose range tested (0 [placebo], 10 and 20 mg/kg/day). There \n\nwas a significant positive correlation between the derived AUC of cannabidiol and the probability of a \n\n≥ 50% response. The responder rate analysis also showed a correlation in the exposure–response \n\nrelationship for the active metabolite of cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD). PK/PD analysis also demonstrated \n\nthat systemic exposures to cannabidiol were correlated with some adverse events namely elevated \n\nALT, AST, diarrhoea, fatigue, GGT, loss of appetite, rash, and somnolence (see section 4.8). \n\nClobazam (separate analysis) was a significant covariate which caused the probability of GGT to \n\nincrease, loss of appetite to decrease, and somnolence to increase. \n\n \n\nDrug interaction studies \n\n \n\nIn vitro assessment of drug interactions \n\nCannabidiol is a substrate for CYP3A4, CYP2C19, UGT1A7, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. \n\nIn vitro data suggest that cannabidiol is an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated activity at clinically relevant concentrations. The \n\nmetabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD) is an inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A4 and \n\nUGT1A6-mediated activity, in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (see also section 4.5). \n\n \n\nInhibition of P-gp mediated efflux by cannabidiol in the intestine cannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\nCannabidiol induces CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 mRNA expression at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n\n \n\nCannabidiol and the metabolite 7-OH-CBD do not interact with the major renal or hepatic uptake \n\ntransporters and therefore are unlikely to result in relevant drug-drug interactions: OAT1, OAT3, \n\nOCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1and OATP1B3. Cannabidiol is not a substrate for or an \n\ninhibitor of the brain uptake transporters OATP1A2 and OATP2B1. Cannabidiol and 7-OH-CBD are \n\nnot substrates for or inhibitors of efflux transports P-gp/MDR1, BCRP or BSEP at clinically relevant \n\nplasma concentrations. The metabolite 7-COOH-CBD is a P-gp/MDR1 substrate and has the potential \n\nto inhibit BCRP, OATP1B3, and OAT3.  \n\n \n\nIn vivo assessment of drug interactions \n\nDrug interaction studies with AEDs \n\nPotential interactions between cannabidiol (750 mg twice daily in healthy volunteers and \n\n20 mg/kg/day in patients) and other AEDs were investigated in drug-drug interaction studies in \n\n\n\n18 \n\nhealthy volunteers and in patients and in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma drug \n\nconcentrations from placebo-controlled studies in the treatment of patients with LGS. \n\n \n\nThe combination of cannabidiol with clobazam caused an elevation in exposure to the active \n\nmetabolite N-desmethylclobazam. Although exposure to cannabidiol was not notably affected by \n\nclobazam use, the levels of an active metabolite, 7-OH-CBD, were elevated by this combination. \n\nTherefore, dose adjustments of cannabidiol or clobazam may be required. The interactions are \n\nsummarised in the table below. \n\n \n\nTable 5: Drug interactions between cannabidiol and concomitant antiepileptic drugs \n\nConcomitant AED Influence of AED on cannabidiol Influence of cannabidiol on AED \n\nClobazam No effect on cannabidiol levels. \n\nInteraction resulting in an increase \n\nin exposure of the active metabolite \n\n7-OH-CBD in HV* studies. a \n\nNo effect on clobazam levels. \n\nInteraction resulting in approximately \n\n3-fold increase in N-desmethylclobazam \n\nmetabolite exposure. b  \n\nValproate No effect No effect \n\nStiripentol  No effect on cannabidiol levels.  \n\nInteraction resulting in a decrease \n\n(approximately 30%) in Cmax and \n\nAUC of the active metabolite \n\n7-OH-CBD in HV* trials. \n\nInteraction resulting in an approximate \n\n28% increase in Cmax and 55% increase \n\nin AUC. \n\na average increases of 47% in AUC and 73% in Cmax b based on Cmax and AUC \n\n* HV=Healthy Volunteer \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nMutagenicity \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nNo adverse reactions were observed on male or female fertility or reproduction performance in rats at \n\ndoses up to 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 60-fold greater than the maximum recommended human \n\ndose (MRHD) at 20 mg/kg/day). \n\n \n\nThe embryo-foetal development (EFD) study performed in rabbits evaluated doses of 50, 80, or \n\n125 mg/kg/day. The dose level of 125 mg/kg/day induced decreased foetal body weights and increased \n\nfoetal structural variations associated with maternal toxicity. Maternal plasma cannabidiol exposures \n\nat the no observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for embryofoetal developmental toxicity in rabbits \n\nwere less than that in humans at 20 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nIn rats, the EFD study evaluated doses of 75, 150, or 250 mg/kg/day. Embryofoetal mortality was \n\nobserved at the high dose, with no treatment-related effects on implantation loss at the low or mid \n\ndoses. The NOAEL was associated with maternal plasma exposures (AUC) approximately 50 times \n\ngreater than the anticipated exposure in humans at 20 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nA pre- and post-natal development study was performed in rats at doses of 75, 150, or 250 mg/kg/day. \n\nDecreased growth, delayed sexual maturation, behavioural changes (decreased activity), and adverse \n\neffects on male reproductive organ development (small testes in adult offspring) and fertility were \n\nobserved in the offspring at doses ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was associated with maternal \n\nplasma cannabidiol exposures approximately 9 times that in humans at 20 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nJuvenile toxicity \n\n \n\nIn juvenile rats, administration of cannabidiol for 10 weeks (subcutaneous doses of 0 or 15 mg/kg on \n\npostnatal days [PNDs] 4-6 followed by oral administration of 0, 100, 150, or 250 mg/kg on PNDs 7-77 \n\n\n\n19 \n\nresulted in increased body weight, delayed male sexual maturation, neurobehavioural effects, \n\nincreased bone mineral density, and liver hepatocyte vacuolation. A no-effect dose was not \n\nestablished. The lowest dose causing developmental toxicity in juvenile rats (15 mg/kg \n\nsubcutaneous/100 mg/kg oral) was associated with Cmax cannabidiol exposures approximately 20 times \n\nthat in paediatric subjects at 20 mg/kg/day. In another study, cannabidiol was dosed to juvenile rats \n\nfrom PND 4-21 (as a subcutaneous injection) and from PND 22-50 (as an intravenous injection). A \n\nNOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was established. \n\n \n\nAbuse \n\n \n\nAnimal abuse-related studies show that cannabidiol does not produce cannabinoid-like behavioural \n\nresponses, including generalisation to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a drug discrimination \n\nstudy. Cannabidiol also does not produce animal self-administration, suggesting it does not produce \n\nrewarding effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nEpidyolex 100 mg/ml oral solution \n\ncannabidiol \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or the patient start taking this medicine because it \n\ncontains important information for you or the patient \n\n \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Epidyolex is and what it is used for.  \n\n2. What you or the patient need to know before taking Epidyolex.  \n\n3. How to take Epidyolex.  \n\n4. Possible side effects.  \n\n5. How to store Epidyolex. \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information. \n\n \n\n1. What Epidyolex is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nEpidyolex contains cannabidiol, a medicine which can be used to treat epilepsy, a condition where \n\nsomeone has seizures or fits. \n\n \n\nEpidyolex is used in combination with clobazam or with clobazam and other antiepileptic medicines to \n\ntreat seizures that occur with two rare conditions, called Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut \n\nsyndrome. It can be used in adults, adolescents and children of at least 2 years of age.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you or the patient need to know before taking Epidyolex \n\n \n\nDo not take Epidyolex \n\n- if you are allergic to cannabidiol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if your doctor determines that you have certain abnormal liver blood tests. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epidyolex or during treatment if: \n\n- you have or have had liver problems, as your doctor may need to change the dose of Epidyolex \nor may decide that Epidyolex is not appropriate for you. \n\nYour doctor may do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking this medicine and \n\nduring treatment, as Epidyolex can cause liver problems. If your liver is not working properly, \n\nyour treatment may need to be stopped. \n\n- you notice unusual changes in your mood or behaviour or have thoughts of harming or killing \nyourself. Contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (See section 4). \n\n- Epidyolex makes you feel sleepy. Do not drive, operate machinery, or take part in activities that \nrequire you to be alert and have fine control, such as cycling, until you know how Epidyolex \n\naffects you. \n\n- you stop taking Epidyolex suddenly. \n- your seizures happen more often, or if you experience a severe seizure while taking Epidyolex. \n\nContact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nEpidyolex must not be given to children under the age of 2 years, since there is no information on use \n\nin children below this age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Epidyolex \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Taking Epidyolex with certain other medicines may cause side effects, affect how the other \n\nmedicines work, or affect how Epidyolex works. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking \n\nto your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as your dose may need to be \n\nadjusted: \n\n- other epilepsy medicines, such as carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, lorazepam, \nmidazolam, phenytoin, stiripentol and valproate that are used to treat seizures  \n\n- medicines used to treat acid reflux (heartburn or acid regurgitation) such as omeprazole \n- mitotane (a medicine used to treat tumours in the adrenal gland) \n- morphine or diflunisal (medicines used to treat pain) \n- efavirenz (a medicine used to treat HIV/AIDS) \n- theophylline (a medicine used to treat asthma) \n- caffeine (a medicine for babies who need help breathing) \n- propofol (an anaesthetic used for people undergoing surgery) \n- simvastatin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, (medicines used to reduce cholesterol/lipids) \n- enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer) \n- bupropion (a medicine to help stop smoking or for treating obesity) \n- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety) \n- medicines to treat bacterial infections, such as rifampin, clarithromycin and erythromycin \n \n\nEpidyolex with food \n\nAlways take Epidyolex according to your doctor’s instructions and consistently either with or without \n\nfood including high-fat meals (such as ketogenic diet). (See also section 3, How to take Epidyolex). \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \n\npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not take Epidyolex while you are \n\npregnant unless the doctor decides the benefits outweigh the potential risks. \n\nYou should not breast-feed whilst taking Epidyolex, as Epidyolex is likely to be present in breast milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nTalk to your doctor about driving, using machines or when children undertake activities such as \n\ncycling or other sports, because you may feel sleepy after taking this medicine. \n\nYou should not drive, use machines or take part in activities that require you to be alert and have fine \n\ncontrol, until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not affected.  \n\n \n\nEpidyolex contains sesame oil, alcohol (ethanol), strawberry flavour components (including \n\nbenzyl alcohol). \n\nEpidyolex contains refined sesame oil which may rarely cause severe allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 10% by volume ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to 700 mg per dose (for an \n\nadult weighing 70 kg), equivalent to 14 millilitres (ml) of beer, or 6 ml of wine per dose. \n\nThe medicine may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. The alcohol content should be \n\ntaken into account in pregnant women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\nEffects of alcohol in children under the age of 6 years old may include sleepiness, behavioural \n\nchanges, and problems with concentration and taking part in school activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Epidyolex \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nEpidyolex is an oral solution (a liquid to be swallowed). Your doctor and pharmacist will tell you how \n\nmuch (number of ml) Epidyolex to take each day, how many times a day you should take it and which \n\nsyringe you should use for your dose (1 ml or 5 ml). \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate the dose according to your body weight. You may start on a low dose that \n\nyour doctor gradually increases over time. Contact your doctor if you are unsure of your dose or if you \n\nthink your dose may need to be changed. \n\n \n\nTaking Epidyolex with food can increase the amount of medicine your body takes in. You should try, \n\nas far as possible, to take Epidyolex consistently either with or without food, and according to your \n\ndaily routine, so you get the same effect each time.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have liver problems because the doctor may need to adjust the dose. \n\n \n\nDo not reduce the dose or stop this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nInstructions for the oral use of Epidyolex \n\n \n\nThe pack contains the following items \n\n Epidyolex oral solution bottle \n\n A plastic bag containing two 1 ml oral syringes and a bottle adaptor \n\n A plastic bag containing two 5 ml oral syringes and a bottle adaptor \n \n\nA spare syringe of each size is provided in the pack in case the first one is damaged or lost. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n1. Open the bag containing the correct oral syringe to measure your dose. \n \n\n If your dose is 1 ml (100 mg) or less, you should use the smaller 1 ml syringe. \n\n If your dose is more than 1 ml (100 mg), you should use the larger 5 ml syringe. \n \n\n If your dose is more than 5 ml (500 mg), you will need to use the larger 5 ml syringe more \nthan once. In this case, keep careful track of how many times you have filled the syringe (e.g., \n\nby marking off each 5 ml dose, respectively) so that you take the right dose. \n\n \n\nIt is important that you use the correct oral syringe to measure your dose. Your doctor or pharmacist \n\nwill let you know which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. \n\nFollowing the directions from the doctor or pharmacist, the bag containing the other syringes and \n\nadapter should be discarded from the pack unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to keep both \n\nsyringes until your final dose has been reached. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2. Remove the child-resistant cap on the \nbottle by pushing the cap down whilst \n\nturning the cap anti-clockwise. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3. Push the bottle adaptor firmly into the \nneck of the bottle, and make sure it is \n\nfully inserted. The adaptor could come \n\noff and cause choking if it is not fully \n\ninserted. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n4. Insert the tip of the correct oral syringe \nfully into the bottle adaptor, and with the \n\noral syringe in place, turn the bottle \n\nupside down.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n5. Slowly pull back the plunger of the \nsyringe, so the volume (number of ml) of \n\nsolution needed is drawn into the syringe. \n\nLine up the end of the plunger with the \n\nvolume marking required, as shown \n\nopposite. \n\n \n\nIf there is an air bubble in the syringe, \n\npush the liquid back into the bottle whilst \n\nkeeping the bottle upside down, and \n\nrepeat Step 5 until the bubble has gone. \n\n  \n \n\n6. Turn the bottle the right side up, and \ncarefully remove the oral syringe from \n\nthe adaptor. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n7. Place the tip of the oral syringe inside the \ncheek, and gently push the plunger to \n\nrelease the medicine. Do not push the \n\nplunger forcefully or direct the medicine \n\nto the back of the mouth or throat. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf the dose is more than 5 ml, repeat \n\nSteps 4 to 7 to give the remaining dose \n\nusing the 5 ml oral syringe. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n8. Screw the child resistant cap back on the \nbottle tightly, by turning the cap \n\nclockwise – you do not need to remove \n\nthe bottle adaptor, as the cap will fit over \n\nit. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n9. Fill a cup with warm soapy water and \nclean the oral syringe by drawing water \n\nin and out using the plunger.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n10. Remove the plunger from the barrel of \nthe syringe, and rinse both parts under \n\ntap water. Do not place the oral syringe \n\nin a dishwasher. \n\n \n\nShake off any water from both parts and \n\nallow them to dry in the air until the next \n\nuse. Make sure the oral syringe is \n\ncompletely dry before the next use, or it \n\ncould make the solution appear cloudy if \n\nwater gets in the bottle. \n\n \n\nIf the solution in the bottle has turned \n\ncloudy, this doesn’t change how well it \n\nworks. Continue to use the medicine as \n\nnormal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you or your patient take more Epidyolex than you should \n\nIf you may have taken more Epidyolex than you should, tell a doctor or pharmacist immediately, or \n\ncontact your nearest hospital casualty department, and take the medicine with you. \n\nSigns of taking more Epidyolex than you should include diarrhoea and sleepiness.  \n\nIf you or your patient forget to take Epidyolex \n\nIf you forget to take a dose, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next \n\ndose at your regular time. If you miss many doses, please talk to your doctor about the correct dose to \n\ntake. \n\nIf you or your patient stop taking Epidyolex \n\nDo not reduce the dose or stop taking Epidyolex without first talking to your doctor. The doctor will \n\nexplain how to gradually stop taking Epidyolex. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
