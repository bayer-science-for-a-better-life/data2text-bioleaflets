PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \n\nClear and colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSupemtek is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in adults.  \n \nSupemtek should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology: \n\nOne dose of 0.5 mL. \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy of Supemtek have not yet been established in individuals below 18 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration: \n\nFor intramuscular injection only. The preferred site is in the deltoid muscle. \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravascularly and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the \nsame syringe. \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any trace \nresiduals such as octylphenol ethoxylate. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\nHypersensitivity \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n\nIntercurrent illness \nVaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved. \n\nImmunodeficiency \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be \ninsufficient to prevent influenza. \n\nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \nAs with all injectable vaccines, Supemtek must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopaenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration to these subjects. \n \nSyncope \nSyncope can occur following or even before any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the \nneedle injection.This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Procedures should be \nin place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope. \n\nProtection \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Supemtek may not protect all vaccinees. \n\nSodium content \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say is \nessentially \u201csodium free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed, nor data to assess the concomitant administration of \nSupemtek with other vaccines. \nIf Supemtek is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should \nalways be administered at different injection sites. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of Supemtek in pregnant women. \nOne animal study performed with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal development or early post-natal \ndevelopment. \nAn assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before \nadministering Supemtek to a pregnant woman. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Supemtek vaccine is excreted in human milk. \nAn assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before \nadministering Supemtek to a breast-feeding woman. \n \nFertility \nNo human fertility data are available. \nThe animal study with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate harmful effects on \nfemale fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSupemtek has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nSupemtek has been administered to and safety data collected from 998 adults 18-49 years of age \n(Study 1) and 4328 adults 50 years of age and older (Study 2).  \nThe most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were injection-site reactions \n(tenderness and pain) reported overall by 48% and 37% of study participants 18-49 years of age \nreceiving Supemtek respectively. In study participants 50 years of age and older, injection site \ntenderness was reported by 34% and injection site pain reported by 19%. \nThe severity of the reactions was mild to moderate. Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days \nafter vaccination. All resolved without sequelae. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class under headings of frequency using \nthe following convention:  \nVery common (\u22651/10);  \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10);  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100);  \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000);  \nVery rare (<1/10,000);  \nFrequency not known (adverse reactions from post-marketing experience; cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported following vaccination in adults 18 years and older during \nclinical trials and post-marketing surveillance \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nclass \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000, \n<1/1,000) \n\nFrequency not \nknown \n\nImmune system \ndisorders   \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nincluding \nanaphylactic \nreaction \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache, \nFatigue    \n\n Dizziness(4,6) Guillain-Barr\u00e9 \nsyndrome7 \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  \n\nCough,  \nOropharyngeal \npain \n \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  Nausea \n\nDiarrhoea(4)   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  \nPruritus(2,4) , \nDermatitis(4,5), \nRash(4,5) \n\nUrticaria(4,6)  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia(1), \nArthralgia(1)  \n\n   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nLocal \ntenderness,  \nLocal pain \n\nFirmness / \nSwelling, \nRedness, Fever \n(2,3), Shivering \n/ Chills,  \n\nFlu-like \nsymptoms(4,6), \nInjection site \npruritus(4) \n\n  \n\n(1) Common in adults 50 years of age and older. \n(2) Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) in adults 50 years of age and older. \n(3) \u226538.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). \n(4) Reported as unsolicited adverse reaction. \n(5) Not reported in adults 50 years of age and older. \n(6) Not reported in adults 18-49 years of age. \n(7) Reported from post-marketing surveillance, no causal relationship established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nImmunogenicity \n\nSupemtek was evaluated in healthy adults of 18-49 years of age in a randomized, observer-blind, \nactive controlled, non-inferiority immunogenicity, multi-center trial conducted during the 2014-\n2015 influenza season in the United States (study 1).  \nIn the study 1, subjects received Supemtek (N=998) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine (IIV4) (N=332). Immunogenicity was assessed before and 28 days after \nadministration of a single dose of study vaccine. \n\nHaemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined for the two \nvaccine groups for each vaccine antigen. Immunogenicity was compared by calculating the \ndifference in seroconversion rates (SCR) and the ratios of GMTs of Comparator to Supemtek.  \n\nStudy 1 had two co-primary endpoints: GMTs and Day 28 HAI seroconversion rates for each of the \nfour antigens contained in the study vaccines.  \n\nSupemtek met the success criterion for GMTs for three of the four antigens but did not meet the \nsuccess criteria for the B/Victoria lineage antigen (Table 2). Antibody titres against the B/Victoria \nwere low in both vaccine groups. \n \nTable 2: Comparison of Day 28 Post-Vaccination Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) for \nSupemtek and Comparator in Adults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1 (Immunogenicity \nPopulation) 1,2,3  \n\nAntigen Post-vaccination GMT Supemtek N=969 \nPost-vaccination GMT \nComparator N=323 \n\nGMT Ratio \nComparator/ \nSupemtek (95% CI)\n\nA/H1N1 493 397 0.81 (0.71, 0.92)\nA/H3N2 748 377 0.50 (0.44, 0.57)\nB/Yamagata 156 134 0.86 ( 0.74, 0.99)\nB/Victoria 43 64 1.49 (1.29, 1.71)\n\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GMT, geometric mean titer.  \n1 HI titers were assayed using egg-derived antigens. \n2 Comparator: egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. \n3 Success in meeting the GMTs endpoint was pre-defined as an upper bound (UB) of the two-sided 95% CI of \nGMTComparator / GMT Supemtek \u2264 1.5. \n \nSupemtek met the success criterion for SCRs for three of the four antigens (Table 3), but not for the \nB/Victoria lineage. The HAI response to the B/Victoria lineage antigen was low in both vaccine \ngroups. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nTable 3: Comparison of Day 28 Seroconversion Rates for Supemtek and Comparator in \nAdults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1 (Immunogenicity Population) 1,2,3,4 \n\nAntigen SCR (%, 95% CI) Supemtek N=969 \nSCR (%, 95% CI) \nComparator N=323 \n\nSCR Difference (%) \nComparator - \nSupemtek [95% CI]\n\nA/H1N1 66.7 (63.6, 69.6) 63.5 (58.0, 68.7) -3.2 (-9.2, 2.8) \nA/H3N2 72.1 (69.2, 74.9) 57.0 (51.4, 62.4) -15.2 (-21.3, -9.1)\nB/Yamagata 59.6 (56.5, 62.8) 60.4 (54.8, 65.7) 0.7 (-5.4, 6.9) \nB/Victoria 40.6 (37.4, 43.7) 58.2 (52.6, 63.6) 17.6 (11.4, 23.9) \n\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; SCR, seroconversion rate  \n1 HI titers were assayed using egg-derived antigens.  \n2 Comparator was an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. \n3 Seroconversion was defined as either a pre-vaccination HAI titer of <1:10 and a post-vaccination HAI titer of \u22651:40, or a \npre-vaccination HAI titer of \u22651:10 and a minimum 4- fold rise in post vaccination HAI titer, at Day 28. \n4 Success in meeting the seroconversion rate (SCR) endpoint was pre-defined as an upper bound (UB) of the two-sided \n95% CI of SCR Comparator \u2013 SCR Supemtek \u226410%. \n \nThe study 1 in adults 18-49 years of age was conducted in parallel to the study 2 in adults of \n50 years of age and older. These adults 18-49 years of age were vaccinated during the same \ninfluenza season (2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season) and received the same \nSupemtek formulation (same vaccine strain composition) as adults of 50 years of age and older in \nthe study 2. The immune response induced by Supemtek was assessed by the same HAI assay and \nperformed by the same laboratory for both studies.  The immunogenicity results in adults 18-49 \nyears of age (study 1) and adults 50 years of age and older (study 2) are presented in table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of HAI Antibody Response to Supemtek for Each Strain in Adults 18-\n49 years (Study 1) and Adults\u226550 years (Study 2) - Immunogenicity Analysis Set \n\n Adults 18-49 years N=969 \nAdults \u226550 years \nN=314 \n\nGMT post-vaccination (95% CI)   \n\nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1) 493 (460; 527) 190 (164; 221)\nA/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) 748 (700; 800) 522(462; 589) \nB/Massachusetts/02/2012 (Yamagata \nlineage) 156 (145; 168) 55 (48; 64) \n\nB/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) 43 (40; 46) 29 (26; 33) \n\nSCR % (95% CI)   \n\nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1) 66.7 (63.6; 69.6) 44.9 (39.3; 50.6)\nA/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) 72.1 (69.2; 74.9) 54.5 (48.8; 60.1)\nB/Massachusetts/02/2012 (Yamagata \nlineage) 59.6 (56.5; 62.8) 38.9 (33.4; 44.5) \n\nB/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) 40.6 (37.4; 43.7) 21.0 (16.6; 25.9)\nGMTR % (95% CI)   \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1) 8.35 (7.59; 9.19) 4.31 (3.71; 5.02)\nA/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) 10.1 (9.12; 11.1) 6.01 (5.03; 7.18)\nB/Massachusetts/02/2012 (Yamagata \nlineage) 3.59 (3.35; 3.85) 2.16 (1.94; 2.40) \n\nB/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) 5.89 (5.43; 6.40) 3.18 (2.81; 3.59)\nN=number of subjects with available data for the considered endpoint  \nGMT: Geometric Mean Titer; CI: Confidence Interval; SCR: Seroconversion rate; GMTR: Geometric Mean Titer of \nindividuals ratios (post dose / pre dose) \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \nThese immunogenicity data provide supportive information for the 18-49 years of age group in \naddition to vaccine efficacy data available in adults \u2265 50 years of age (see Clinical Efficacy). \n \nClinical efficacy  \n\nSupemtek efficacy in terms of prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) \ncaused by any strain of influenza, was evaluated in adults \u2265 50 years of age and conducted during \nthe 2014-2015 influenza season in the United States (study 2). \n\nA total of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single \ndose of Supemtek (n=4474) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=4489). \nA total of 5412 (60.4%) subjects were 50-64 years of age, 2532 (28.2%) were 65-74 years of age \nand 1019 (11.4 %) were \u2265 75 years of age. \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of Study 2 was reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \n(rtPCR)-positive, protocol-defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. \n\nLaboratory-confirmed protocol defined ILI was defined as having at least one symptom in each of \ntwo categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms, which could include sore throat, cough, \nsputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing, or systemic symptoms such as fever > 99\u00b0F \n(>37\u00b0C) , chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia, laboratory-confirmed by rtPCR. \nUS epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) \nviruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while \nA/H1N1 and B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens. Supemtek met the pre-\nspecified success criterion for non-inferiority to the comparator pre-defined as a lower bound of the \ntwo sided 95% CI >-20%.  \n\nOf the 4474 participants exposed to Supemtek in a phase 3 active-controlled study (Study 2), a total \nof 1761 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed \nbetween older and younger participants, the number of patients aged 65 and over in this study was \nnot sufficient to determine statistically whether this age group will respond differently from younger \nindividuals. \n \nTable 5: Relative Vaccine Efficacy (rVE) of Supemtek versus Comparator against \nLaboratory-Confirmed Influenza, Regardless of Antigenic Similarity to Vaccine Antigens, \nAdults 50 Years of Age and Older, Study 2 (Efficacy Population)1,2 \n\n Supemtek \n(N=4303) \n\nComparator \n(N=4301) RR rVE % (95% CI) \n\nn Attack Rate % (n/N) n \nAttack Rate \n% (n/N) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza3 96 2.2 138 3.2 0.70 30 (10\n\n5, 47) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza A3 73 1.7 114 2.7 0.64 36 (14, 53) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza B3 23 0.5 24 0.6 0.96 4 (-72, 46) \n\nAll Culture-confirmed \nProtocol-defined ILI3,4 58 1.3 101 2.3 0.57 43 (21, 59) \n\nAbbreviations: rtPCR=reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; Comparator= an egg-based quadrivalent \ninactivated influenza vaccine; n=number of influenza cases; N=number of subjects in treatment group; RR=relative risk \n(Attack Rate Supemtek/Attack Rate IIV4); rVE = [(1-RR) x 100].  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n1 Excluded subjects with protocol deviations that could adversely affect efficacy. \n2 Primary Analysis. All cases of rtPCR-confirmed influenza are included. \n3 Post hoc analyses. All cases of influenza A were A/H3N2. Cases of influenza B were not distinguished by lineage.  \n4 Culture of rtPCR-positive samples was performed in MDCK cells. \n5 The lower bound (LB) of the 95% confidence interval met the pre-specified, exploratory criterion for superior relative \nvaccine efficacy, LB > 9%. \n \nEfficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3)  \n\nThe efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) is relevant to Supemtek because \nboth vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. \n\nThe efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine in protecting against influenza illness was \nevaluated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in the \nUnited States during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study 3). \n\nStudy 3 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single \ndose of RIV3 (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304).  \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of Study 3 was defined as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with a \npositive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenically resembling a strain represented in RIV3. \nILI is defined as fever of \u2265100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both, on the \nsame or consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the \ninfluenza rate for RIV3 relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (n=4648).  \nDue to very small number of cultured confirmed influenza cases with matched strains, an \nexploratory analysis of VE of RIV3 against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from \nany subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting ILI criteria was done, demonstrated an efficacy \nestimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 6 for VE by case definition. \n \nTable 6: Vaccine Efficacy Against Culture-Confirmed Influenza in Healthy Adults 18-\n49 Years of Age, Study 31,3 \n\nCase definition \nRIV3 (N=2344) Saline Placebo (N=2304) \n\nRIV3 \nVaccine \nEfficacy4 \n% \n\n95% \nConfidence \nInterval Cases, \n\nn \nRate, \n% \n\nCases, \nn \n\nRate, \n% \n\nPositive culture with a strain represented in the vaccine \nCDC-ILI2, all matched strains5 1 0.04 4 0.2 75.4 (-148.0, 99.5) \nAny ILI, all matched strains 2 0.1 6 0.3 67.2 (-83.2, 96.8) \nPositive culture with any strain, regardless of match to the vaccine \nCDC-ILI2, all strains 44 1.9 78 3.4 44.6 (18.8, 62.6) \nSub-Type A 26 1.1 56 2.4 54.4 (26.1, 72.5) \nType B 18 0.8 23 1.0 23.1 (-49.0, 60.9) \nAny ILI, all strains 64 2.7 114 4.9 44.8 (24.4, 60.0) \nSub-Type A 41 1.7 79 3.4 49.0 (24.7, 65.9) \nType B 23 1.0 36 1.6 37.2 (-8.9, 64.5) \n\n1 Vaccine efficacy (VE) = 1 minus the ratio of RIV3 /placebo infection rates (10). \n2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) defined as fever of \u2265100\u00baF \n(37.8\u00b0C) oral accompanied by cough and/or sore throat, on the same day or on consecutive days. \n3 The pre-defined success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lower bound of the 95% confidence \ninterval (CI) of VE should be at least 40%. \n4 Determined under the assumption of Poisson event rates, according to Breslow and Day, 1987. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n5 Primary endpoint of trial.  \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSupemtek in children from 6 months to 3 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection.  \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSupemtek in children from 3 years to 17 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety data on the trivalent formulation revealed no special hazard for humans based on \nconventional studies of repeat dose and local toxicity, reproductive and developmental (including \nteratogenicity) toxicity and safety pharmacology studies.The results of these studies with trivalent \nrecombinant influenza vaccine are relevant to Supemtek because both vaccines are manufactured \nusing the same process and have overlapping compositions. \n \n \n6.

What Supemtek is and what it is used for  \n\n \nSupemtek is a vaccine for adults who are 18 years of age and older. This vaccine helps to protect \nyou against flu (influenza). Supemtek is egg-free because of the technology used to produce it. \n \nHow Supemtek works \nWhen a person is given Supemtek, the body\u2019s natural defence (the immune system) produces \nprotection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \nAs with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \nWhen to have a flu vaccine \nFlu can spread very fast.  \n\u2022 It is caused by different types of flu virus that can change every year. This is why you might \n\nneed to be vaccinated every year.  \n\u2022 The greatest risk of catching flu is during the cold months between October and March.  \n\u2022 If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, it is still sensible to be vaccinated up until the spring \n\nsince you run the risk of catching flu until then.  \nYour doctor will be able to recommend the best time to be vaccinated. \n\n \n \n2.

Vaccination may need to be delayed until your \n\nfever has gone. \n\u2022 you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency or you are taking medicines that \n\naffect the immune system such as cancer medicine (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid \nmedicines). \n\n\u2022 you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n\u2022 you have fainted with an injection before. Fainting can happen after, or even before an \n\ninjection. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nreceiving Supemtek.  \n \nOther medicines and Supemtek \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other \nvaccine.  \nSupemtek may be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this vaccine.
