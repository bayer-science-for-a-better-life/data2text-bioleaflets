NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nPedea 5 mg/ml solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach ml of the solution contains 5 mg ibuprofen. \n\nEach ampoule of 2 ml contains 10 mg ibuprofen. \n\n \n\nExcipients: each ml contains 7.5 mg of sodium. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm newborn infants less \n\nthan 34 weeks of gestational age.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with Pedea should only be carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit under the \n\nsupervision of an experienced neonatologist. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nA course of therapy is defined as three intravenous injections of Pedea given at 24-hour intervals. The \n\nfirst injection should be given after the first 6 hours of life. \n\nThe ibuprofen dose is adjusted to the body weight as follows: \n\n-  1st injection: 10 mg/kg, \n\n-  2nd and 3rd injections: 5 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nIf anuria or manifest oliguria occurs after the first or second dose, the next dose should be withheld \n\nuntil urine output returns to normal levels. \n\nIf the ductus arteriosus does not close 48 hours after the last injection or if it re-opens, a second course \n\nof 3 doses, as above, may be given. \n\nIf the condition is unchanged after the second course of therapy, surgery of the patent ductus \n\narteriosus may then be necessary. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor intravenous use only. \n\nPedea should be administered as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. If necessary, \n\nthe injection volume may be adjusted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. Any unused portion of the solution should \n\nbe discarded. \n\nThe total volume of solution injected should take into account the total daily fluid volume \n\nadministered. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; \n- Life-threatening infection; \n- Active bleeding, especially intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage; \n- Thrombocytopenia or coagulation defects; \n- Significant impairment of renal function; \n- Congenital heart disease in which patency of the ductus arteriosus is necessary for satisfactory \n\npulmonary or systemic blood flow (e.g. pulmonary atresia, severe tetralogy of Fallot, severe \n\ncoarctation of the aorta); \n\n- Known or suspected necrotising enterocolitis; \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nBefore administration of Pedea an adequate echocardiographic examination should be performed in \n\norder to detect a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and to exclude pulmonary \n\nhypertension and ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. \n\n \n\nSince prophylactic use in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn \n\ninfants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased pulmonary and renal \n\nadverse events, Pedea should not be used prophylactically at any gestational age (see sections 4.8 and \n\n5.1). In particular, severe hypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension was reported in 3 infants within \n\none hour of the first infusion and was reversed within 30 min after start of inhaled nitric oxide therapy. \n\nIf hypoxaemia occurs during or following Pedea infusion, close attention should be paid to pulmonary \n\npressure. \n\n \n\nSince ibuprofen was shown in vitro to displace bilirubin from its binding site to albumin, the risk of \n\nbilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborn infants may be increased (see section 5.2). Therefore, \n\nibuprofen should not be used in infants with marked elevated bilirubin concentration. \n\n \n\nAs a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ibuprofen may mask the usual signs and \n\nsymptoms of infection. Pedea must therefore be used cautiously in the presence of an infection (see \n\nalso section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPedea should be administered carefully to avoid extravasation and potential resultant irritation to \n\ntissues. \n\n \n\nAs ibuprofen may inhibit platelet aggregation, premature neonates should be monitored for signs of \n\nbleeding. \n\n \n\nAs ibuprofen may decrease the clearance of aminoglycosides, strict surveillance of their serum levels \n\nis recommended during co-administration with ibuprofen. \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring of both renal and gastrointestinal function is recommended. \n\n \n\nIn preterm newborn infants less than 27 weeks of gestational age, the closure rate of the ductus \n\narteriosus (33 to 50%) was shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (15 mg) per 2 ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThe concomitant use of Pedea with the following medicinal products is not recommended: \n\n- diuretics: ibuprofen may reduce the effect of diuretics; diuretics can increase the risk of \nnephrotoxicity of NSAIDs in dehydrated patients. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n- anticoagulants: ibuprofen may increase the effect of anticoagulants and enhance the risk of \nbleeding. \n\n- corticosteroids: ibuprofen may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. \n- nitric oxide: since both medicinal products inhibit platelet function, their combination may in theory \n\nincrease the risk of bleeding. \n\n- other NSAIDs: the concomitant use of more than one NSAID should be avoided because of the \nincreased risk of adverse reactions. \n\n- aminoglycosides: since ibuprofen may decrease the clearance of aminoglycosides, their co-\nadministration may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nNot relevant \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNot relevant \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nData are currently available on approximately 1,000 preterm newborn from both the literature \n\nconcerning ibuprofen and clinical trials with Pedea. Causality of adverse events reported in the \n\npreterm newborn is difficult to assess since they may be related to the haemodynamic consequences of \n\nthe patent ductus arteriosus as well as to direct effects of ibuprofen. \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100, <1/10) and uncommon (≥1/1,000, <1/100). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Very common: Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Intraventricular haemorrhage, \n\nPeriventricular leukomalacia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia*  \n\nCommon: Pulmonary haemorrhage  \n\nUncommon: Hypoxemia*  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: Necrotizing enterocolitis, Intestinal \n\nperforation \n\nUncommon: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\nUnknown: Gastric perforation \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common: Oliguria, Fluid retention, Haematuria \n\nUncommon: Acute renal failure \n\nInvestigations Very Common: Blood creatinine increased, Blood \n\nsodium decreased \n\n* see below \n\n \n\nIn a clinical curative trial involving 175 preterm newborn infants less than 35 weeks of gestational \n\nage, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post-conceptional age was 13/81 (16%) \n\nfor indomethacin versus 23/94 (24%) for ibuprofen. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial where Pedea was administered prophylactically during the first 6 hours of life, severe \n\nhypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension was reported in 3 newborn infants less than 28 weeks of \n\ngestational age. This occurred within one hour of the first infusion and was reversed within 30 minutes \n\nafter the inhalation of nitric oxide. There have also been post-marketing reports of pulmonary \n\nhypertension where Pedea was administered to premature neonates in the therapeutic setting. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n5 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported with intravenous ibuprofen in preterm newborn infants. \n\n \n\nHowever, overdose has been described in infants and children administered oral ibuprofen: CNS \n\ndepression, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbances, bradycardia, hypotension, apnoea, abnormal renal \n\nfunction, haematuria have been observed. \n\nMassive overdose (up to more than 1000 mg/kg) has been reported to induce coma, metabolic \n\nacidosis, and transient renal failure. All patients recovered with conventional treatment. Only one \n\nrecorded death has been published: after an overdose of 469 mg/kg, a 16-month old child developed \n\nan apnoeic episode with seizures and a fatal aspiration pneumonia. \n\n \n\nThe management of ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01 EB16 \n\n \n\nIbuprofen is a NSAID that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Ibuprofen \n\nis a racemic mixture of S(+) and R(-) enantiomers. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the S(+) \n\nisomer is responsible for the clinical activity. Ibuprofen is a non selective inhibitor of cyclo-\n\noxygenase, leading to reduced synthesis of prostaglandins. \n\nSince prostaglandins are involved in the persistence of the ductus arteriosus after birth, this effect is \n\nbelieved to be the main mechanism of action of ibuprofen in this indication. \n\n \n\nIn a dose-response study of Pedea in 40 preterm newborn infants, the ductus arteriosus closure rate \n\nassociated to the 10-5-5 mg/kg dose regimen was 75% (6/8) in neonates of 27-29 weeks’ gestation and \n\n33% (2/6) in neonates of 24-26 weeks’ gestation. \n\n \n\nProphylactic use of Pedea in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm \n\nnewborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased incidence of renal \n\nfailure and pulmonary adverse events including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary \n\nhaemorrhage, as compared to curative use. Conversely, a lower incidence of neonatal grade III-IV \n\nintraventricular haemorrhage and of surgical ligation was associated with prophylactic use of Pedea. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nDistribution \n\nAlthough a great variability is observed in the premature population, peak plasma concentrations are \n\nmeasured around 35-40 mg/l after the initial loading dose of 10 mg/kg as well as after the last \n\nmaintenance dose, whatever gestational and postnatal age. Residual concentrations are around 10-\n\n15 mg/l 24 hours after the last dose of 5 mg/kg. \n\nPlasma concentrations of the S-enantiomer are much higher than those of the R-enantiomer, which \n\nreflects a rapid chiral inversion of the R- to the S-form in a proportion similar to adults (about 60%). \n\n \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is on average 200 ml/kg (62 to 350 according to various studies). \n\nThe central volume of distribution may depend on the status of the ductus and decrease as the ductus \n\ncloses. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn vitro studies suggest that, similarly to other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is highly bound to plasma albumin, \n\nalthough this seems to be significantly lower (95 %) compared with adult plasma (99 %). Ibuprofen \n\ncompetes with bilirubin for albumin binding in newborn infant serum and, as a consequence, the free \n\nfraction of bilirubin may be increased at high ibuprofen concentrations. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nElimination rate is markedly lower than in older children and adults, with an elimination half-life \n\nestimated at approximately 30 hours (16–43). The clearance of both enantiomers increases with \n\ngestational age, at least in the range of 24 to 28 weeks. \n\n \n\nPK-PD relationship \n\nIn preterm newborns ibuprofen significantly reduced plasma concentrations of prostaglandins and \n\ntheir metabolites, particularly PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF-1-alpha. Low levels were sustained up to \n\n72 hours in neonates who received 3 doses of ibuprofen, whereas subsequent re-increases were \n\nobserved at 72 hours after only 1 dose of ibuprofen. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThere are no preclinical data considered relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other \n\nsections of this Summary of Product Characteristics. With the exception of an acute toxicity study, no \n\nfurther studies have been carried out in juvenile animals with Pedea. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Therefore, for asepsis of the ampoule before use, ethanol 60% or isopropyl alcohol \n\n70% is recommended. \n\nWhen disinfecting the neck of the ampoule with an antiseptic, to avoid any interaction with the Pedea \n\nsolution, the ampoule must be completely dry before it is opened. \n\n \n\nThe required volume to be given to the infant should be determined according to body weight, and \n\nshould be injected intravenously as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. \n\n \n\nUse only sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution to \n\nadjust injection volume. \n\nThe total volume of solution injected to preterm infants should take into account the total daily fluid \n\nvolume administered. A maximal volume of 80 ml/kg/day on the first day of life should usually be \n\nrespected; this should be progressively increased in the following 1-2 weeks (about 20 ml/kg \n\nbirthweight/day) up to a maximal volume of 180 ml/kg birthweight/day. \n\n \n\nBefore and after administration of Pedea, to avoid contact with any acidic solution, rinse the infusion \n\nline over 15 minutes with 1.5 to 2 ml of either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml \n\n(5%), solution for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter first opening of an ampoule, any unused portions must be discarded. \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your baby. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their symptoms are the same as your baby’s. \n\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor or your pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIn this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Pedea is and what it is used for \n\n2. Before Pedea is administered to your baby \n\n3. How Pedea is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Pedea \n\n6. Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT PEDEA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \n\nWhile a baby is inside its mother’s womb it does not need to use its lungs. An unborn baby has a blood \n\nvessel called the ductus arteriosus near the heart which allows the baby’s blood to bypass the lungs and \n\ncirculate to the rest of the body. \n\nWhen the baby is born and starts using its lungs the ductus arteriosus normally closes. However, in \n\nsome cases this does not happen. The medical term for this condition is ‘patent ductus arteriosus’, i.e. \n\nan open ductus arteriosus. This can cause heart problems in your baby. This condition is much more \n\nfrequent in premature newborn than in full-term newborn infants. \n\nPedea, when given to your baby, can help to close the ductus arteriosus. \n\n \n\nThe active substance in Pedea is ibuprofen. Pedea closes the ductus arteriosus by inhibiting the \n\nproduction of prostaglandin, a naturally occurring chemical in the body which keeps the ductus \n\narteriosus open. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE PEDEA IS ADMINISTERED TO YOUR BABY \n \n\nPedea will only be given to your baby in a special neonatal intensive care unit by qualified health care \n\nprofessionals. \n\n \n\nDo not use Pedea \n- if your baby is allergic (hypersensitive) to ibuprofen or any of the other ingredients of Pedea; \n- if your baby has a life-threatening infection which has not been treated; \n- if your baby is bleeding, especially if the bleeding is inside the skull or in the intestines; \n- if your baby has a decrease of blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia) or other problems \n\nwith their blood clotting; \n\n- if your baby has kidney problems; \n- if your baby has other problems with their heart which require the ductus arteriosus to remain open \n\nso that adequate circulation of the blood is maintained; \n\n- if your baby has or is suspected to have certain problems with their intestines (a condition called \nnecrotising enterocolitis); \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTake special care with Pedea \n\n- Before treatment with Pedea, your baby’s heart will be examined to confirm that the ductus \narteriosus is open. \n\n- Pedea should not be given in the first 6 hours of life. \n- If your baby is suspected of having liver disease, signs and symptoms of which include yellowing \n\nof the skin and eyes. \n\n- If your baby is already suffering from an infection that is being treated, the doctor will treat your \nbaby with Pedea only after careful consideration of your baby’s condition. \n\n- Pedea should be carefully administered to your baby by the healthcare professional, to avoid \ndamage to the skin and surrounding tissues. \n\n- Ibuprofen may reduce the ability of your baby’s blood to clot. Your baby should therefore be \nwatched for signs of prolonged bleeding. \n\n- Your baby may develop some bleeding from the intestines and the kidneys. To detect this, your \nbaby’s stools and urine may be tested to determine if there is any blood present in them. \n\n- Pedea may reduce the amount of urine your baby passes. If this is significant, your baby’s \ntreatment may be stopped until the volume of urine returns to normal. \n\n- Pedea may be less effective in very premature babies less than 27 weeks of gestational age. \n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if your baby is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nCertain medicines, if given together with Pedea, may cause side effects. These are detailed below: \n\n \n\n-  your baby may have problems passing urine and may have been prescribed diuretics. Ibuprofen \n\nmay reduce the effect of these medicines. \n\n \n\n-  your baby may be given anticoagulants (medicine preventing blood clotting). Ibuprofen may \n\nincrease the anti-clotting effect of this product. \n\n \n\n-  your baby may be given nitric oxide to improve blood oxygenation. Ibuprofen may increase the \n\nrisk of bleeding. \n\n \n\n-  your baby may be given corticosteroids to prevent inflammation. Ibuprofen may increase the \n\nrisk of bleeding in the stomach and intestines. \n\n \n\n-  your baby may be given aminosides (one family of antibiotics) to treat infection. Ibuprofen may \n\nincrease blood concentrations and thus increase the risk of toxicity on kidney and ear \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Pedea \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (15 mg) per 2 ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW PEDEA IS USED \n \n\nPedea will only be given to your baby in a special neonatal intensive care unit by qualified healthcare \n\nprofessional. \n\n \n\nA course of therapy is defined as three intravenous injections of Pedea given at 24 hour intervals. The \n\ndose to be administered will be calculated from the weight of your baby. It is 10 mg/kg for the first \n\nadministration and 5 mg/kg for the second and the third administrations. \n\n \n\nThis calculated amount will be given by infusion in a vein over a period of 15 minutes. \n\nIf after this first course of treatment, the ductus arteriosus is not closed or re-opens, your baby’s doctor \n\nmay decide to give a second course of treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIf after the second course of treatment, the ductus arteriosus is still not closed, a surgery may then be \n\nproposed. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, Pedea can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. However, it is \n\ndifficult to distinguish them from frequent complications occurring in premature babies and \n\ncomplications due to the disease. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n\nvery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \n\ncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \n\nuncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \n\nvery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n\nnot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \n\nVery common:  \n\n- Decrease in the number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia), \n- Decrease in white blood cells called neutrophils (neutropenia), \n- Increase in creatinine level in the blood, \n- Decrease in sodium level in the blood, \n- Breathing problems (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), \n \n\nCommon:  \n\n- Bleeding inside the skull (intraventricular haemorrhage) and brain injury (periventricular \nleukomalacia), \n\n- Bleeding in the lung, \n- Perforation of the intestine and injury of intestinal tissue (necrotizing enterocolitis), \n- Reduced volume of urine passed, blood in the urine, fluid retention \n \n\nUncommon:  \n\n- Acute failure of the kidney’s functions \n- Bleeding in the intestine \n- Below normal oxygen content in the arterial blood (hypoxemia) \n \n\nNot known: \n\n- Perforation of the stomach \n \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \n\nyour baby’s doctor or your pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. HOW TO STORE PEDEA \n \n\nKeep out of reach and sight of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use Pedea after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n\n \n\nAfter opening, Pedea should be administered immediately. \n\n \n\nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n6.

Ampoules are intended for single use only, any unused \n\nportions must be discarded. \n\n \n\nPosology and method of administration (see also section 3) \n \n\nFor intravenous use only. Treatment with Pedea can only be carried out in a neonatal intensive care \n\nunit under the supervision of an experienced neonatologist. \n\nA course of therapy is defined as three intravenous doses of Pedea given at 24-hour intervals. \n\nThe ibuprofen dose is adjusted to the body weight as follows: \n\n- 1st injection: 10 mg/kg, \n\n- 2nd and 3rd injections: 5 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nIf the ductus arteriosus does not close 48 hours after the last injection or if it re-opens, a second course \n\nof 3 doses, as above, may be given. \n\nIf the condition is unchanged after the second course of therapy, surgery of the PDA may then be \n\nnecessary. \n\nIf anuria or manifest oliguria occurs after the first or second dose, the next dose should be withheld \n\nuntil urine output returns to normal levels. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration: \n\nPedea should be administered as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. To facilitate \n\nthe administration an infusion pump may be used. \n\nIf necessary, the injection volume may be adjusted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. Any unused portion of the \n\nsolution should be discarded. \n\nThe total volume of solution injected to preterm infants should take into account the total daily fluid \n\nvolume administered. A maximal volume of 80 ml/kg/day on the first day of life should usually be \n\nrespected; this should be progressively increased in the following 1-2 weeks (about 20 ml/kg \n\nbirthweight/day) up to a maximal volume of 180 ml/kg birthweight/day. \n\n \n\nIncompatibilities \n \n\nChlorhexidine must not be used to disinfect the neck of the ampoule as it is not compatible with the \n\nPedea solution. Therefore, for asepsis of the ampoule before use, ethanol 60% or isopropyl alcohol \n\n70% is recommended. \n\nWhen disinfecting the neck of the ampoule with an antiseptic, to avoid any interaction with the Pedea \n\nsolution, the ampoule must be completely dry before it is opened. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nIn order to avoid any substantial variation of pH due to the presence of acidic medicinal products that \n\ncould remain in the infusion line, the latter must be rinsed before and after administration of Pedea \n\nwith 1.5 to 2 ml of either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml \n\n(5%) solution. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
