QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 20 mg basiliximab*. \n\n \n\nOne ml of the reconstituted solution contains 4 mg basiliximab. \n\n \n\n* recombinant murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-2 \n\nreceptor -chain (CD25 antigen) produced in a mouse myeloma cell line by recombinant DNA \n\ntechnology. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection or infusion \n\n \n\nWhite powder \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nSimulect is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal \n\ntransplantation in adult and paediatric patients (1-17 years) (see section 4.2). It is to be used \n\nconcomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in \n\npatients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive \n\nregimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or \n\nmycophenolate mofetil. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nSimulect should be prescribed only by physicians who are experienced in the use of \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. Simulect should be administered under \n\nqualified medical supervision. \n\n \n\nSimulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft \n\nand concomitant immunosuppression. \n\n \n\nSimulect is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based \n\nimmunosuppression. It can be used in a ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based triple \n\nimmunosuppressive regimen including azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe standard total dose is 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. \n\n \n\nThe first 20 mg dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second \n\n20 mg dose should be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the \n\nevent of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft \n\nloss (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (1–17 years) \n\nIn paediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg, the recommended total dose is 20 mg, given in two \n\ndoses of 10 mg each. In paediatric patients weighing 35 kg or more, the recommended dose is the \n\nadult dose, i.e. a total dose of 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. \n\n \n\nThe first dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second dose should \n\nbe given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the event of a severe \n\nhypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft loss (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly ( 65 years) \nThere are limited data available on the use of Simulect in the elderly, but there is no evidence that \n\nelderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nReconstituted Simulect can be administered as an intravenous bolus injection or as an intravenous \n\ninfusion over 20–30 minutes. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPatients receiving Simulect must be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate \n\nlaboratory and supportive medical resources, including medications for the treatment of severe \n\nhypersensitivity reactions. \n\n \n\nImmunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medications increase the susceptibility to \n\ninfection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis; the risk increased with total \n\nimmunosuppressive load. \n\n \n\nSimulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft \n\nand concomitant immunosuppression. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nSevere acute (less than 24 hours) hypersensitivity reactions have been observed both on initial \n\nexposure to Simulect and on re-exposure to a subsequent course of therapy. These included \n\nanaphylactoid-type reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, hypotension, \n\ntachycardia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, respiratory failure and \n\ncapillary leak syndrome. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, therapy with Simulect must be \n\npermanently discontinued and no further dose be administered. Caution should be exercised when \n\npatients previously given Simulect are re-exposed to a subsequent course of therapy with this \n\nmedicinal product. There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients is at an increased risk \n\nof developing hypersensitivity reactions. These are patients in whom, following the initial \n\nadministration of Simulect, the concomitant immunosuppression was discontinued prematurely due, \n\nfor example, to abandoned transplantation or early loss of the graft. Acute hypersensitivity reactions \n\nwere observed on re-administration of Simulect for a subsequent transplantation in some of these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nNeoplasms and infections \n\n \n\nTransplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations with or without \n\nbasiliximab are at increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (such as \n\nlymphoma) and opportunistic infections (such as cytomegalovirus [CMV], BK virus). In clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of opportunistic infections was similar in patients using immunosuppressive regimens \n\nwith or without Simulect. In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension studies, no differences were \n\nfound in the incidence of malignancies and LPDs between immunosuppressive regimens with or \n\nwithout combination of basiliximab (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nVaccination \n\n \n\nNo data are available on either the effects of live and inactive vaccination or the transmission of \n\ninfection by live vaccines in patients receiving Simulect. Nevertheless, live vaccines are not \n\nrecommended for immunosuppressed patients. The use of live attenuated vaccines should therefore be \n\navoided in patients treated with Simulect. Inactivated vaccines may be administered to \n\nimmunosuppressed patients; however, response to the vaccine may depend on the degree of the \n\nimmunosuppression, therefore vaccination during treatment with Simulect may be less effective. \n\n \n\nUse in heart transplantation \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Simulect for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in recipients of solid organ \n\nallografts other than renal have not been demonstrated. In several small clinical trials in heart \n\ntransplant recipients, serious cardiac adverse events such as cardiac arrest (2.2%), atrial flutter (1.9%) \n\nand palpitations (1.4%) have been reported more frequently with Simulect than with other induction \n\nagents. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nBecause basiliximab is an immunoglobulin, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are to be expected. \n\n \n\nIn addition to ciclosporin for microemulsion, steroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, other \n\nconcomitant medications routinely administered in organ transplantation have been administered in \n\nclinical trials without any incremental adverse reactions. These concomitant medications include \n\nsystemic antiviral, antibacterial and antimycotic medications, analgesics, antihypertensive medications \n\nsuch as beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHuman antimurine antibody (HAMA) responses were reported in a clinical trial of 172 patients treated \n\nwith basiliximab, without predictive value for clinical tolerability. The incidence was 2/138 in patients \n\nnot exposed to muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) and 4/34 in patients who received muromonab-CD3 \n\nconcomitantly. The use of basiliximab does not preclude subsequent treatment with murine \n\nantilymphocyte antibody preparations. \n\n \n\nIn the original phase III studies during the first 3 months post-transplantation, 14% of patients in the \n\nbasiliximab group and 27% of patients in the placebo group had an acute rejection episode treated with \n\nantibody therapy (OKT 3 or antithymocyte globulin/antilymphocyte globulin [ATG/ALG]), with no \n\nincrease in adverse events or infections in the basiliximab group as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nThree clinical trials have investigated basiliximab use in combination with a triple therapy regimen \n\nwhich included either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The total body clearance of basiliximab \n\nwas reduced by an average 22% when azathioprine was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin \n\nfor microemulsion and corticosteroids. The total body clearance of basiliximab was reduced by an \n\naverage 51% when mycophenolate mofetil was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin for \n\nmicroemulsion and corticosteroids. The use of basiliximab in a triple therapy regimen including \n\nazathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil did not increase adverse events or infections in the basiliximab \n\ngroup as compared to placebo (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nSimulect is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3). Basiliximab has potentially \n\nhazardous immunosuppressive effects with respect to the course of gestation and the suckling neonate \n\nexposed to basiliximab in breast milk. Women of childbearing potential must use effective \n\ncontraception during and up to 16 weeks after treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is no animal or human data available concerning excretion of basiliximab into breast milk. \n\nHowever, based on the IgG1 nature of basiliximab, excretion into milk should be expected. Breast-\n\nfeeding must therefore be avoided. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nBasiliximab has been tested in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in renal \n\ntransplant recipients as an induction agent in combination with the following immunosuppressive \n\nregimens: ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids in two studies (346 and 380 patients), \n\nciclosporin for microemulsion, azathioprine and corticosteroids in one study (340 patients), and \n\nciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in another study \n\n(123 patients). Safety data in paediatric patients have been obtained from one open-label \n\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in renal transplant recipients (41 patients). \n\n \n\nIncidence of adverse events: In the above four placebo-controlled trials, the pattern of adverse events \n\nin 590 patients treated with the recommended dose of basiliximab was comparable to that observed in \n\n595 patients treated with placebo. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events among all \n\npatients in the individual studies was not significantly different between the basiliximab (7.1% - 40%) \n\nand the placebo (7.6% - 39%) treatment groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdult patients \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual or triple therapy in both treatment groups \n\n(basiliximab vs. placebo) were constipation, urinary tract infection, pain, nausea, peripheral oedema, \n\nhypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperkalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, postoperative wound \n\ncomplication, weight increase, increase in blood creatinine, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea and upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual therapy in both (< 35 kg vs.  35 kg \n\nweight) cohorts were urinary tract infection, hypertrichosis, rhinitis, pyrexia, hypertension, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis and constipation. \n\n \n\nIncidence of malignant neoplasms: The overall incidence of malignancies among all patients in the \n\nindividual studies was similar between the basiliximab and the comparator treatment groups. Overall, \n\nlymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease occurred in 0.1% (1/701) of patients in the basiliximab group \n\ncompared with 0.3% (2/595) of patients receiving placebo, both in combination with dual and triple \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy. Other malignancies were reported among 1.0% (7/701) of patients in the \n\nbasiliximab group compared with 1.2% (7/595) of placebo patients. In a pooled analysis of two five-\n\nyear extension studies, the incidence of LPDs and cancer was found to be equal with basiliximab 7% \n\n(21/295) and placebo 7% (21/291) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncidence of infectious episodes: The overall incidence and profile of viral, bacterial and fungal \n\ninfections among patients treated with basiliximab or placebo in combination with dual and triple \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy was comparable between the groups. The overall incidence of infections \n\nwas 75.9% in the basiliximab group and 75.6% in the placebo group and the incidence of serious \n\ninfections was 26.1% and 24.8%, respectively. The incidence of CMV infections was similar in both \n\ngroups (14.6% vs. 17.3%), following either dual or triple therapy regimen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe incidence and causes of deaths following dual or triple therapy were similar in basiliximab (2.9%) \n\nand placebo groups (2.6%), with the most common cause of deaths in both treatment groups being \n\ninfections (basiliximab = 1.3%, placebo = 1.4%). In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension \n\nstudies the incidence and cause of death remained similar in both treatment groups, (basiliximab 15%, \n\nplacebo 11%), the primary cause of death being cardiac-related disorders such as cardiac failure and \n\nmyocardial infarction (basiliximab 5%, placebo 4%). \n\n \n\nListing of adverse reactions from post-marketing spontaneous reports \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified based on post-marketing spontaneous reports and \n\nare organised by system organ class. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a \n\npopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, \n\nbronchospasm, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory \n\nfailure, capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4). Cytokine release syndrome. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies basiliximab has been administered to humans in single doses of up to 60 mg and \n\nmultiple doses of up to 150 mg over 24 days with no acute undesirable effects. \n\n \n\nFor information on preclinical toxicology see section 5.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC02. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nBasiliximab is a murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that is directed against the \n\ninterleukin-2 receptor -chain (CD25 antigen), which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes in \n\nresponse to antigenic challenge. Basiliximab specifically binds with high affinity (KD-value 0.1 nM) to \n\nthe CD25 antigen on activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-\n\n2R) and thereby prevents binding of interleukin-2, a critical signal for T-cell proliferation in the \n\ncellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Complete and consistent blocking of the \n\ninterleukin-2 receptor is maintained as long as serum basiliximab levels exceed 0.2 g/ml (usually up \n\nto 4–6 weeks after administration). As concentrations fall below this level, expression of the CD25 \n\nantigen returns to pretherapy values within 1–2 weeks. Basiliximab does not cause myelosuppression. \n\n \n\nClinical studies \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of basiliximab in prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo renal transplantation has been \n\ndemonstrated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Results from two pivotal 12-month \n\nmulticentre studies (722 patients in total) comparing basiliximab with placebo show that basiliximab, \n\nused concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids, significantly reduces the \n\nincidence of acute rejection episodes both within 6 (31% vs. 45%, p<0.001) and 12 (33% vs. 48%, \n\np<0.001) months after transplantation. There was no significant difference between basiliximab and \n\nplacebo-treated patients in graft survival after 6 and 12 months (at 12 months 32 graft losses on \n\nbasiliximab (9%) and 37 graft losses on placebo (10%)). The incidence of acute rejection episode was \n\nsubstantially lower in patients receiving basiliximab and a triple drug immunosuppressive regimen. \n\n \n\nResults from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients \n\nin total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within \n\n6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, \n\ncorticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs. 35%) or mycophenolate mofetil (15% vs. 27%). Graft \n\nloss occurred in 6% of basiliximab-treated and 10% of placebo-treated patients by 6 months. The \n\nadverse event profile remained comparable between treatment groups. \n\n \n\nIn a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label extension studies (586 patients total) the combined \n\ngraft and patient survival rates were not statistically different for the basiliximab and placebo groups. \n\nExtension studies also showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection episode during the first \n\nyear after transplantation experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-year follow-up period \n\nthan patients who had no rejection. These events were not influenced by basiliximab. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of basiliximab were evaluated in two paediatric studies. \n\n \n\nBasiliximab was used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and steroids in an \n\nuncontrolled study in 41 paediatric de novo renal transplant recipients. Acute rejection occurred in \n\n14.6% of patients by 6 months post-transplantation, and in 24.3% by 12 months. Overall the adverse \n\nevent profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the paediatric renal transplantation \n\npopulation and with the profile in the controlled adult transplantation studies. \n\n \n\nA 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study investigated basiliximab \n\nin combination with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids in paediatric \n\nrenal allograft recipients. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of this \n\ncombination versus treatment with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids \n\nin the prevention of acute rejections. Of the 202 patients, 104 were randomised to basiliximab and 98 \n\nto placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episode \n\nor treatment failure defined as graft loss, death or presumptive rejection within the first 6 months post \n\ntransplantation, occurred in 16.7% of basiliximab-treated patients and 21.7% of placebo-treated \n\npatients. When borderline rejections were included in the primary efficacy endpoint, the rates were \n\n26.0% and 23.9% respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the basiliximab- \n\nand placebo-treated groups (HR: 1.04, 90% CI: [0.64; 1.68]). The rates of BPAR were 9.4% in the \n\nbasiliximab group and 17.4% in the placebo group (HR: 0.50, 90% CI: [0.25; 0.99]). When borderline \n\nrejections were included, the rates were 20.8% and 19.6% respectively (HR: 1.01, 90% CI: [0.59; \n\n1.72]). The overall safety profiles were similar in both groups. The incidence rates of adverse events \n\nand the pattern of adverse events were comparable between the two treatment groups and to be \n\nexpected for the treatment regimens and the underlying diseases. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nOf 339 renal transplant patients treated with basiliximab and tested for anti-idiotype antibodies, 4 \n\n(1.2%) developed an anti-idiotype antibody response. In a clinical trial with 172 patients receiving \n\nbasiliximab, the incidence of human antimurine antibody (HAMA) in renal transplantation patients \n\ntreated with basiliximab was 2/138 in patients not exposed to muromonab-CD3 and 4/34 in patients \n\nwho received muromonab-CD3 concomitantly. The available clinical data on the use of muromonab-\n\nCD3 in patients previously treated with basiliximab suggest that subsequent use of muromonab-CD3 \n\nor other murine anti-lymphocytic antibody preparations is not precluded. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n \n\nSingle-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in adult patients \n\nundergoing kidney transplantation. Cumulative doses ranged from 20 mg up to 60 mg. Peak serum \n\nconcentration following intravenous infusion of 20 mg over 30 minutes is 7.15.1 mg/l. There is a \n\nproportional increase in Cmax and AUC from 20 mg to 60 mg, the range of single-dose administrations \n\ntested. The volume of distribution at steady state was 8.64.1 l. The extent and degree of distribution \n\nto various body compartments have not been fully studied. In vitro studies using human tissues \n\nindicate that basiliximab binds only to activated lymphocytes and macrophages/monocytes. The \n\nterminal half-life was 7.23.2 days. Total body clearance was 4119 ml/h. \n\n \n\nNo clinically relevant influence of body weight or gender on distribution volume or clearance has been \n\nobserved in adult patients. Elimination half-life was not influenced by age, gender, or race. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of basiliximab were assessed in 39 paediatric de novo renal transplantation \n\npatients. In infants and children (age 1–11 years, n=25), the steady-state distribution volume was \n\n4.82.1 l, half-life was 9.54.5 days and clearance was 176 ml/h. Distribution volume and clearance \n\nare reduced by about 50% compared to adult renal transplantation patients. Disposition parameters \n\nwere not influenced to a clinically relevant extent by age (1–11 years), body weight (9–37 kg) or body \n\nsurface area (0.44–1.20 m) in this age group. In adolescents (age 12–16 years, n=14), the steady-state \n\ndistribution volume was 7.85.1 l, half-life was 9.13.9 days and clearance was 3119 ml/h. \n\nDisposition in adolescents was similar to that in adult renal transplantation patients. The relationship \n\nbetween serum concentration and receptor saturation was assessed in 13 patients and was similar to \n\nthat characterised in adult renal transplantation patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNo toxicity was observed when rhesus monkeys received intravenous doses of either up to 5 mg/kg \n\nbasiliximab twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week withdrawal period or 24 mg/kg \n\nbasiliximab weekly for 39 weeks followed by a 13-week withdrawal period. In the 39-week study, the \n\nhighest dose resulted in approximately 1,000 times the systemic exposure (AUC) observed in patients \n\ngiven the recommended clinical dose together with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n \n\nNo maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed in cynomolgous monkeys \n\nfollowing injections of up to 5 mg/kg basiliximab administered twice weekly during the organogenesis \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic potential was observed in vitro. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nSimulect is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal \n\ntransplantation in adult and paediatric patients (1-17 years) (see section 4.2). It is to be used \n\nconcomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in \n\npatients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive \n\nregimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or \n\nmycophenolate mofetil. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nSimulect should be prescribed only by physicians who are experienced in the use of \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation. Simulect should be administered under \n\nqualified medical supervision. \n\n \n\nSimulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft \n\nand concomitant immunosuppression. \n\n \n\nSimulect is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based \n\nimmunosuppression. It can be used in a ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based triple \n\nimmunosuppressive regimen including azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (1–17 years) \n\nIn paediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg, the recommended total dose is 20 mg, given in two \n\ndoses of 10 mg each. In paediatric patients weighing 35 kg or more, the recommended dose is the \n\nadult dose, i.e. a total dose of 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. \n\n \n\nThe first dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second dose should \n\nbe given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the event of a severe \n\nhypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft loss (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe standard total dose is 40 mg, given in two doses of 20 mg each. \n\n \n\nThe first 20 mg dose should be given within 2 hours prior to transplantation surgery. The second \n\n20 mg dose should be given 4 days after transplantation. The second dose should be withheld in the \n\nevent of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Simulect or post-operative complications such as graft \n\nloss (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years) \n\nThere are limited data available on the use of Simulect in the elderly, but there is no evidence that \n\nelderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nReconstituted Simulect can be administered as an intravenous bolus injection or as an intravenous \n\ninfusion over 20–30 minutes. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPatients receiving Simulect must be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate \n\nlaboratory and supportive medical resources, including medications for the treatment of severe \n\nhypersensitivity reactions. \n\n \n\nImmunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medications increase the susceptibility to \n\ninfection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis; the risk increased with total \n\nimmunosuppressive load. \n\n \n\nSimulect must not be administered unless it is absolutely certain that the patient will receive the graft \n\nand concomitant immunosuppression. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nSevere acute (less than 24 hours) hypersensitivity reactions have been observed both on initial \n\nexposure to Simulect and on re-exposure to a subsequent course of therapy. These included \n\nanaphylactoid-type reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, hypotension, \n\ntachycardia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, respiratory failure and \n\ncapillary leak syndrome. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, therapy with Simulect must be \n\npermanently discontinued and no further dose be administered. Caution should be exercised when \n\npatients previously given Simulect are re-exposed to a subsequent course of therapy with this \n\nmedicinal product. There is accumulating evidence that a subgroup of patients is at an increased risk \n\nof developing hypersensitivity reactions. These are patients in whom, following the initial \n\nadministration of Simulect, the concomitant immunosuppression was discontinued prematurely due, \n\nfor example, to abandoned transplantation or early loss of the graft. Acute hypersensitivity reactions \n\nwere observed on re-administration of Simulect for a subsequent transplantation in some of these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nNeoplasms and infections \n\n \n\nTransplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations with or without \n\nbasiliximab are at increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (such as \n\nlymphoma) and opportunistic infections (such as cytomegalovirus [CMV], BK virus). In clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of opportunistic infections was similar in patients using immunosuppressive regimens \n\nwith or without Simulect. In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension studies, no differences were \n\nfound in the incidence of malignancies and LPDs between immunosuppressive regimens with or \n\nwithout combination of basiliximab (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nVaccination \n\n \n\nNo data are available on either the effects of live and inactive vaccination or the transmission of \n\ninfection by live vaccines in patients receiving Simulect. Nevertheless, live vaccines are not \n\nrecommended for immunosuppressed patients. The use of live attenuated vaccines should therefore be \n\navoided in patients treated with Simulect. Inactivated vaccines may be administered to \n\nimmunosuppressed patients; however, response to the vaccine may depend on the degree of the \n\nimmunosuppression, therefore vaccination during treatment with Simulect may be less effective. \n\n \n\nUse in heart transplantation \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Simulect for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in recipients of solid organ \n\nallografts other than renal have not been demonstrated. In several small clinical trials in heart \n\ntransplant recipients, serious cardiac adverse events such as cardiac arrest (2.2%), atrial flutter (1.9%) \n\nand palpitations (1.4%) have been reported more frequently with Simulect than with other induction \n\nagents. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nBecause basiliximab is an immunoglobulin, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are to be expected. \n\n \n\nIn addition to ciclosporin for microemulsion, steroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, other \n\nconcomitant medications routinely administered in organ transplantation have been administered in \n\nclinical trials without any incremental adverse reactions. These concomitant medications include \n\nsystemic antiviral, antibacterial and antimycotic medications, analgesics, antihypertensive medications \n\nsuch as beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nHuman antimurine antibody (HAMA) responses were reported in a clinical trial of 172 patients treated \n\nwith basiliximab, without predictive value for clinical tolerability. The incidence was 2/138 in patients \n\nnot exposed to muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) and 4/34 in patients who received muromonab-CD3 \n\nconcomitantly. The use of basiliximab does not preclude subsequent treatment with murine \n\nantilymphocyte antibody preparations. \n\n \n\nIn the original phase III studies during the first 3 months post-transplantation, 14% of patients in the \n\nbasiliximab group and 27% of patients in the placebo group had an acute rejection episode treated with \n\nantibody therapy (OKT 3 or antithymocyte globulin/antilymphocyte globulin [ATG/ALG]), with no \n\nincrease in adverse events or infections in the basiliximab group as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nThree clinical trials have investigated basiliximab use in combination with a triple therapy regimen \n\nwhich included either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The total body clearance of basiliximab \n\nwas reduced by an average 22% when azathioprine was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin \n\nfor microemulsion and corticosteroids. The total body clearance of basiliximab was reduced by an \n\naverage 51% when mycophenolate mofetil was added to a regimen consisting of ciclosporin for \n\nmicroemulsion and corticosteroids. The use of basiliximab in a triple therapy regimen including \n\nazathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil did not increase adverse events or infections in the basiliximab \n\ngroup as compared to placebo (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nSimulect is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3). Basiliximab has potentially \n\nhazardous immunosuppressive effects with respect to the course of gestation and the suckling neonate \n\nexposed to basiliximab in breast milk. Women of childbearing potential must use effective \n\ncontraception during and up to 16 weeks after treatment. \n\n \n\nThere is no animal or human data available concerning excretion of basiliximab into breast milk. \n\nHowever, based on the IgG1 nature of basiliximab, excretion into milk should be expected. Breast-\n\nfeeding must therefore be avoided. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nBasiliximab has been tested in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in renal \n\ntransplant recipients as an induction agent in combination with the following immunosuppressive \n\nregimens: ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids in two studies (346 and 380 patients), \n\nciclosporin for microemulsion, azathioprine and corticosteroids in one study (340 patients), and \n\nciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in another study \n\n(123 patients). Safety data in paediatric patients have been obtained from one open-label \n\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in renal transplant recipients (41 patients). \n\n \n\nIncidence of adverse events: In the above four placebo-controlled trials, the pattern of adverse events \n\nin 590 patients treated with the recommended dose of basiliximab was comparable to that observed in \n\n595 patients treated with placebo. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events among all \n\npatients in the individual studies was not significantly different between the basiliximab (7.1% - 40%) \n\nand the placebo (7.6% - 39%) treatment groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAdult patients \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual or triple therapy in both treatment groups \n\n(basiliximab vs. placebo) were constipation, urinary tract infection, pain, nausea, peripheral oedema, \n\nhypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperkalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, postoperative wound \n\ncomplication, weight increase, increase in blood creatinine, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea and upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual therapy in both (< 35 kg vs.  35 kg \n\nweight) cohorts were urinary tract infection, hypertrichosis, rhinitis, pyrexia, hypertension, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis and constipation. \n\n \n\nIncidence of malignant neoplasms: The overall incidence of malignancies among all patients in the \n\nindividual studies was similar between the basiliximab and the comparator treatment groups. Overall, \n\nlymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease occurred in 0.1% (1/701) of patients in the basiliximab group \n\ncompared with 0.3% (2/595) of patients receiving placebo, both in combination with dual and triple \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy. Other malignancies were reported among 1.0% (7/701) of patients in the \n\nbasiliximab group compared with 1.2% (7/595) of placebo patients. In a pooled analysis of two five-\n\nyear extension studies, the incidence of LPDs and cancer was found to be equal with basiliximab 7% \n\n(21/295) and placebo 7% (21/291) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIncidence of infectious episodes: The overall incidence and profile of viral, bacterial and fungal \n\ninfections among patients treated with basiliximab or placebo in combination with dual and triple \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy was comparable between the groups. The overall incidence of infections \n\nwas 75.9% in the basiliximab group and 75.6% in the placebo group and the incidence of serious \n\ninfections was 26.1% and 24.8%, respectively. The incidence of CMV infections was similar in both \n\ngroups (14.6% vs. 17.3%), following either dual or triple therapy regimen (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe incidence and causes of deaths following dual or triple therapy were similar in basiliximab (2.9%) \n\nand placebo groups (2.6%), with the most common cause of deaths in both treatment groups being \n\ninfections (basiliximab = 1.3%, placebo = 1.4%). In a pooled analysis of two five-year extension \n\nstudies the incidence and cause of death remained similar in both treatment groups, (basiliximab 15%, \n\nplacebo 11%), the primary cause of death being cardiac-related disorders such as cardiac failure and \n\nmyocardial infarction (basiliximab 5%, placebo 4%). \n\n \n\nListing of adverse reactions from post-marketing spontaneous reports \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified based on post-marketing spontaneous reports and \n\nare organised by system organ class. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a \n\npopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions such as rash, urticaria, pruritus, sneezing, wheezing, \n\nbronchospasm, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, hypotension, tachycardia, respiratory \n\nfailure, capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4). Cytokine release syndrome. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies basiliximab has been administered to humans in single doses of up to 60 mg and \n\nmultiple doses of up to 150 mg over 24 days with no acute undesirable effects. \n\n \n\nFor information on preclinical toxicology see section 5.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC02. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nBasiliximab is a murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that is directed against the \n\ninterleukin-2 receptor -chain (CD25 antigen), which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes in \n\nresponse to antigenic challenge. Basiliximab specifically binds with high affinity (KD-value 0.1 nM) to \n\nthe CD25 antigen on activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-\n\n2R) and thereby prevents binding of interleukin-2, a critical signal for T-cell proliferation in the \n\ncellular immune response involved in allograft rejection. Complete and consistent blocking of the \n\ninterleukin-2 receptor is maintained as long as serum basiliximab levels exceed 0.2 g/ml (usually up \n\nto 4–6 weeks after administration). As concentrations fall below this level, expression of the CD25 \n\nantigen returns to pretherapy values within 1–2 weeks. Basiliximab does not cause myelosuppression. \n\n \n\nClinical studies \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of basiliximab in prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo renal transplantation has been \n\ndemonstrated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Results from two pivotal 12-month \n\nmulticentre studies (722 patients in total) comparing basiliximab with placebo show that basiliximab, \n\nused concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids, significantly reduces the \n\nincidence of acute rejection episodes both within 6 (31% vs. 45%, p<0.001) and 12 (33% vs. 48%, \n\np<0.001) months after transplantation. There was no significant difference between basiliximab and \n\nplacebo-treated patients in graft survival after 6 and 12 months (at 12 months 32 graft losses on \n\nbasiliximab (9%) and 37 graft losses on placebo (10%)). The incidence of acute rejection episode was \n\nsubstantially lower in patients receiving basiliximab and a triple drug immunosuppressive regimen. \n\n \n\nResults from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients \n\nin total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within \n\n6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, \n\ncorticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs. 35%) or mycophenolate mofetil (15% vs. 27%). Graft \n\nloss occurred in 6% of basiliximab-treated and 10% of placebo-treated patients by 6 months. The \n\nadverse event profile remained comparable between treatment groups. \n\n \n\nIn a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label extension studies (586 patients total) the combined \n\ngraft and patient survival rates were not statistically different for the basiliximab and placebo groups. \n\nExtension studies also showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection episode during the first \n\nyear after transplantation experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-year follow-up period \n\nthan patients who had no rejection. These events were not influenced by basiliximab. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of basiliximab were evaluated in two paediatric studies. \n\n \n\nBasiliximab was used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and steroids in an \n\nuncontrolled study in 41 paediatric de novo renal transplant recipients. Acute rejection occurred in \n\n14.6% of patients by 6 months post-transplantation, and in 24.3% by 12 months. Overall the adverse \n\nevent profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the paediatric renal transplantation \n\npopulation and with the profile in the controlled adult transplantation studies. \n\n \n\nA 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study investigated basiliximab \n\nin combination with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids in paediatric \n\nrenal allograft recipients. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of this \n\ncombination versus treatment with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids \n\nin the prevention of acute rejections. Of the 202 patients, 104 were randomised to basiliximab and 98 \n\nto placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episode \n\nor treatment failure defined as graft loss, death or presumptive rejection within the first 6 months post \n\ntransplantation, occurred in 16.7% of basiliximab-treated patients and 21.7% of placebo-treated \n\npatients. When borderline rejections were included in the primary efficacy endpoint, the rates were \n\n26.0% and 23.9% respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the basiliximab- \n\nand placebo-treated groups (HR: 1.04, 90% CI: [0.64; 1.68]). The rates of BPAR were 9.4% in the \n\nbasiliximab group and 17.4% in the placebo group (HR: 0.50, 90% CI: [0.25; 0.99]). When borderline \n\nrejections were included, the rates were 20.8% and 19.6%, respectively (HR: 1.01, 90% CI: [0.59; \n\n1.72]). The overall safety profiles were similar in both groups. The incidence rates of adverse events \n\nand the pattern of adverse events were comparable between the two treatment groups and to be \n\nexpected for the treatment regimens and the underlying diseases. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nOf 339 renal transplant patients treated with basiliximab and tested for anti-idiotype antibodies, 4 \n\n(1.2%) developed an anti-idiotype antibody response. In a clinical trial with 172 patients receiving \n\nbasiliximab, the incidence of human antimurine antibody (HAMA) in renal transplantation patients \n\ntreated with basiliximab was 2/138 in patients not exposed to muromonab-CD3 and 4/34 in patients \n\nwho received muromonab-CD3 concomitantly. The available clinical data on the use of muromonab-\n\nCD3 in patients previously treated with basiliximab suggest that subsequent use of muromonab-CD3 \n\nor other murine anti-lymphocytic antibody preparations is not precluded. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n \n\nSingle-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in adult patients \n\nundergoing kidney transplantation. Cumulative doses ranged from 20 mg up to 60 mg. Peak serum \n\nconcentration following intravenous infusion of 20 mg over 30 minutes is 7.15.1 mg/l. There is a \n\nproportional increase in Cmax and AUC from 20 mg to 60 mg, the range of single-dose administrations \n\ntested. The volume of distribution at steady state was 8.64.1 l. The extent and degree of distribution \n\nto various body compartments have not been fully studied. In vitro studies using human tissues \n\nindicate that basiliximab binds only to activated lymphocytes and macrophages/monocytes. The \n\nterminal half-life was 7.23.2 days. Total body clearance was 4119 ml/h. \n\n \n\nNo clinically relevant influence of body weight or gender on distribution volume or clearance has been \n\nobserved in adult patients. Elimination half-life was not influenced by age, gender, or race. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of basiliximab were assessed in 39 paediatric de novo renal transplantation \n\npatients. In infants and children (age 1–11 years, n=25), the steady-state distribution volume was \n\n4.82.1 l, half-life was 9.54.5 days and clearance was 176 ml/h. Distribution volume and clearance \n\nare reduced by about 50% compared to adult renal transplantation patients. Disposition parameters \n\nwere not influenced to a clinically relevant extent by age (1–11 years), body weight (9–37 kg) or body \n\nsurface area (0.44–1.20 m) in this age group. In adolescents (age 12–16 years, n=14), the steady-state \n\ndistribution volume was 7.85.1 l, half-life was 9.13.9 days and clearance was 3119 ml/h. \n\nDisposition in adolescents was similar to that in adult renal transplantation patients. The relationship \n\nbetween serum concentration and receptor saturation was assessed in 13 patients and was similar to \n\nthat characterised in adult renal transplantation patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNo toxicity was observed when rhesus monkeys received intravenous doses of either up to 5 mg/kg \n\nbasiliximab twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week withdrawal period or 24 mg/kg \n\nbasiliximab weekly for 39 weeks followed by a 13-week withdrawal period. In the 39-week study, the \n\nhighest dose resulted in approximately 1,000 times the systemic exposure (AUC) observed in patients \n\ngiven the recommended clinical dose together with concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n \n\nNo maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed in cynomolgous monkeys \n\nfollowing injections of up to 5 mg/kg basiliximab administered twice weekly during the organogenesis \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic potential was observed in vitro. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Simulect is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSimulect belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. It is given in hospital to adults, \n\nadolescents and children who are having a kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants reduce the body’s \n\nresponse to anything that it sees as “foreign” – which includes transplanted organs. The body’s \n\nimmune system thinks a transplanted organ is a foreign body and will try to reject it. Simulect works \n\nby stopping the immune cells that attack transplanted organs. \n\n \n\nYou will only be given two doses of Simulect. These will be given in hospital, around the time of your \n\ntransplant operation. Simulect is given to stop your body from rejecting the new organ during the first \n\n4 to 6 weeks after the transplant operation, when rejection is most likely. You will be given other \n\nmedicines to help protect your new kidney during this time, such as ciclosporin and corticosteroids \n\nand after you leave hospital. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What do you need to know before you are given Simulect \n\n \n\nFollow your doctor’s instructions carefully. If you are unsure about anything, ask your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\nYou must not be given Simulect \n\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to basiliximab or any of the other ingredients of Simulect \nlisted in section 6 under “What Simulect contains”. Tell your doctor if you suspect you may \n\nhave had an allergic reaction to any of these ingredients in the past. \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n36 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Simulect: \n\n- if you have previously received a transplant that failed after only a short time or, \n- if you have previously been in the operating theatre for a transplantation that in the end was not \n\nperformed. \n\nIn this situation, you may have received Simulect. Your doctor will check this for you and discuss \n\nwith you the possibility of repeated treatment with Simulect. \n\n \n\nIf you need to have a vaccination, seek your doctor’s advice first. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Simulect \n\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nOlder patients (aged 65 years and over) \n\nSimulect can be given to older patients, but the information available is limited. Your doctor may \n\ndiscuss this with you before you are given Simulect. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\nSimulect can be given to children and adolescents. The dose for children who weigh less than 35 kg will \n\nbe smaller than the dose usually given to adults. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIt is very important to tell your doctor before your transplant if you are pregnant or you think that you \n\nmay be pregnant. You must not be given Simulect if you are pregnant. You must use adequate \n\ncontraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and up to 4 months after receiving the last dose \n\nof Simulect. If you become pregnant during this time, despite the use of contraceptive measures, you \n\nshould tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Simulect may harm your baby. You must \n\nnot breast-feed after being given Simulect or up to 4 months after the second dose. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThere is no evidence to indicate that Simulect has an effect on your ability to drive a car or use \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Simulect is given \n\n \n\nYou will only be given Simulect if you are receiving a new kidney. Simulect is given twice, in \n\nhospital, either slowly through a needle in your vein as an infusion lasting 20–30 minutes or as an \n\nintravenous injection using a syringe. \n\n \n\nIf you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to Simulect or if you had complications after your \n\nsurgery such as graft loss, the second dose of Simulect should not be given to you. \n\n \n\nThe first dose is given just before the transplant operation, and the second dose 4 days after the \n\noperation. \n\n \n\nUsual dose for adults \n\nThe usual dose for adults is 20 mg in each infusion or injection. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nUsual dose for children and adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) \n\n- For children and adolescents who weigh 35 kg or more, the dose of Simulect given in each \ninfusion or injection is 20 mg. \n\n- For children and adolescents who weigh less than 35 kg, the dose of Simulect given in each \ninfusion or injection is 10 mg. \n\n \n\nIf you are given too much Simulect \n\nAn overdose of Simulect is not likely to cause side effects straight away, but it may weaken your \n\nimmune system for longer. Your doctor will watch out for any effects on your immune system and \n\ntreat them if necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you get any unexpected symptoms while you are \n\nbeing given Simulect, or during the 8 weeks afterwards, even if you do not think that they are related \n\nto the medicine. \n\n \n\nSudden severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients treated with Simulect. If you notice \n\nsudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or \n\nother parts of the body, fast heart beat, dizziness, light headedness, shortness of breath, sneezing, \n\nwheezing or trouble breathing, severely decreased urine output, or fever and flu-like symptoms, tell \n\nyour doctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nIn adults, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, nausea, diarrhoea, weight \n\nincrease, headache, pain, swelling of hands, ankles or feet, high blood pressure, anaemia, changes in \n\nblood chemistry (e.g. potassium, cholesterol, phosphate, creatinine), surgical wound complications, \n\nand various kinds of infections. \n\n \n\nIn children, the most commonly reported side effects were constipation, excessive growth of normal \n\nhair, runny or blocked nose, fever, high blood pressure, and various kinds of infections. \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Simulect \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP.

Shake the vial gently to \n\ndissolve the powder, avoiding foaming. It is recommended that after reconstitution the colourless, \n\nclear to opalescent solution should be used immediately. Reconstituted products should be inspected \n\nvisually for particulate matter prior to administration. Do not use if foreign particles are present. After \n\nreconstitution, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C \n\nor for 4 hours at room temperature. Discard the reconstituted solution if not used within that time. \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. \n\n \n\nReconstituted Simulect is administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes or as a bolus \n\ninjection. The reconstituted solution is isotonic. For infusion, the reconstituted solution should be \n\ndiluted to a volume of 50 ml or greater with normal saline or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%). The first dose \n\nshould be given within 2 hours before transplantation surgery, and the second dose 4 days after \n\ntransplantation. The second dose should not be given if severe hypersensitivity reactions to \n\nSimulect or graft loss occur. \n\n \n\nSince no data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances, \n\nSimulect should not be mixed with other medications/substances and should always be given through \n\na separate infusion line. \n\n \n\nCompatibility with the following infusion sets has been verified: \n\n \n\nInfusion bag \n\n- Baxter minibag NaCl 0.9% \n \n\nInfusion sets \n\n- Luer Lock, H. Noolens \n- Sterile vented i.v. set, Abbott \n- Infusion set, Codan \n\n- Infusomat, Braun \n- Infusionsgerät R 87 plus, Ohmeda \n\n- Lifecare 5000Plumset Microdrip, Abbott \n- Vented basic set, Baxter \n- Flashball device, Baxter \n- Vented primary administration set, Imed \n \n\nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the pack. \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\n41 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nSimulect 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection or infusion \n\n \n\nbasiliximab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

Shake the vial gently to dissolve the powder, avoiding \n\nfoaming. It is recommended that after reconstitution the colourless, clear to opalescent solution should \n\nbe used immediately. Reconstituted products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior \n\nto administration. Do not use if foreign particles are present. After reconstitution, chemical and \n\nphysical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C or for 4 hours at room \n\ntemperature. Discard the reconstituted solution if not used within that time. From a microbiological \n\npoint of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times \n\nand conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. \n\n \n\nReconstituted Simulect is administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes or as a bolus \n\ninjection. The reconstituted solution is isotonic. For infusion, the reconstituted solution should be \n\ndiluted to a volume of 25 ml or greater with normal saline or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%). The first dose \n\nshould be given within 2 hours before transplantation surgery, and the second dose 4 days after \n\ntransplantation. The second dose should not be given if severe hypersensitivity reactions to \n\nSimulect or graft loss occur. \n\n \n\nSince no data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances, \n\nSimulect should not be mixed with other medications/substances and should always be given through \n\na separate infusion line. \n\n \n\nCompatibility with the following infusion sets has been verified: \n\n \n\nInfusion bag \n\n- Baxter minibag NaCl 0.9% \n \n\nInfusion sets \n\n- Luer Lock, H. Noolens \n- Sterile vented i.v. set, Abbott \n- Infusion set, Codan \n\n- Infusomat, Braun \n- Infusionsgerät R 87 plus, Ohmeda \n\n- Lifecare 5000Plumset Microdrip, Abbott \n- Vented basic set, Baxter \n- Flashball device, Baxter \n- Vented primary administration set, Imed \n \n\nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the pack. \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \n\n \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
