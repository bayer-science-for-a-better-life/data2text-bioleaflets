CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVizimpro, as monotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor \n(EGFR)-activating mutations.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTreatment with Vizimpro should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nEGFR mutation status should be established prior to initiation of dacomitinib therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Vizimpro is 45 mg taken orally once daily, until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity occurs.    \n \nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the \npatient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken and the next prescribed dose \nshould be taken at the usual time the next day.  \n \nDose modifications \nDose modifications may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is \nnecessary, then the dose of Vizimpro should be reduced as described in Table 1. Dose modification \nand management guidelines for specific adverse reactions are provided in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). \n \nTable 1. Recommended dose modifications for Vizimpro adverse reactions  \n \nDose level Dose (once daily) \nRecommended starting dose 45 mg  \nFirst dose reduction 30 mg \nSecond dose reduction 15 mg \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2. Dose modification and management for Vizimpro adverse reactions \n\n \nAdverse reactions Dose modification \nInterstitial lung disease \n(ILD/Pneumonitis) \n\n\uf0b7 Withhold dacomitinib during ILD/Pneumonitis diagnostic evaluation.  \n\uf0b7 Permanently discontinue dacomitinib if ILD/Pneumonitis is \n\nconfirmed. \nDiarrhoea \n \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade 1 diarrhoea, no dose modification is required. Initiate \ntreatment with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide) at \nfirst onset of diarrhoea. Encourage adequate oral fluid intake during \ndiarrhoea. \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade 2 diarrhoea, if not improved to Grade \u2264 1 within 24 hours \nwhile using anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide) and \nadequate oral fluid intake, withhold dacomitinib. Upon recovery to \nGrade \u2264 1, resume dacomitinib at the same dose level or consider a \nreduction of 1 dose level. \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade \u2265 3 diarrhoea, withhold dacomitinib. Treat with \nanti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide), and adequate \noral fluid intake or intravenous fluids or electrolytes as appropriate. \nUpon recovery to Grade \u2264 1, resume dacomitinib with a reduction of \n1 dose level. \n\nSkin-related adverse \nreactions \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade 1 rash or erythematous skin conditions, no dose \nmodification is required. Initiate treatment (e.g., antibiotics, topical \nsteroids, and emollients). \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade 1 exfoliative skin conditions, no dose modification is \nrequired. Initiate treatment (e.g., oral antibiotics and topical steroids). \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade 2 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions, no dose \nmodification is required. Initiate treatment or provide additional \ntreatment (e.g., oral antibiotics and topical steroids).  \n\n\uf0b7 If Grade 2 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions persist for \n72 hours despite treatment, withhold dacomitinib. Upon recovery to \nGrade \u2264 1, resume dacomitinib at the same dose level or consider a \nreduction of 1 dose level.  \n\n\uf0b7 For Grade \u2265 3 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions, \nwithhold dacomitinib. Initiate or continue treatment and/or provide \nadditional treatment (e.g., broad spectrum oral or intravenous \nantibiotics and topical steroids). Upon recovery to Grade \u2264 1, resume \ndacomitinib with a reduction of 1 dose level.  \n\nOther \uf0b7 For Grade 1 or 2 toxicity, no dose modification is required. \n\uf0b7 For Grade \u2265 3 toxicity, withhold dacomitinib until symptoms resolve \n\nto Grade \u2264 2. Upon recovery, resume dacomitinib with a reduction of \n1 dose level. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo starting dose adjustments are required when administering Vizimpro to patients with mild \n(Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. Dacomitinib has not been \nstudied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment. Treatment in this population \nis not recommended (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo starting dose adjustments are required when administering Vizimpro to patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] \u2265 30 mL/min). Limited data are available in \npatients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). No data are available in patients requiring \nhaemodialysis. Thus no dosing recommendations can be made for either patient population (see \nsection 5.2).  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nElderly population  \nNo starting dose adjustment of Vizimpro in elderly (\u2265 65 years of age) patients is required (see section \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of Vizimpro in the paediatric population (< 18 years of age) have not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nVizimpro is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed with water and can be taken with or without \nmeals.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nAssessment of EGFR mutation status \n \nWhen assessing the EGFR mutation status of a patient, it is important that a well-validated and robust \nmethodology is chosen to avoid false negative or false positive determinations. \n \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis  \n \nILD/pneumonitis, which could be fatal, has been reported in patients receiving Vizimpro (see \nsection 4.8). Patients with a history of ILD have not been studied. \n \nCareful assessment of all patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary \nsymptoms (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD/pneumonitis. Treatment \nwith dacomitinib should be withheld pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is \nconfirmed, dacomitinib should be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as \nnecessary (see section 4.2). \n \nDiarrhoea  \n \nDiarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been very commonly reported during treatment with \nVizimpro (see section 4.8). Diarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, \nwhich could be fatal if not adequately treated.  \n \nProactive management of diarrhoea should start at the first sign of diarrhoea especially within the first \n2 weeks of starting dacomitinib, including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal products and continued until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours. Anti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal products (e.g., loperamide) should be used and, if necessary, escalated to the highest \nrecommended approved dose. Patients may require dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of \ntherapy with dacomitinib. Patients should maintain adequate oral hydration and patients who become \ndehydrated may require administration of intravenous fluids and electrolytes (see section 4.2). \n \nSkin-related adverse reactions  \n \nRash, erythematous and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported in patients treated with \nVizimpro (see section 4.8). \n \nFor prevention of dry skin, initiate treatment with moisturizers, and upon development of rash, initiate \ntreatment with topical antibiotics, emollients, and topical steroids. Start oral antibiotics and topical \n\n\n\n6 \n\nsteroids in patients who develop exfoliative skin conditions. Consider adding broad spectrum oral or \nintravenous antibiotics if any of these conditions worsen to greater than or equal to Grade 2 severity. \nRash, erythematous and exfoliative skin conditions may occur or worsen in areas exposed to the sun. \nAdvise patients to use protective clothing and sunscreen before exposure to the sun. Patients may \nrequire dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of therapy with dacomitinib (see section 4.2).  \n \nHepatotoxicity and transaminases increased  \n \nTransaminases increased (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, \ntransaminases increased) have been reported during treatment with Vizimpro (see section 4.8). Among \nNSCLC patients treated with dacomitinib 45 mg daily, there have been isolated reports of \nhepatotoxicity in 4 (1.6%) patients. Across the dacomitinib program, hepatic failure led to a fatal \noutcome in 1 patient. Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. In patients who \ndevelop severe elevations in transaminases while taking dacomitinib, treatment should be interrupted \n(see section 4.2). \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 \n \nVizimpro may increase exposure (or decrease exposure of active metabolites) of other medicinal \nproducts metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of medicinal products predominantly metabolised \nby CYP2D6 should be avoided unless such products are considered necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nOther forms of interactions \n \nConcomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with dacomitinib should be avoided (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct.  \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains < 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nCo-administration of dacomitinib with agents that increase gastric pH \n \nThe aqueous solubility of dacomitinib is pH dependent, with low (acidic) pH resulting in higher \nsolubility. Data from a study in 24 healthy subjects indicated that co-administration of a single 45 mg \ndacomitinib dose with the PPI rabeprazole 40 mg once daily for 7 days decreased dacomitinib Cmax, \nAUC0-96h (area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 96 hours), and AUCinf (AUC from \ntime 0 to infinity) (n=14) by approximately 51%, 39%, and 29%, respectively, when compared to a \nsingle 45 mg dose of dacomitinib administered alone. PPIs should be avoided while receiving \ntreatment with dacomitinib (see section 4.4).  \n \nBased on data from observations in 8 patients in Study A7471001, there was no apparent effect of \nlocal antacid administration on Cmax and AUCinf of dacomitinib. Based on pooled data in patients, there \nwas no apparent effect of histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists on steady-state trough concentration \nof dacomitinib (geometric mean ratio of 86% (90% CI: 73; 101). Local antacids and H2 receptor \nantagonists may be used if needed. Dacomitinib should be administered 2 hours before or at least \n10 hours after taking H2 receptor antagonists. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCo-administration of dacomitinib and CYP2D6 substrates  \n \nCo-administration of single 45 mg oral dose of dacomitinib increased the mean exposure (AUClast and \nCmax) of dextromethorphan, a probe CYP2D6 substrate, 855% and 874%, respectively, compared with \nadministration of dextromethorphan alone. These results suggest that dacomitinib may increase \nexposure of other medicinal products (or decrease exposure to active metabolites) primarily \nmetabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of medicinal products predominantly metabolised by \nCYP2D6 should be avoided (see section 4.4). If concomitant use of such medicinal products is \nconsidered necessary, they should follow their respective labels for dose recommendation regarding \nco-administration with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors. \n \nEffect of dacomitinib on drug transporters  \n \nBased on in vitro data, dacomitinib may have the potential to inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein \n(P-gp) (in the gastrointestinal [GI] tract), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) (systemically and \nGI tract), and organic cation transporter (OCT)1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWoman of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \nVizimpro. Women of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product should use \nadequate contraceptive methods during therapy and for at least 17 days (5 half-lives) after completing \ntherapy.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of dacomitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nlimited effects on reproductive toxicity (lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption in \nrats and rabbits, and lower foetal body weight and higher incidence of unossified metatarsals in rats \nonly) (see section 5.3). Based on its mechanism of action, dacomitinib may cause foetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Dacomitinib should not be used during pregnancy. Female patients \ntaking dacomitinib during pregnancy or who become pregnant while taking dacomitinib should be \napprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is not known whether dacomitinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many \nmedicinal products are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in breast-fed infants from exposure to dacomitinib, mothers should be advised against \nbreast-feeding while receiving this medicinal product. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. Non-clinical safety studies showed \nreversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina of rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVizimpro has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue \nor ocular adverse reactions while taking dacomitinib should exercise caution when driving or \noperating machinery. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe median duration of treatment with Vizimpro across the pooled data set was 66.7 weeks. \n \nThe most common (> 20%) adverse reactions in patients receiving dacomitinib were diarrhoea \n(88.6%), rash (79.2%), stomatitis (71.8%), nail disorder (65.5%), dry skin (33.3%), decreased appetite \n(31.8%), conjunctivitis (24.7%), weight decreased (24.3%), alopecia (23.1%), pruritus (22.4%), \ntransaminases increased (22.0%), and nausea (20.4%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 6.7% of patients treated with dacomitinib.

The median \nduration of any grade and Grade \u2265 3 ILD/pneumonitis was 13 weeks and 1.5 weeks, respectively (see \nsection 4.4).  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nDiarrhoea \nDiarrhoea was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in patients receiving Vizimpro (88.6%) \nand Grade \u2265 3 diarrhoea adverse reactions were reported in 9.4% of patients. In a clinical study, one \npatient (0.4%) had a fatal outcome (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe median time to the first episode of any grade diarrhoea was 1 week and the median time to the \nworst episode of diarrhoea was 2 weeks in patients receiving dacomitinib. The median duration of any \ngrade and Grade \u2265 3 diarrhoea was 20 weeks and 1 week, respectively (see section 4.4).  \n \nSkin-related adverse reactions  \nRash, erythematous and exfoliative skin condition adverse reactions were reported in 79.2% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, of patients receiving Vizimpro. Skin-related adverse reactions were Grades 1 to 3. \nGrade 3 rash and erythematous skin condition adverse reactions were the most frequently reported \nGrade 3 adverse reactions (25.5%). Grade 3 exfoliative skin conditions were reported in 0.8% of \npatients (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe median time to the first episode of any grade rash and erythematous skin conditions was \napproximately 2 weeks and the median time to the worst episode of rash and erythematous skin \nconditions was 7 weeks in patients receiving dacomitinib. The median duration of any grade and \nGrade \u2265 3 rash and erythematous skin conditions was 53 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively. The median \ntime to the first episode of any grade exfoliative skin conditions was 6 weeks and the median time to \nthe worst episode of exfoliative skin conditions was 6 weeks. The median duration of any grade and \nGrade \u2265 3 exfoliative skin conditions was 10 weeks and approximately 2 weeks, respectively. \n \nTransaminases increased  \nTransaminases increased (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, \ntransaminases increased) were reported in 22.0% of patients receiving Vizimpro and were Grades 1 to \n3, with the majority Grade 1 (18.4%) (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe median time to the first episode of any grade of transaminases increased was approximately \n12 weeks and the median time to the worst episode of transaminases increased was 12 weeks in \npatients receiving dacomitinib. The median duration of any grade and Grade \u2265 3 transaminases \nincreased was 11 weeks and 1 week, respectively. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe adverse reactions observed at doses greater than 45 mg once daily were primarily gastrointestinal, \ndermatological, and constitutional (e.g., fatigue, malaise, and weight loss).  \n \nThere is no known antidote for dacomitinib. The treatment of dacomitinib overdose should consist of \nsymptomatic treatment and general supportive measures.  \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-neoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE47 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nDacomitinib is a pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and \nHER4) inhibitor, with activity against mutated EGFR with deletions in exon 19 or the L858R \nsubstitution in exon 21. Dacomitinib binds selectively and irreversibly to its HER family targets \nthereby providing prolonged inhibition.  \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nVizimpro in first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations (ARCHER 1050) \nThe efficacy and safety of Vizimpro was studied in a Phase 3 trial (ARCHER 1050) conducted in \npatients with locally advanced, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic \nNSCLC harbouring activating mutations of EGFR, to demonstrate the superiority of dacomitinib \nversus gefitinib. A total of 452 patients were randomised 1:1 to dacomitinib or gefitinib in a \nmulticentre, multinational, randomised, open-label Phase 3 study.  \n \nTreatment was administered orally on a continuous daily basis until disease progression, institution of \nnew anticancer therapy, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or investigator decision \ndictated by protocol compliance, whichever occurred first. Stratification factors at randomisation were \nrace (Japanese versus mainland Chinese versus other East Asian versus non-East Asian, as stated by \nthe patient), and EGFR mutation status (exon 19 deletion versus the L858R mutation in exon 21). \nEGFR mutation status was determined by a standardised and commercially available test kit.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded \nIndependent Radiology Central (IRC) review. Key secondary endpoints included objective response \nrate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS). \n \nThe demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 60% female; median age at \nenrolment was 62 years with 10.8% being \u2265 75 years old. Thirty percent had baseline Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 and 70% had ECOG PS 1; 59% had \nan exon 19 deletion, and 41% had a L858R mutation in exon 21. Race was 23% White, 77% Asian, \nand < 1% Black. Patients with brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease or ECOG PS \u2265 2 were \nexcluded from the trial. \n \nA statistically significant improvement in PFS as determined by the IRC was demonstrated for patients \nrandomised to dacomitinib compared with those randomised to gefitinib, see Table 5 and Figure 1. \nSubgroup analyses of PFS per IRC review based on baseline characteristics were consistent with those \nfrom the primary analysis of PFS. In particular, the hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS per IRC review in \nAsian and non-Asian patients were 0.509 (95% CI: 0.391, 0. 662) and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.568, 1.391), \nrespectively. In Asian patients, median PFS was 16.5 months for dacomitinib arm and 9.3 months for \ngefitinib arm. In non-Asian patients, median PFS was 9.3 months for dacomitinib arm and 9.2 months \nfor gefitinib arm. \n \nOS results from the final analysis (data cut-off date of 17-Feb-2017) when 48.7% of events had \noccurred showed a HR of 0.760 (95% CI: 0.582, 0.993) and a gain of 7.3 months in median OS \n(median OS: 34.1 months [95% CI: 29.5, 37.7] and 26.8 months [95% CI: 23.7, 32.1] in the \ndacomitinib and gefitinib arm, respectively). However, according to the hierarchical testing approach, \nthe analysis was stopped with the testing of ORR as the statistical significance was not reached. \nTherefore, the statistical significance of OS improvement could not be formally assessed. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 5.

Following dacomitinib 45 mg daily dosing, \nsteady-state was reached within 14 days. Food does not alter bioavailability to a clinically meaningful \nextent. Dacomitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport proteins P-gp and BCRP. However, \nbased on the oral bioavailability of 80%, these membrane transport proteins are unlikely to have any \nimpact on dacomitinib absorption. \n \nDistribution  \n \nDacomitinib is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady-state volume of \ndistribution of 27 L/kg (patient of 70 kg) [coefficient of variation (CV%): 18%] following intravenous \nadministration. In plasma, dacomitinib binds to albumin and \uf0611-acid glycoprotein and the fraction \nunbound is approximately 2% in vitro and ex vivo in healthy volunteers. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nIn humans, dacomitinib undergoes oxidation and glutathione conjugation as the major metabolic \npathways. Following oral administration of a single 45-mg dose of [14C] dacomitinib, the most \nabundant circulating metabolite was O-desmethyl dacomitinib. This metabolite exhibited in vitro \npharmacologic activity that was similar to that of dacomitinib in the in vitro biochemical assays. In \nfaeces, dacomitinib, O-desmethyl dacomitinib, a cysteine conjugate of dacomitinib, and a \nmono-oxygenated metabolite of dacomitinib were the major drug-related components. In vitro studies \nindicated that CYP2D6 was the major CYP isozyme involved in the formation of O-desmethyl \ndacomitinib, while CYP3A4 contributed to the formation of other minor oxidative metabolites. \nO-desmethyl dacomitinib accounted for 16% of human plasma radioactivity and is formed mainly by \nCYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. The inhibition of CYP2D6 translated into approximately a \n90% reduction in metabolite exposure and an approximate 37% increase in dacomitinib exposure. \n \nOther information on drug-drug interactions  \n \nEffect of dacomitinib and O-desmethyl dacomitinib on CYP enzymes  \nIn vitro, dacomitinib and its metabolite O-desmethyl dacomitinib have a low potential to inhibit the \nactivities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations. In vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at \nclinically relevant concentrations. \n \nEffect of dacomitinib on drug transporters  \nIn vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-gp \n(systemically), organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3, OCT2, organic anion transporting \npolypeptide (OATP)1B1, and OATP1B3, but may inhibit the activity of P-gp (in the GI tract), BCRP \n(systemically and GI tract), and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nEffect of Dacomitinib on UGT Enzymes  \nIn vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to inhibit uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT)1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nElimination  \n \nThe plasma half-life of dacomitinib ranges from 54 to 80 hours. Dacomitinib showed a clearance of \n20.0 L/hr with an inter-individual variability of 32% (CV%). In 6 healthy male subjects given a \nsingle-oral dose of [14C] radiolabeled dacomitinib, a median of 82% of the total administered \nradioactivity was recovered in 552 hours; faeces (79% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with \n3% of the dose recovered in urine, of which < 1% of the administered dose was unchanged \ndacomitinib.  \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nAge, race, gender, body weight \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, patient age, race (Asian and non-Asian), gender, and \nbody weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on predicted steady-state exposure of dacomitinib. \nApproximately 90% of patients included in this analysis were Asian or White. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nIn a dedicated hepatic impairment trial, following a single-oral dose of 30 mg Vizimpro, dacomitinib \nexposure (AUCinf and Cmax) was unchanged in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A; N=8) and \ndecreased by 15% and 20%, respectively in moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; N=9) when \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=8). Dacomitinib pharmacokinetics has not been \nstudied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). In addition, based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis using data from 1381 patients, that included 158 patients with \nmild hepatic impairment defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria [total bilirubin \u2264 Upper \nLimit of Normal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to \n1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any AST; N=158], mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \ndacomitinib. From the small number of patients in the moderate group [total bilirubin > 1.5 to \n3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST; N=5], there is no evidence for a change in dacomitinib pharmacokinetics. \n \nRenal impairment  \nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients with impaired renal function. Based on population \npharmacokinetic analyses, mild (60 mL/min \u2264 CrCl < 90 mL/min; N=590) and moderate \n(30 mL/min \u2264 CrCl < 60 mL/min; N=218) renal impairment, did not alter dacomitinib \npharmacokinetics, relative to subjects with normal (CrCl \u2265 90 mL/min; N=567) renal function. \nLimited pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with severe renal impairment \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min) (N=4). The pharmacokinetics in patients requiring haemodialysis have not been \nstudied.  \n \nExposure response relationships \nNo clear relationship between dacomitinib exposure and efficacy could be characterised over the \nexposure range studied. Significant exposure-safety relationship was defined for Grade \u2265 3 \nrash/dermatitis acneiform, other skin toxicities, diarrhoea and Grade \u2265 1 stomatitis.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity \n \nIn oral repeated-dose toxicity studies for up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs, the primary \ntoxicities were identified in the skin/hair (dermal changes in rats and dogs, atrophy/dysplasia of hair \nfollicles in rats), kidney (papillary necrosis often accompanied by tubular degeneration, regeneration, \ndilatation and/or atrophy and changes in urinary markers indicative of renal injury in rats, erosion or \nulceration of the pelvic epithelium with associated inflammation without changes indicative of renal \ndysfunction in dogs), eye (cornea epithelial atrophy in rats and dogs, corneal ulcers/erosions with \nred/swollen conjunctiva(e), conjunctivitis, elevated third eyelid, increased squinting, partially closed \neyes, lacrimation, and/or ocular discharge in dogs), and digestive system (enteropathy in rats and dogs, \nerosions/ulcers of the mouth with reddened mucous membranes in dogs), and atrophy of epithelial \ncells of other organs in rats. In addition, hepatocellular necrosis with transaminase increases and \n\n\n\n16 \n\nhepatocellular vacuolation were observed in rats only. These effects were reversible with the exception \nof hair follicles and kidney changes. All effects occurred at systemic exposure below that in humans at \nthe recommended dose of 45 mg once daily. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nDacomitinib was tested using a series of genetic toxicology assays. Dacomitinib was not mutagenic in \na bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, and not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo bone \nmarrow micronucleus assay in male and female rats. Dacomitinib was clastogenic in the in vitro \nhuman lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay at cytotoxic concentrations. Dacomitinib is not \ndirectly reactive toward DNA as evidenced by the negative response in the bacterial reverse mutation \nassay and did not induce chromosome damage in a bone marrow micronucleus assay at concentrations \nup to approximately 60-70 times the unbound AUC or Cmax at the recommended human dose. Thus, \ndacomitinib is not expected to be genotoxic at clinically relevant exposure concentrations. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. \n \nImpairment of fertility \n \nFertility studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies with \ndacomitinib, effects on reproductive organs were observed in female rats given approximately \n0.3 times the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose (for 6 months) and were limited to \nreversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina. There was no effect on reproductive organs in \nmale rats given \u2264 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months (approximately 1.1 times the unbound AUC at the \nrecommended human dose), or in dogs given \u2264 1 mg/kg/day for 9 months (approximately 0.3 times the \nunbound AUC at the recommended human dose). \n \nDevelopmental toxicity \n \nIn embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses up to \napproximately 2.4 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the unbound AUC at the recommended human \ndose during the period of organogenesis. Maternal body weight gain and food intake were lower in \npregnant rats and rabbits. The maternally toxic dose was foetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced foetal \nbody weights and higher incidence of unossified metatarsals.   \n \nPhototoxicity \n \nA phototoxicity study with dacomitinib in pigmented rats showed no phototoxicity potential. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that dacomitinib has the potential to be very \npersistent, bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.

What Vizimpro is and what it is used for \n \nVizimpro contains the active substance dacomitinib, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nprotein tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer.  \n \nVizimpro is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called \u2018non-small cell lung cancer\u2019. If a test \nhas shown that your cancer has certain changes (mutations) in a gene called \u2018EGFR\u2019 (epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor) and has spread to your other lung or other organs, your cancer is likely to \nrespond to treatment with Vizimpro. \n \nVizimpro can be used as your first treatment once your lung cancer has spread to your other lung or \nother organs. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vizimpro \n \nDo not take Vizimpro: \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to dacomitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vizimpro: \n\n\uf0b7 if you ever had any other lung problems.
