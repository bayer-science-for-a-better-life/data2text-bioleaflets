QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nPraluent 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \nEach single-use pre-filled pen contains 75 mg alirocumab in 1 ml solution. \n \nPraluent 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \nEach single-use pre-filled syringe contains 75 mg alirocumab in 1 ml solution. \n \nPraluent 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \nEach single-use pre-filled pen contains 150 mg alirocumab in 1 ml solution. \n \nPraluent 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \nEach single-use pre-filled syringe contains 150 mg alirocumab in 1 ml solution. \n \nAlirocumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells by \nrecombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection)  \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nPrimary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  \n \nPraluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) \nor mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: \n\n- in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach \nLDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, \n\n- alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or \nfor whom a statin is contraindicated. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nEstablished atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  \n \nPraluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce \ncardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:  \n\n- in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering \ntherapies or, \n\n- alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or \nfor whom a statin is contraindicated. \n\n \nFor study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations studied see section \n5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nPosology \n \nPrior to initiating alirocumab secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia (e.g., nephrotic \nsyndrome, hypothyroidism) should be excluded. \n \nThe usual starting dose for alirocumab is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. Patients \nrequiring larger LDL-C reduction (>60%) may be started on 150 mg once every 2 weeks, or 300 mg once \nevery 4 weeks (monthly), administered subcutaneously. \n \nThe dose of alirocumab can be individualised based on patient characteristics such as baseline LDL-C level, \ngoal of therapy, and response. Lipid levels can be assessed 4 to 8 weeks after treatment initiation or titration, \nand dose adjusted accordingly (up-titration or down-titration). If additional LDL-C reduction is needed in \npatients treated with 75 mg once every 2 weeks or 300 mg once every 4 weeks (monthly), the dosage may be \nadjusted to the maximum dosage of 150 mg once every 2 weeks.  \n \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should administer the injection as soon as possible and thereafter resume \ntreatment on the original schedule. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Limited data are \navailable in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nBody weight \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients based on weight.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Praluent in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nAlirocumab is injected as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \n \nEach pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe is for single use only. \n \nTo administer the 300 mg dose, two 150 mg injections should be given consecutively at two different \ninjection sites. \n \nIt is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. \n \nAlirocumab should not be injected into areas of active skin disease or injury such as sunburns, skin rashes, \ninflammation, or skin infections. \n \nAlirocumab must not be co-administered with other injectable medicinal products at the same injection site.  \n \nThe patient may either self-inject alirocumab, or a caregiver may administer alirocumab, after guidance has \nbeen provided by a healthcare professional on proper subcutaneous injection technique. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nThe solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nGeneral allergic reactions, including pruritus, as well as rare and sometimes serious allergic reactions such as \nhypersensitivity, nummular eczema, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis have been reported in clinical \nstudies. Angioedema has been reported in the postmarketing setting (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms \nof serious allergic reactions occur, treatment with alirocumab must be discontinued and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn clinical studies, there was limited representation of patients with severe renal impairment (defined as \neGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 5.2). alirocumab should be used with caution in patients with severe \nrenal impairment. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied (see section 5.2). Alirocumab \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nEffects of alirocumab on other medicinal products   \n \nSince alirocumab is a biological medicinal product, no pharmacokinetic effects of alirocumab on other \nmedicinal products and no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes are anticipated.  \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on alirocumab \n \nStatins and other lipid-modifying therapy are known to increase production of PCSK9, the protein targeted \nby alirocumab. This leads to the increased target-mediated clearance and reduced systemic exposure of \nalirocumab. Compared to alirocumab monotherapy, the exposure to alirocumab is about 40%, 15%, and 35% \nlower when used concomitantly with statins, ezetimibe, and fenofibrate, respectively. However, reduction of \nLDL-C is maintained during the dosing interval when alirocumab is administered every two weeks. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Praluent in pregnant women. Alirocumab is a recombinant IgG1 antibody, \ntherefore it is expected to cross the placental barrier (see section 5.3).  \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maintenance of pregnancy or \nembryo-fetal development; maternal toxicity was noted in rats, but not in monkeys at doses in excess of the \nhuman dose, and a weaker secondary immune response to antigen challenge was observed in the offspring of \nmonkeys (see section 5.3).  \nThe use of Praluent is not recommended during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \nrequires treatment with alirocumab. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether alirocumab is excreted in human milk. Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is excreted \nin human milk, in particular in colostrum; the use of Praluent is not recommended in breast-feeding women \nduring this period. For the remaining duration of breast-feeding, exposure is expected to be low.  \nSince the effects of alirocumab on the breast-fed infant are unknown, a decision should be made whether to \ndiscontinue nursing or to discontinue Praluent during this period. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal studies, there were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (see section 5.3). There are \nno data on adverse effects on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nPraluent has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions, at recommended doses, are local injection site reactions (6.1%), upper \nrespiratory tract signs and symptoms (2.0%), and pruritus (1.1%). Most common adverse reactions leading to \ntreatment discontinuation in patients treated with alirocumab were local injection site reactions.  \nThe safety profile in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES was consistent with the overall safety profile described in the \nphase 3 controlled trials. \n \nNo difference in the safety profile was observed between the two doses (75 mg and 150 mg) used in the \nphase 3 program. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with alirocumab in pooled controlled \nstudies and/or post-marketing use (see Table 1). \n \nFrequencies for all adverse reactions identified from clinical trials have been calculated based on their \nincidence in pooled phase 3 clinical trials. Adverse reactions are presented by system organ class. Frequency \ncategories are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they are \nderived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse reactions is qualified as \"not \nknown\". \n \nTable 1 – Adverse reactions  \n\nSystem organ class Common Rare Not known \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity, \nhypersensitivity vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUpper respiratory \ntract signs and \nsymptoms* \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus Urticaria, \neczema nummular \n\nAngioedema \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site \nreactions** \n\n Flu-like illness \n\n*   including mainly oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing \n** including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain/tenderness \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLocal injection site reactions  \n \nLocal injection site reactions, including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness, were \nreported in 6.1% of patients treated with alirocumab versus 4.1% in the control group (receiving placebo \ninjections). Most injection site reactions were transient and of mild intensity. The discontinuation rate due to \nlocal injection site reactions was comparable between the two groups (0.2% in the alirocumab group versus \n0.3% in the control group). In the cardiovascular outcomes study (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES), injection site \n\n\n\n7 \n\nreactions also occurred more frequently in alirocumab-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (3.8% \nalirocumab versus 2.1% placebo). \n \nGeneral allergic reactions  \n \nGeneral allergic reactions were reported more frequently in the alirocumab group (8.1% of patients) than in \nthe control group (7.0% of patients), mainly due to a difference in the incidence of pruritus. The observed \ncases of pruritus were typically mild and transient. In addition, rare and sometimes serious allergic reactions \nsuch as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis have been reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies (see section 4.4). In the cardiovascular outcomes study (ODYSSEY \nOUTCOMES), general allergic reactions were similar in alirocumab-treated patients and placebo-treated \npatients (7.9% alirocumab, 7.8% placebo). No difference was seen in the incidence of pruritus. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nAlthough no safety issues were observed in patients over 75 years of age, data are limited in this age group. \nIn the phase 3 primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidaemia controlled studies, 1,158 patients \n(34.7%) treated with alirocumab were ≥65 years of age and 241 patients (7.2%) treated with alirocumab were \n≥75 years of age. In the cardiovascular outcomes controlled study, 2,505 patients (26.5%) treated with \nalirocumab were ≥65 years of age and 493 patients (5.2%) treated with alirocumab were ≥75 years of age. \nThere were no significant differences observed in safety and efficacy with increasing age. \n \nEvery 4 week dosing study  \n \nThe safety profile in patients treated with a 300 mg once every 4 week (monthly) dosing regimen was similar \nto the safety profile as described for the clinical studies program using a 2 week dosing regimen, except for a \nhigher rate of local injection site reactions. Local injection site reactions were reported overall at a frequency \nof 16.6% in the 300 mg once every 4 weeks treatment group and 7.9% in the placebo group. Patients in the \nalirocumab 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment group received alternating placebo injections to maintain \nblinding in regard to injection frequency. Excluding injection site reactions (ISRs) that occurred after these \nplacebo injections, the frequency of ISRs was 11.8%. The discontinuation rate due to injection site reactions \nwas 0.7% in the 300 mg once every 4 weeks treatment group and 0% in the placebo group. \n \nLDL-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L) \n \nIn all clinical studies background lipid lowering therapies could not be adjusted by trial design. The \npercentage of patients who reached LDL-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L) depended both on the \nbaseline LDL-C and the dose of alirocumab. \n \nIn a pool of controlled studies using a 75 mg every 2 week (Q2W) starting dose and in which the dose was \nincreased to 150 mg Q2W if the patient’s LDL-C was not <70 mg/dL or < 100 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L or 2.59 \nmmol/L), 29.3% of patients with baseline LDL-C <100 mg/dL and 5.0% of patients with baseline LDL-C \n≥100 mg/dL treated with alirocumab had two consecutive values of LDL-C <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L). In \nthe ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, in which the starting alirocumab dose was 75 mg Q2W and the dose \nwas increased to 150 mg Q2W if the patient’s LDL-C was not <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L), 54.8% of patients \nwith baseline LDL-C <100 mg/dL and 24.2% of patients with baseline LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL treated with \nalirocumab had two consecutive values of LDL-C <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L). \n \nAlthough adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in alirocumab trials, the long-term \neffects of very low levels of LDL-C are unknown. In published genetic studies as well as clinical and \nobservational trials with lipid lowering therapies an increased risk of new onset of diabetes has been \nassociated with lower levels of LDL-C. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nImmunogenicity/ Anti-drug-antibodies (ADA)  \n \nIn the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, 5.5% of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg and/or 150 mg every \n2 weeks (Q2W) had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) detected after initiating treatment compared with 1.6% of \npatients treated with placebo, most of these were transient responses. Persistent ADA responses were \nobserved in 0.7% of patients treated with alirocumab and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Neutralising \nantibody (NAb) responses were observed in 0.5% of patients treated with alirocumab and in <0.1% of \npatients treated with placebo.  \n \nAnti-drug antibody responses, including NAb, were low titer and did not appear to have a clinically \nmeaningful impact on the efficacy or safety of alirocumab, except for a higher rate of injection site reactions \nin patients with treatment emergent ADA compared to patients who were ADA negative (7.5% vs 3.6%). \nThe long-term consequences of continuing alirocumab treatment in the presence of ADA are unknown. \nIn a pool of ten placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg \nand/or 150 mg Q2W as well as in a separate clinical study of patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or \n300 mg every 4 weeks (including some patients with dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W), the incidence of \ndetecting ADA and NAb was similar to the results from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial described above. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nThere is no specific treatment for  alirocumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be \ntreated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: C10AX14. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAlirocumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to \nproprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors \n(LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary \nreceptor that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood \nlevels of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs \navailable to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.  \n \nThe LDLR also binds triglyceride-rich VLDL remnant lipoproteins and intermediate-density lipoprotein \n(IDL). Therefore, alirocumab treatment can produce reductions in these remnant lipoproteins as evidenced \nby its reductions in apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and \ntriglycerides (TG). Alirocumab also results in reductions in lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], which is a form of LDL \nthat is bound to apolipoprotein (a). However, the LDLR has been shown to have a low affinity for Lp(a), \ntherefore the exact mechanism by which alirocumab lowers Lp(a) is not fully understood. \n \nIn genetic studies in humans, PCSK9 variants with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations have \nbeen identified. Individuals with single allele PCSK9 loss-of-function mutation have lower levels of LDL-C, \nwhich correlated with a significantly lower incidence of coronary heart disease. A few individuals have been \nreported, who carry PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations in two alleles and have profoundly low LDL-C \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nlevels, with HDL-C and TG levels in the normal range. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in the \nPCSK9 gene have been identified in patients with increased LDL-C levels and a clinical diagnosis of familial \nhypercholesterolaemia. \n \nIn a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14 week study, 13 patients with heterozygous familial \nhypercholesterolaemia (heFH) due to gain-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene were randomised to \nreceive either alirocumab 150 mg Q2W or placebo. Mean baseline LDL-C was 151.5 mg/dL (3.90 mmol/L). \nAt week 2, the mean reduction from baseline in LDL-C was 62.5% in the alirocumab-treated patients as \ncompared to 8.8% in the placebo patients. At week 8, the mean reduction in LDL-C from baseline with all \npatients treated with alirocumab was 72.4%.  \n  \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn in vitro assays, alirocumab did not induce Fc-mediated effector function activity (antibody-dependent \ncell-mediated toxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity) either in the presence or absence of PCSK9 \nand no soluble immune complexes capable of binding complement proteins were observed for alirocumab \nwhen bound to PCSK9.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia \n \nSummary of the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program - 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing \nregimen \n \nThe efficacy of alirocumab was investigated in ten phase 3 trials (five placebo-controlled and five \nezetimibe-controlled studies), involving 5,296 randomised patients with hypercholesterolaemia \n(heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, with 3,188 patients randomised to \nalirocumab. In the phase 3 studies, 31% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 64% of patients had a \nhistory of coronary heart disease. Three of the ten studies were conducted exclusively in patients with \nheterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (heFH). The majority of patients in the phase 3 program were \ntaking background lipid-modifying therapy consisting of a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or \nwithout other lipid-modifying therapies, and were at high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Two studies \nwere conducted in patients who were not concomitantly treated with a statin, including one study in patients \nwith documented statin intolerance.  \n \nTwo studies (LONG TERM and HIGH FH), involving a total of 2,416 patients, were performed with a \n150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) dose only. Eight studies were performed with a dose of 75 mg Q2W, and \ncriteria-based up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 in patients who did not achieve their pre-defined target \nLDL-C based on their level of CV risk at week 8.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in all of the phase 3 studies was the mean percent reduction from baseline in \nLDL-C at week 24 as compared to placebo or ezetimibe. All of the studies met their primary endpoint. In \ngeneral, administration of alirocumab also resulted in a statistically significant greater percent reduction in \ntotal cholesterol (Total-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo \nB), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] as compared to placebo/ ezetimibe, whether or not patients were \nconcomitantly being treated with a statin. Alirocumab also reduced triglycerides (TG), and increased \nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) as compared to placebo. \nFor detailed results see Table 2 below. Reduction in LDL-C was seen across age, gender, body mass index \n(BMI), race, baseline LDL-C levels, patients with heFH and non-heFH, patients with mixed dyslipidaemia, \nand diabetic patients. Although similar efficacy was observed in patients over 75 years, data are limited in \nthis age group. LDL-C reduction was consistent regardless of concomitantly used statins and doses. A \nsignificantly higher proportion of patients achieved an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) in the \nalirocumab group as compared to placebo or ezetimibe at week 12 and week 24. In studies using the criteria-\nbased up-titration regimen, a majority of patients achieved the pre-defined target LDL-C (based on their \nlevel of CV risk) on the 75 mg Q2W dose, and a majority of patients maintained treatment on the 75 mg \nQ2W dose. The lipid-lowering effect of alirocumab was observed within 15 days after the first dose reaching \nmaximum effect at approximately 4 weeks. With long-term treatment, efficacy was sustained over the \n\n\n\n10 \n\nduration of the studies (up to 2 years). Following discontinuation of alirocumab, no rebound in LDL-C was \nobserved, and LDL-C levels gradually returned to baseline levels.  \n \nIn pre-specified analyses before possible up-titration at week 12 in the 8 studies in which patients started \nwith the 75 mg every 2 weeks dosing regimen, mean reductions in LDL-C ranging from 44.5% to 49.2% \nwere achieved. In the 2 studies in which patients were started and maintained on 150 mg every 2 weeks, the \nachieved mean reduction of LDL-C at week 12 was 62.6%. In analyses of pooled phase 3 studies that \nallowed up-titration, among the subgroup of patients up-titrated, an increase from 75 mg Q2W to 150 mg \nQ2W alirocumab at week 12 resulted in an additional 14% mean reduction in LDL-C in patients on a \nbackground statin. In patients not on a background statin, up-titration of alirocumab resulted in an additional \n3% mean reduction in LDL-C, with the majority of the effect seen in approximately 25% of patients who \nachieved at least an additional 10% LDL-C lowering after up-titration. Patients up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W \nhad a higher mean baseline LDL-C. \n \nEvaluation of cardiovascular (CV) events  \n \nIn pre-specified analyses of pooled phase 3 studies, treatment-emergent CV events confirmed by \nadjudication, consisting of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, \nunstable angina requiring hospitalisation, congestive heart failure hospitalisation, and revascularisation, were \nreported in 110 (3.5%) patients in the alirocumab group and 53 (3.0%) patients in the control group (placebo \nor active control) with HR=1.08 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.50).  Major adverse cardiovascular events (“MACE-\nplus”, i.e.: CHD death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation) \nconfirmed by adjudication were reported in 52 of 3,182 (1.6%) patients in the alirocumab group and 33 of \n1,792 (1.8%) patients in the control group (placebo or active control); HR=0.81 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.25). \n \nIn pre-specified final analyses of the LONG TERM study, treatment-emergent CV events confirmed by \nadjudication occurred in 72 of 1,550 (4.6%) patients in the alirocumab group and in 40 of 788 (5.1%) \npatients in the placebo group; MACE-plus confirmed by adjudication were reported in 27 of 1,550 (1.7%) \npatients in the alirocumab group and 26 of 788 (3.3%) patients in the placebo group. Hazard ratios were \ncalculated post-hoc; for all CV events, HR=0.91 (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.34); for MACE-plus, HR=0.52 (95% CI, \n0.31 to 0.90). \n \nAll-cause mortality \n \nAll-cause mortality in phase 3 studies was 0.6% (20 of 3,182 patients) in the alirocumab group and 0.9% (17 \nof 1,792 patients) in the control group. The primary cause of death in the majority of these patients was CV \nevents. \n\nCombination therapy with a statin \n \nPlacebo-controlled phase 3 studies (on background statin) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia \nor mixed dyslipidaemia \n \nLONG TERM study  \n \nThis multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study included 2,310 patients with primary \nhypercholesterolaemia at high or very high CV risk and on a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or \nwithout other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients received either alirocumab at a dose of 150 mg Q2W or \nplacebo in addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. The LONG TERM study included 17.7% heFH \npatients, 34.6% with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 68.6% with a history of coronary heart disease.  At week \n24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -61.9% (95% \nCI: -64.3%, -59.4%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 2. At week 12, 82.1% of patients in the \nalirocumab group reached an LDL-C ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) compared to 7.2% of patients in the \nplacebo group. Difference versus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/lipoproteins. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nCOMBO I study \n \nA multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52 week study included 311 patients categorised as very \nhigh CV risk and not at their pre-defined target LDL-C on a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or \nwithout other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients received either 75 mg alirocumab Q2W or placebo in \naddition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred \nat week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference \nfrom placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -45.9% (95% CI: -52.5%, -39.3%; p-value: \n˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 4. At week 12 (before up-titration), 76.0% of patients in the \nalirocumab group reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂ 1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 11.3% in the placebo \ngroup. The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 32 (16.8%) patients treated beyond 12 weeks. Among the \nsubgroup of patients up-titrated at week 12, an additional 22.8% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at \nweek 24. The difference versus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins \nexcept TG and Apo A-1. \n \nPlacebo-controlled phase 3 studies (on background statin) in patients with heterozygous familial \nhypercholesterolaemia (heFH) \n \nFH I and FH II studies  \n \nTwo multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 18-month studies included 732 patients with heFH \nreceiving a maximally tolerated dose of statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapy. Patients \nreceived either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or placebo in addition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. Dose \nup-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C \n≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in LDL-C percent \nchange from baseline was -55.8% (95% CI: -60.0%, -51.6%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). For detailed results see \nTable 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 50.2% of patients reached an LDL-C of \n˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0.6% in the placebo group. Among the subgroup of patients \nup-titrated at week 12, an additional 15.7% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. Difference \nversus placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins. \n \nHIGH FH study \n \nA third multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-month study included 106 heFH patients on a \nmaximally tolerated dose of statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapies, and a baseline LDL-C \n≥160 mg/dL (≥4.14 mmol/L). Patients received either alirocumab at a dose of 150 mg Q2W or placebo in \naddition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy. At week 24, the mean treatment difference from placebo in \nLDL-C percent change from baseline was -39.1% (95% CI: -51.1%, -27.1%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed \nresults see Table 2. Mean changes for all other lipids/ lipoproteins were similar to the FH I and FH II studies, \nhowever statistical significance was not reached for TG, HDL-C and Apo A-1.  \n \nEzetimibe-controlled phase 3 study (on background statin) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia \nor mixed dyslipidaemia  \n \nCOMBO II study  \n \nA multicenter, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled 2 year study included 707 patients categorised as very high \nCV risk and not at their pre-defined target LDL-C on a maximally tolerated dose of statin. Patients received \neither alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or ezetimibe 10 mg once daily in addition to their existing statin therapy. \nDose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C \n≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from ezetimibe in LDL-C percent \nchange from baseline was -29.8% (95% CI: -34.4%, -25.3%; p-value: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see \nTable 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 77.2% of patients reached an LDL-C of \n˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 46.2% in the ezetimibe group. Among the subgroup of patients \nup-titrated at week 12, an additional 10.5% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. Difference \nversus ezetimibe was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipids/ lipoproteins except for TG, and Apo \nA-1. \n\n\n\n12 \n\nMonotherapy or as add-on to non-statin lipid-modifying therapy \n \nEzetimibe-controlled phase 3 trials in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (without a background \nstatin) \n \nALTERNATIVE study  \n \nA multicentre, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, 24 week study included 248 patients with documented \nstatin intolerance due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms. Patients received either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W \nor ezetimibe 10 mg once daily, or atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (as a re-challenge arm). Dose up-titration of \nalirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L) or \n≥100 mg/dL (≥2.59 mmol/L), depending on their level of CV risk. At week 24, the mean treatment \ndifference from ezetimibe in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -30.4% (95% CI: -36.6%, -24.2%; p-\nvalue: ˂0.0001). For detailed results see Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 34.9% of patients reached \nan LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0% in the ezetimibe group. Among the subgroup of \npatients up-titrated at week 12, an additional 3.6% mean reduction in LDL-C was achieved at week 24. \nDifference versus ezetimibe was statistically significant at week 24 for LDL-C, Total-C, Non-HDL-C, Apo \nB, and Lp(a). \n \nThis trial evaluated patients who did not tolerate at least two statins (at least one at the lowest approved dose), \nIn these patients, musculo-skeletal adverse events occurred at a lower rate in the alirocumab group (32.5%) \nas compared to the atorvastatin group (46.0%) (HR= 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99]), and a lower percentage of \npatients in the alirocumab group (15.9%) discontinued study treatment due to musculo-skeletal adverse \nevents as compared to the atorvastatin group (22.2%). In the five placebo-controlled trials in patients on a \nmaximally tolerated dose of statin (n=3752), the discontinuation rate due to musculo-skeletal adverse events \nwas 0.4% in the alirocumab group and 0.5% in the placebo group.  \n \nMONO study  \n \nA multicenter, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, 24-week study included 103 patients with a moderate CV \nrisk, not taking statins or other lipid-modifying therapies, and a baseline LDL-C between \n100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) to 190 mg/dL (4.91 mmol/L). Patients received either alirocumab 75 mg Q2W or \nezetimibe 10 mg once daily. Dose up-titration of alirocumab to 150 mg Q2W occurred at week 12 in patients \nwith LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L). At week 24, the mean treatment difference from ezetimibe in \nLDL-C percent change from baseline was -31.6% (95% CI: -40.2%, -23.0%; p-value: ˂0.0001).  For detailed \nresults see Table 2. At week 12 (before up-titration), 57.7% of patients reached an LDL-C of \n˂70 mg/dL (˂1.81 mmol/L) as compared to 0% in the ezetimibe group.

Patients received either alirocumab 300 mg Q4W, alirocumab 75 mg Q2W, or placebo in \naddition to their existing lipid-modifying therapy (statin, non-statin therapy or diet alone). Patients in the \nalirocumab 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment group received alternating placebo injections to maintain \nblinding in regard to injection frequency. Overall, 71.6% of patients were categorized at high or very high \nCV risk and not at their LDL-C target. Dose adjustment in the alirocumab groups to 150 mg Q2W occurred \nat week 12 in patients with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or ≥100 mg/dL, depending on their level of CV risk, or in \npatients who did not have at least a 30% reduction of LDL-C from baseline. \n \nIn the cohort of patients on background statin, the mean baseline LDL-C was 112.7 mg/dL. At week 12, the \nmean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W in LDL-C (ITT analysis) was -55.3% \ncompared to +1.1% for placebo. At week 12 (before dose adjustment), 77.3% of patients treated with \nalirocumab 300 mg Q4W reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL as compared to 9.3% in the placebo group. At \nweek 24, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W in LDL-C \n(ITT analysis) was -58.8% compared to -0.1% for placebo. At week 24, the mean treatment difference for \nalirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -58.7% \n(97.5% CI: -65.0%, -52.4%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). In patients treated beyond 12 weeks, the dose was adjusted \nto 150 mg Q2W in 56 (19.3%) of 290 patients in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W arm. Among the subgroup of \npatients dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W at week 12, an additional 25.4% reduction in LDL-C was achieved at \nweek 24. \n \nIn the cohort of patients not treated with a concomitant statin, the mean baseline LDL-C was 142.1 mg/dL. \nAt week 12, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W in LDL-C (ITT analysis) \nwas -58.4% compared to +0.3% for placebo. At week 12 (before dose adjustment), 65.2% of patients treated \nwith alirocumab 300 mg Q4W reached an LDL-C of ˂70 mg/dL as compared to 2.8% in the placebo group. \nAt week 24, the mean percent change from baseline with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W in LDL-C \n(ITT analysis) was -52.7% compared to -0.3% for placebo. At week 24, the mean treatment difference for \nalirocumab 300 mg Q4W/150 mg Q2W from placebo in LDL-C percent change from baseline was -52.4% \n(97.5% CI: -59.8%, -45.0%; p-value: ˂ 0.0001). In patients treated beyond 12 weeks, the dose was adjusted \nto 150 mg Q2W in 19 (14.7%) of 129 patients in the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W arm. Among the subgroup of \npatients dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W at week 12, an additional 7.3% mean reduction in LDL-C was \nachieved at week 24. \n \nIn both cohorts, the difference vs placebo was statistically significant at week 24 for all lipid parameters, \nexcept for Apo A-1 in the subgroup of patients on background statin. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety in prevention of cardiovascular events   \n \nODYSSEY OUTCOMES study  \n \nA multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 18,924 adult patients (9,462 alirocumab; 9,462 \nplacebo) followed for up to 5 years. Patients had experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event 4 to \n52 weeks prior to randomization and were treated with a lipid-modifying-therapy (LMT) regimen that was \nstatin-intensive (defined as atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg) or at maximally tolerated \ndose of those statins, with or without other LMT. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either alirocumab \n75 mg once every two weeks (Q2W) or placebo Q2W. At month 2, if additional LDL-C lowering was \nrequired based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria (LDL-C ≥50 mg/dL or 1.29 mmol/L), alirocumab was \nadjusted to 150 mg Q2W. For patients who had their dose adjusted to 150 mg Q2W and who had two \nconsecutive LDL-C values below 25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), down-titration from 150 mg Q2W to 75 mg \nQ2W was performed. Patients on 75 mg Q2W who had two consecutive LDL-C values below 15 mg/dL \n(0.39 mmol/L) were switched to placebo in a blinded fashion. Approximately 2,615 (27.7%) of 9,451 \npatients treated with alirocumab required dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W. Of these 2615 patients, 805 \n(30.8%) were down-titrated to 75 mg Q2W. Overall, 730 (7.7%) of 9,451 patients switched to placebo. A \ntotal of 99.5% of patients were followed for survival until the end of the trial. The median follow-up duration \nwas 33 months. \n\nThe index ACS event was a myocardial infarction in 83.2% of patients (34.6% STEMI, 48.6% NSTEMI) \nand an episode of unstable angina in 16.8% of patients. Most patients (88.8%) were receiving high intensity \nstatin therapy with or without other LMT at randomization. The mean LDL-C value at baseline was 92.4 \nmg/dL (2.39 mmol/L). \n\nAlirocumab significantly reduced the risk for the primary composite endpoint of the time to first occurrence \nof Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE-plus) consisting of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina (UA) requiring \nhospitalization (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.93; p-value=0.0003). Alirocumab also significantly reduced the \nfollowing composite endpoints: risk of CHD event; major CHD event; cardiovascular event; and the \ncomposite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. A reduction of all-cause \nmortality was also observed, with only nominal statistical significance by hierarchical testing (HR 0.85, 95% \nCI: 0.73, 0.98).

The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single subcutaneous \nadministration of 75 mg into the abdomen, upper arm or thigh were similar. The absolute bioavailability of \nalirocumab after subcutaneous administration was about 85% as determined by population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis. Monthly exposure with 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment was similar to that of 150 mg every \n2 weeks. The fluctuations between Cmax and Ctrough were higher for the every 4 weeks dosage regimen. Steady \nstate was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio up to a maximum of about 2-fold.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution was about 0.04 to 0.05 L/kg indicating that \nalirocumab is distributed primarily in the circulatory system.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSpecific metabolism studies were not conducted, because alirocumab is a protein. Alirocumab is expected to \ndegrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \n \nTwo elimination phases were observed for alirocumab. At low concentrations, the elimination is \npredominately through saturable binding to target (PCSK9), while at higher concentrations the elimination of \nalirocumab is largely through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway.  \n \n\nHazard Ratio: 0.85 \n95% CI (0.78, 0.93) \n\nPlacebo \n\nAlirocumab \n\nCu\n\nmu\n\nlati\n\nve \n\ninci\n\nden\n\nce \n\n \n\n Time (months) \n\n\n\n18 \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median apparent half-life of alirocumab at steady state \nwas 17 to 20 days in patients receiving alirocumab as monotherapy at subcutaneous doses of either 75 mg \nQ2W or 150 mg Q2W. When co-administered with a statin, the median apparent half-life of alirocumab was \n12 days.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nA slightly greater than dose proportional increase was observed, with a 2.1- to 2.7-fold increase in total \nalirocumab concentrations for a 2-fold increase in dose from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was associated with a small difference in alirocumab \nexposure at steady state, with no impact on efficacy or safety. \n \nGender \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender has no impact on alirocumab pharmacokinetics. \n \nRace \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, race had no impact on alirocumab pharmacokinetics. \nFollowing single-dose subcutaneous administration of 100 mg to 300 mg alirocumab, there was no \nmeaningful difference in exposure between Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects. \n \nBody weight \n \nBody weight was identified as one significant covariate in the final population PK model impacting \nalirocumab pharmacokinetics. Alirocumab exposure (AUC0-14d) at steady state at both the 75 and 150 mg \nQ2W dosing regimen was decreased by 29% and 36% in patients weighing more than 100 kg as compared to \npatients weighing between 50 kg and 100 kg. This did not translate into a clinically meaningful difference in \nLDL-C lowering. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn a phase 1 study, after administration of a single 75 mg subcutaneous dose, alirocumab pharmacokinetic \nprofiles in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar as compared to subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nSince monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways, renal function is not \nexpected to impact the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that \nalirocumab exposure (AUC0-14d) at steady state at both the 75 and 150 mg Q2W dosing regimen was \nincreased by 22%-35%, and 49%-50% in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, respectively, \ncompared to patients with normal renal function. The distribution of body weight and age, two covariates \nimpacting alirocumab exposure, were different among renal function categories and most likely explain the \nobserved pharmacokinetic differences. Limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment; in \nthese patients the exposure to alirocumab was approximately 2-fold higher compared with subjects with \nnormal renal function. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nThe pharmacodynamic effect of alirocumab in lowering LDL-C is indirect, and mediated through the binding \nto PCSK9. A concentration-dependent reduction in free PCSK9 and LDL-C is observed until target \nsaturation is achieved. Upon saturation of PCSK9 binding, further increases in alirocumab concentrations do \nnot result in a further LDL-C reduction, however an extended duration of the LDL-C lowering effect is \nobserved. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology \nand repeated dose toxicity. \n \nReproductive toxicology studies in rats and monkeys indicated that alirocumab, like other IgG antibodies, \ncrosses the placental barrier. \n \nThere were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (e.g. estrous cyclicity, testicular volume, \nejaculate volume, sperm motility, or total sperm count per ejaculate) in monkeys, and no alirocumab-related \nanatomic pathology or histopathology findings in reproductive tissues in any rat or monkey toxicology study. \n \nThere were no adverse effects on fetal growth or development in rats or monkeys. Maternal toxicity was not \nevident in pregnant monkeys at systemic exposures that were 81 times the human exposure at the 150 mg \nQ2W dose. However, maternal toxicity was noted in pregnant rats at systemic exposures estimated to be \napproximately 5.3 times greater than the human exposure at the 150 mg Q2W dose (based on exposure \nmeasured in non-pregnant rats during a 5-week toxicology study). \n \nThe offspring of monkeys that received high doses of alirocumab weekly throughout pregnancy had a \nweaker secondary immune response to antigen challenge than did the offspring of control animals. There was \nno other evidence of alirocumab-related immune dysfunction in the offspring.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user  \n\n \nPraluent 75 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled pen  \n\nPraluent 150 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled pen  \nalirocumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Praluent is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Praluent  \n3. How to use Praluent  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Praluent  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Praluent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Praluent is \n• Praluent contains the active substance alirocumab.  \n• Praluent is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein designed to attach to a target \n\nsubstance in the body). Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique \nproteins. Alirocumab binds to PCSK9. \n\n \nHow Praluent works \nPraluent helps lower your levels of “bad” cholesterol (also called “LDL cholesterol”). Praluent blocks a \nprotein called PCSK9. \n• PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. \n• “Bad” cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific “receptors” (docking \n\nstations) in your liver.  \n• PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver – this causes your “bad” cholesterol to be \n\nhigher than it should.  \n• By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the “bad” \n\ncholesterol – this lowers your “bad” cholesterol levels. \n \nWhat Praluent is used for \n• Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia [heterozygous familial and \n\nnon-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia).  \n• Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce \n\ncardiovascular risk.  \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nIt is given:  \n- together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol \nlowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently \nor, \n- alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot \nbe used. \n\nContinue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Praluent  \n \nDo not use Praluent  \n• if you are allergic to alirocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Praluent.  \n \nIf you develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Praluent, talk to your doctor right away. Sometimes \nserious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity, including angioedema (difficulties breathing, or swelling \nof the face, lips, throat or tongue), nummular eczema (reddish skin spots sometimes with blisters), and \nhypersensitivity vasculitis (which is a specific form of a hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms such as \ndiarrhoea, with a rash, or purple-coloured skin spots on the skin) have occurred. For allergic reactions that \nmay occur while taking Praluent, see section 4. \n \nTell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease before using this medicine, because Praluent has been \nstudied in few patients with severe kidney disease and not in patients with severe liver disease. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years old because there is no experience of \nusing the medicine in these age groups.  \n \nOther medicines and Praluent \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \nPraluent is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nThis medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to use Praluent \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to inject \nYour doctor will tell you which dose is right for you and how often to inject (75 mg or 150 mg once every 2 \nweeks, or 300 mg once every 4 weeks/monthly)). Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and may \nadjust the dose (up or down) during treatment.  \nAlways check the label of your pen to make sure you have the right medicine and the right strength. \n \nWhen to inject \nInject Praluent once every 2 weeks (for the 75 mg or 150 mg dose), or once every 4 weeks/monthly (for the \n300 mg dose). To give the 300 mg dose, give two 150 mg injections in a row at two different injection sites. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nBefore you inject \nPraluent should be allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use. \nRead the detailed instructions for use leaflet before you inject Praluent.  \n \nWhere to inject \nPraluent is injected under your skin into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \nRead the detailed instructions for use leaflet on where to inject. \n \nLearning how to use the pre-filled pen \nBefore you use the pen for the first time, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will show you how to inject \nPraluent.  \n\n• Always read the \"Instructions for Use\" provided in the box.  \n• Always use the pen as described in the “Instructions for Use”.  \n\n \nIf you use more Praluent than you should  \nIf you use more Praluent than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nIf you forget to use Praluent  \nIf you miss a dose of Praluent, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. Then take your next dose at your \nregular scheduled time. This will keep you on the original schedule. If you are not sure when to inject \nPraluent, call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you stop using Praluent  \nDo not stop using Praluent without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Praluent, your cholesterol \nlevels can increase. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Praluent, talk to your doctor right away. Sometimes \nserious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity (difficulties breathing), nummular eczema (reddish skin \nspots sometimes with blisters), and hypersensitivity vasculitis (which is a specific form of a hypersensitivity \nreaction with symptoms such as diarrhoea, with a rash, or purple-coloured skin spots on the skin) have \noccurred (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people).  \n \nOther side effects are: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• redness, itching, swelling, pain/tenderness where the medicine was injected (local injection site \n\nreactions) \n• upper respiratory tract signs or symptoms such as sore throat, running nose, sneezing \n• itching (pruritus). \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n• red and itchy raised bumps or hives (urticaria) \n \nNot Known \n \nThe following side effects have been reported since the marketing of Praluent, but how often they occur is \nnot known: \n• flu-like illness \n• difficulties breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, throat or tongue (angioedema)  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Praluent \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C).

What you need to know before you use Praluent  \n3. How to use Praluent  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Praluent  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Praluent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Praluent is \n• Praluent contains the active substance alirocumab.  \n• Praluent is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein designed to attach to a target \n\nsubstance in the body). Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique \nproteins. Alirocumab binds to PCSK9. \n\n \nHow Praluent works \nPraluent helps lower your levels of “bad” cholesterol (also called “LDL cholesterol”). Praluent blocks a \nprotein called PCSK9. \n• PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. \n• “Bad” cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific “receptors” (docking \n\nstations) in your liver.  \n• PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver – this causes your “bad” cholesterol to be \n\nhigher than it should.  \n• By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the “bad” \n\ncholesterol – this lowers your “bad” cholesterol levels. \n \nWhat Praluent is used for \n• Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia, heterozygous familial and \n\nnon-familial, or mixed dyslipidaemia).  \n• Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce \n\ncardiovascular risk.  \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nIt is given: \n - together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol \nlowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently \nor, \n- alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot \nbe used. \n\nContinue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Praluent  \n \nDo not use Praluent  \n• if you are allergic to alirocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Praluent. \n \nIf you develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Praluent, talk to your doctor right away. Sometimes \nserious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity, including angioedema (difficulties breathing, or swelling \nof the face, lips, throat or tongue), nummular eczema (reddish skin spots sometimes with blisters), and \nhypersensitivity vasculitis (which is a specific form of a hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms such as \ndiarrhoea, with a rash, or purple-coloured skin spots on the skin) have occurred. For allergic reactions that \nmay occur while taking Praluent, see section 4. \n \nTell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease before using this medicine, because Praluent has been \nstudied in few patients with severe kidney disease and not in patients with severe liver disease. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years old because there is no experience of \nusing the medicine in these age groups.  \n \nOther medicines and Praluent \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \nPraluent is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nThis medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to use Praluent \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you.

Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and may \nadjust the dose (up or down) during treatment.   \nAlways check the label of your syringe to make sure you have the right medicine and the right strength. \n \nWhen to inject \nInject Praluent once every 2 weeks (for the 75 mg or 150 mg dose), or once every 4 weeks/monthly (for the \n300 mg dose). To give the 300 mg dose, give two 150 mg injections in a row at two different injection sites. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nBefore you inject \nPraluent should be allowed to warm to room temperature prior to use. \nRead the detailed instructions for use leaflet before you inject Praluent.  \n \nWhere to inject \nPraluent is injected under your skin into the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \nRead the detailed instructions for use leaflet on where to inject. \n \nLearning how to use the pre-filled syringe \nBefore you use the syringe for the first time, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will show you how to inject \nPraluent.  \n\n• Always read the \"Instructions for Use\" provided in the box.  \n• Always use the syringe as described in the “Instructions for Use”.  \n\n \nIf you use more Praluent than you should  \nIf you use more Praluent than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nIf you forget to use Praluent  \nIf you miss a dose of Praluent, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. Then take your next dose at your \nregular scheduled time. This will keep you on the original schedule. If you are not sure when to inject \nPraluent, call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you stop using Praluent  \nDo not stop using Praluent without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Praluent, your cholesterol \nlevels can increase. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Praluent , talk to your doctor right away. Sometimes \nserious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity (difficulties breathing), nummular eczema (reddish skin \nspots sometimes with blisters), and hypersensitivity vasculitis (which is a specific form of a hypersensitivity \nreaction with symptoms such as diarrhoea, with a rash, or purple-coloured skin spots on the skin) have \noccurred (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people).  \n \nOther side effects are: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• redness, itching, swelling, pain/tenderness where the medicine was injected (local injection site \n\nreactions) \n• upper respiratory tract signs or symptoms such as sore throat, running nose,  sneezing \n• itching (pruritus). \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n• red and itchy raised bumps or hives (urticaria) \n \nNot Known \n \nThe following side effects have been reported since the marketing of Praluent, but how often they occur is \nnot known: \n \n• flu-like illness \n• difficulties breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, throat or tongue (angioedema)  \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
