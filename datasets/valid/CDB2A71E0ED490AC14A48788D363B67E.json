PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nImraldi in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n- the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \n\nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \n\nwith methotrexate. \n \nImraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nImraldi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Imraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of \nintolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than \n2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an \ninadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an \ninadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by \nX-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve \nphysical function. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who \nare candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nImraldi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients who \nhave not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nImraldi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine \n(6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid- \nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or \nin whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nImraldi treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Imraldi is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Imraldi (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nImraldi should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Imraldi if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Imraldi, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Imraldi. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued during \ntreatment with Imraldi. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than \nmethotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Imraldi 40 mg every other \nweek dosing may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every \nother week. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nDose interruption  \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer \nresulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered \nevery other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Imraldi 40 mg every other week may benefit from \nan increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of \ncontinued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient \nwith an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response is achieved \nwith 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg \nevery other week. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended Imraldi dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg \ninitially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one \nday). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n(given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Imraldi if \nnecessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a \ndaily basis during treatment with Imraldi. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Imraldi 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1). \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe recommended Imraldi induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn\u2019s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nresponse to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two \n40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \none day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \nAlternatively, if a patient has stopped Imraldi and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Imraldi may be \nre-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the \nprevious dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Imraldi 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Imraldi every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe recommended Imraldi induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \nfor two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After \ninduction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Imraldi 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Imraldi every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. \nImraldi therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in the \ninitiation of treatment with Imraldi alone. Treatment with Imraldi can be initiated in combination with \ncorticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids \nmay be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with \nImraldi. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Imraldi is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \n\nTable 1. Imraldi Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2). Imraldi is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 2. Imraldi Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Imraldi dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 3. Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg \n\nInitial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n\u2265 30 kg \n\nInitial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Imraldi is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of adalimumab \nin these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Imraldi dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week \n1 via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Imraldi 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Imraldi if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nImraldi. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Imraldi may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 4. Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n \n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \n\nStarting at \nWeek 4 \n\n< 40 kg \n\n\u2022 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \n\n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 \n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n\uf09f < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\uf09f \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged below 6 years for this indication. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4-17 years have not yet been established. No data \nare available. There is no relevant use of Imraldi in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatric arthritis. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 5). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 5 Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n \nWhen Imraldi therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \n\u2265 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are \navailable on the use of an adalimumab loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nImraldi is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nA 40 mg pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen are available for patients to administer a full 40 mg dose. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Imraldi. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Imraldi should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Imraldi \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Imraldi, should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Imraldi should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Imraldi in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nadalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Imraldi, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of \nthe risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Imraldi therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Imraldi, and in accordance with local recommendations. \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Imraldi in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed. \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Imraldi. \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists \nand this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes. \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Imraldi should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imraldi. For patients who test \npositive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis \nB is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Imraldi should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Imraldi should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated. \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating \ndisease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Imraldi in patients \nwith pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; \ndiscontinuation of Imraldi should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known \nassociation between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation \nshould be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Imraldi \ntherapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating \ndisorders. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If an \nanaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Imraldi should be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change \nin enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. \nHowever, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in \npatients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which \ncomplicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be \ncarefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated \nwith Imraldi cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional caution should be \nexercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Imraldi. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist \nin COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Imraldi. Discontinuation of Imraldi therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure  \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Imraldi should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Imraldi is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Imraldi must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes  \n \nTreatment with Imraldi may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Imraldi and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Imraldi should not be given (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists  \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature \nof the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may \nalso result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the combination of \nadalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient \nwho requires surgery while on Imraldi should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nadalimumab. \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen. Patients with rare \nhereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product. \n \nAlso, this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. \nAntibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate in comparison \nwith use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted in increased \nformation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). \n \nThe combination of Imraldi and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \nThe combination of Imraldi and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Imraldi treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The rate \nof pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7 %) in the \nadalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8 %) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted OR \n1.31, 95 % CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5 %) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4 %) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There \nwere no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary \nendpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or \nopportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be \nimpacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized \ndesign. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 \nmonths following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1 % to \n1 % of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis \nand have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nadalimumab can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nImraldi may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Imraldi (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months \nor more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and \n3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9 % for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4 % for control \ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defense against infection and cancer. \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among \nthe various indications has been included.

safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent with \nthe known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n7.2 % of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nadalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. \nThe infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections (including \nfatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis \n(including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated \nor extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nadalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nand enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with \nan exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. \nNo malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in \n60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric \npatients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 \npatient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for adalimumab \nand 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin \ncancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) \nper 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred \nat rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate (95 % confidence \ninterval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma \nskin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI \u2212 V. In these trials, 11.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and active control \u2212 \ntreated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24. \nTwo patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies \ndeveloped clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following \ndiscontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with \na control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7ULN occurred in 3.7 % of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who \nwere 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN \noccurred in 6.1 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3 % of control-treated patients. Most ALT \nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the \nPhase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to \n<4 years.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis with a \ncontrol period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 0.9 % of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6 % (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients \nand 1.8 % of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by \n40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3 % of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 0.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN \noccurred in 2.4 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4 % of control-treated patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn\u2019s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nadalimumab alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose. \n \n \n5.

Detailed information is available on the website of the European \nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-\n1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-\nreactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with adalimumab. \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in \nthe colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. Endoscopic studies in \nintestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n23 \n \n\nand safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. \nSome patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \u226518 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had insufficient \nefficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and \nwhose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u226518  years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No \nother disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u226518 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been \nintolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received \nplacebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab every week for \n52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other \nweek for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, \n497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered \nevery other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across \nRA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 7. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nTable 7 \nACR Responses in Placebo Controlled Trials \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse \nRA study Ia** RA study IIa** RA study IIIa** \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nN=60 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nN=63 \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nN=110 \n\nAdalimumabb \n \n\nN=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nN=200 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nN=207 \n\nACR 20 \n6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3% \n12 months - - - - 24.0% 58.9% \nACR 50 \n6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1% \n12 months - - - - 9.5% 41.5% \nACR 70 \n6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8% \n12 months - - - - 4.5% 23.2% \na  RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks, and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb  40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \nc  MTX = methotrexate \n**p <0.01, adalimumab versus placebo \n- Not applicable \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks. \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among \nthose, 86 patients (75.4 %) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2 %) had ACR 50 responses; and \n41 patients (36 %) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0 %) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients \n(69.1 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1 %) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p <0.001). \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab -treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 \nresponses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, combination therapy \nwith adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 8). \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nTable 8 \nACR Responses in RA Study V \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse \nMTX \n\n \nN=257 \n\nAdalimumab \n \n\nN=274 \n\nAdalimumab/ \nMTX \nN=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20 \n52 Week 62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 <0.001 0.043 \n104 Week 56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 <0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50 \n52 Week 45.9% 41.2% 61.6% <0.001 <0.001 0.317 \n104 Week 42.8% 36.9% 59.0% <0.001 <0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70 \n52 Week 27.2% 25.9% 45.5% <0.001 <0.001 0.656 \n104 Week 28.4% 28.1% 46.6% <0.001 <0.001 0.864 \n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test.  \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6 %) had \nACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0 %) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt week 52, 42.9 % of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 <2.6) compared to 20.6 % of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4 % of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy \nwas clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p <0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy (p \n<0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe \nrheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects \noriginally randomized to adalimumab monotherapy or adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy \nwho entered the open-label extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. \nAmong those, 109 subjects (63.7 %) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response  \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \nAdalimumab /methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed \nno progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated \nradiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a \nchange from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nTable 9 \nRadiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n\n \n \n\nPlacebo/MTXa \nAdalimumab/MTX \n40 mg every other \n\nweek \n\nPlacebo/MTX- \nAdalimumab/MTX \n(95% Confidence \n\nIntervalb) \n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score 2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) <0.001c \nErosion Score 1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) <0.001 \n\nJSNd Score 1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4) 0.002 \na methotrexate \nb 95 % confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and adalimumab.  \nc Based on rank analysis \nd Joint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (see Table 10). \n \n\nTable 10 \nRadiographic Mean Changes at Week 52 in RA Study V \n\n \n MTX \n\nN=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nAdalimumab  \nN=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nAdalimumab \n/MTX \nN=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nTotal Sharp \nScore 5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) <0.001 0.0020 <0.001 \n\nErosion Score 3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) <0.001 0.0082 <0.001 \nJSN Score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) <0.001 0.0037 0.151 \n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change \nfrom baseline in modified Total Sharp Score \u22640.5) was significantly higher with \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8 % and 61.2 % respectively) compared to \nmethotrexate monotherapy (37.4 % and 33.5 % respectively, p <0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy \n(50.7 %, p <0.002 and 44.5 %, p <0.001 respectively).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomized to methotrexate monotherapy, \nadalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The \ncorresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3 %, 23.7 % and 36.7 % \nrespectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four studies support \nthese findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as \nstatistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically \nsignificant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) \nscores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in quality \nof life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p <0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-\ngroup study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in phase (OL \nLI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX- treated. Patients \nwho were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two \nweeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone \n(\u2264 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and \nminimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 11. \n \n\nTable 11 \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline N (%) Minimum, median and maximum \n\n 4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n\n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or \nplacebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were \ndefined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, \nand improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group \n13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children (2 - \n<4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. \nThe patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 20 mg \nevery other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects \nused concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt week 12 and week 24, PaedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PaedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up to \n60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. Overall, 20 \nsubjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in \n46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label \n(OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg \nevery other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent \nchange from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to \ndeformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\npercent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9 %) in patients in the adalimumab group \ncompared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0 %) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in \nnumber of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through week 156 for the 26 of \n31 (84 %) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. Although not statistically \nsignificant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as \nnumber of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 \nresponse, and Paediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double \u2212 \nblind, placebo \u2212 controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of \ndisease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) patients were treated \nconcomitantly with disease modifying anti \u2212 rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) patients with glucocorticoids. \nThe blinded period was followed by an open \u2212 label period during which patients received adalimumab \n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks.

A modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS used \nfor rheumatoid arthritis), was used. \n \nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo \ntreatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.8 \u00b1 2.5 in the placebo group (at \nweek 24) compared with 0.0 \u00b1 1.9; (p<0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). \n \nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 (n=102), \n84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nAdalimumab treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function as \nassessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. Improved \nphysical function continued during the open label extension up to week 136. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (\u226510% \nBSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 or \u226510) who were candidates for \nsystemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in \nPsoriasis studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of \nadalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with \nconcomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-\nblind study (Psoriasis study III). \n \nPsoriasis study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting \none week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 \nresponse (PASI score improvement of at least 75 % relative to baseline), entered period B and received \nopen-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265PASI 75 response at week 33 \nand were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive \n40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, \nthe mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score \nranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53 % of subjects included) to \u201csevere\u201d (41 %) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6 %). \n \nPsoriasis study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate \nand placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data \navailable comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who \nachieved a \u2265PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all \ntreatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmild\u201d \n(<1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 17 and18). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nTable 17 \nPs Study I (REVEAL) - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI 75 response was calculated as centre-adjusted rate \nb p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n \n\nTable 18 \nPs Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n Placebo \n\n \nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \n \n\nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab  \n40 mg eow \n\nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6)a, b \nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7)c, d \n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1)a, b \na p<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo \nb p<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \nc p<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo \nd p<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n \nIn Psoriasis study I, 28 % of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nweek 33 compared to 5 % continuing on adalimumab, p<0.001, experienced \u201closs of adequate response\u201d \n(PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33).

PASI 75 and \nPGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7 % and 59.0 %, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6 % and \n55.7 %, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1 %[123/178] and 88.8 % [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (studies I and II) and MTX \n(study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo.  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50 %, 26.4 % (92/349) and 37.8 % (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion \nof patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet \ncompared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [p = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by \nopen-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the \nModified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail \nPsoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 19).

The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study. After \n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised in Period B \nto 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3 % of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised \nin Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A \nwere assigned to receive placebo in Period B.  \n \nPatients participating in studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study in \nwhich adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population \nwas 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50 % reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating \nScale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 21). Patients treated with adalimumab had \nsignificantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 21 \nEfficacy Results at 12 Weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n \n\n HS study I HS study II \n Placebo Adalimumab  \n\n40 mg Weekly \nPlacebo Adalimumab  \n\n40 mg Weekly \nHidradenitis \nSuppurativa \nClinical Response \n(HiSCR)a \n\nN=154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN=153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n\u2265 30% Reduction in \nSkin Painb \n\nN=109 \n27 (24.8%) \n\nN=122 \n34 (27.9%) \n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) *** \n\n* p<0.05, ***p<0.001, adalimumab versus placebo \na Among all randomised patients \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment \u2265 3, based on Numeric Rating Scale 0 \u2013 \n10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine \n \nTreatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses \nand draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in the first \n12 weeks of studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group experienced \nworsening of abscesses (23.0 % vs 11.4 %, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0 % vs 13.9 %, \nrespectively). \n \nGreater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin specific \nhealth-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; studies HS-I and \nHS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction \nQuestionnaire - medication (TSQM; studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical health as measured by the \nphysical component summary score of the SF-36 (study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nweek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 22). \n \n\nTable 22 \nProportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at Weeks 24 and 36 After \n\nTreatment Reassignment from Weekly Adalimumab at Week 12 \n \n\n Placebo \n(treatment withdrawal) \n\nN = 73 \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg \nweekly \nN = 70 \n\nWeek 24 24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \nWeek 36 22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \n\na Patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly after 12 weeks of treatment \nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no improvement were required to \ndiscontinue from the studies and were counted as nonresponders \n \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous \nweekly adalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 68.3% and at Week 96 was 65.1%. Longer \nterm treatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in studies HS-I and HS-II, the \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nHiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that \nobserved before withdrawal (56.0  %). \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab for \nthe treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. \nSafety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication \nsafety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80 % of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications. \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies, CD study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD study II (GAIN). In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and \n80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2. In CD \nstudy II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive \neither 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The primary non-\nresponders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg \nevery other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not \nin clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 23. \n\n \nTable 23 \n\nInduction of Clinical Remission and Response \n(Percent of Patients) \n\n \n CD study I: Infliximab Naive Patients CD study II: Infliximab Experienced Patients \n Placebo \n\n \nN=74 \n\nAdalimumab \n80/40 mg \n\nN=75 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nN=166 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \nWeek 4 \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \nClinical response \n\n(CR-100) 24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for adalimumab versus placebo \n*   p <0.001 \n** p <0.01 \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 and \nadverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \nIn CD study III, at week 4, 58 % (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the \nprimary analysis. Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48 % had been previously exposed to other \nTNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 24.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2). \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \nadalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CD study \nIII as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate \nthe efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight \n(<40 kg or \u226540 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with \nmoderate to severe Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) \nscore >30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to \ninfliximab. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u226540 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n<40 kg. \n \nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 25. \n \n\nTable 25 \nMaintenance regimen \n\n \nPatient Weight Low dose Standard dose \n\n<40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow \n\u226540 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow \n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score \u226410. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 26.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0 % (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0 % (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nUlcerative Colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately \nto severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) in randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies. \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at weeks 0 \nand 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nfollowed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow. \nClinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no subscore >1) was assessed at week 8. \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg eow \nthereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of remission at \nweek 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52. \n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18 % vs. 9 % respectively, p=0.031) and \nstudy UC-II (17 % vs. 9 % respectively, p=0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with adalimumab \nwho were in remission at week 8, 21/41 (51 %) were in remission at week 52. \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 28. \n \n\nTable 28 \nResponse, Remission and Mucosal Healing in Study UC-II \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n Placebo Adalimumab  \n\n40 mg eow \nWeek 52 N=246 N=248 \n\nClinical Response  18 % 30 %* \nClinical Remission  9 % 17 %* \nMucosal Healing  15 % 25 %* \nSteroid-free remission for \u2265 90 daysa  6 % \n\n(N=140) \n13 %* \n\n(N=150) \nWeek 8 and 52  \n\nSustained Response  12 % 24 %** \nSustained Remission 4 % 8 %* \nSustained Mucosal Healing  11 % 19 %* \n\nClinical remission is Mayo score \u22642 with no subscore >1; \nClinical response is decrease from baseline in Mayo score \u22653 points and \u226530% plus a decrease in the \nrectal bleeding subscore [RBS] \u22651 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1; \n*   p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n** p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions \na    Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n \nOf those patients who had a response at week 8, 47 % were in response, 29 % were in remission, 41 % \nhad mucosal healing, and 20 % were in steroid-free remission for \u226590 days at week 52. \n \nApproximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. The \nefficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF na\u00efve patients. Among \npatients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved by 3 % on placebo and \n10 % on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term extension \nstudy (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75 % (301/402) continued to be in clinical \nremission per partial Mayo score. \n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number \nof all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. 0.26 per \npatient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 \nper patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease \nQuestionnaire (IBDQ) score. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double- \nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial \ndose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant \nstable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently \nunderwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \nClinical Response \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure \nin patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 29). Both studies \ndemonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus placebo \n(see Figure 2). \n \n\nTable 29 \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n\nTreatment N \nFailure N \n\n(%) \nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) HR\n\na CI 95% for HR \nP \n\nValueb \nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in study UV I \nPrimary analysis (ITT) \nPlacebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 - - - \nAdalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36,0.70 <0.001 \nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT) \nPlacebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 - - - \nAdalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39,0.84 0.004 \nNote:  Treatment failure at or after week 6 (study UV I), or at or after week 2 (study UV II), was counted \nas event.

In study UV II, statistically significant differences were \nobserved for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no active \ninflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \u2264 7.5 mg \nper day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \nletters deterioration) in 88.6 % of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent \nwith these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall,among the patients \nwho discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 8 % due to insufficient response \nto adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. Vision related effects \nwere not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UVI and for colour vision, \nperipheral vision and near vision in study UV II. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of \n90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. Adalimumab \nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75 % relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95 % CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \nStudy \n\n \n\nPR\nO\n\nB\nA\n\nB\nIL\n\nIT\nY\n\n O\nF \n\nFA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n \n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment  Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-adalimumab \nantibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. There is no \napparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the occurrence of adverse \nevents. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in \nulcerative colitis, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was \nslow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average \nabsolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nsubcutaneous dose was 64 %. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to \n15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life \nwas approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid \narthritis patients ranged from 31-96 % of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u03bcg/ml (without \nconcomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u03bcg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. The serum \nadalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and \n80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week \nto patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough \nsteady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5g/ml \n(102 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b5g/ml (47.7 % CV) with \nconcomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg dosed \nwith adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was 6.0 \u00b1 \n6.1 \u00b5g/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5g/ml (71.2% CV) \nwith concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week \nto patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values \nmeasured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/ml for adalimumab without \nconcomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (\u00b1SD) trough steady-state concentration at Week \n68 was 8.0 \u00b1 4.6 \u03bcg/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u03bcg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week \nto paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab trough \nconcentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg/ml at \nweek 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to \nadalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response \nmay benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u03bcg/ml were observed in \nCrohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. At \nweek 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u00b5g/ml for patients \u226540 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6\u00b16.1 \u00b5g/ml for patients <40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough concentrations \nat week 52 were 9.5\u00b15.6 \u03bcg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5\u00b12.2 \u03bcg/ml for the Low Dose group. \nThe mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab \ntreatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean \n(\u00b1SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3\u00b111.4 \u03bcg/ml (40/20 mg, weekly) and \n6.7\u00b13.5 \u03bcg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 \u03bcg/ml were observed in \nulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted \ncomparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when \ncompared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with \nadolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship \nwas established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab \nplasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was 3 \n\u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml).  \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, respectively. \nPASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, both with a \nsimilar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum levels \nof free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in \npatients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated \ndose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for \nan antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies \nin rodents. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nImraldi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Imraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of \nintolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the \nefficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than \n2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section \n5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from \n4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy \nand phototherapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) \nin adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or \nin whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nImraldi treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of conditions for which Imraldi is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with \nan appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Imraldi (see section 4.4). Patients treated with \nImraldi should be given the Patient Reminder cCard. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Imraldi if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Imraldi, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years \nof age is based on body weight (Table 1). Imraldi is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 1 Imraldi Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued \ntherapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is based \non body weight (Table 2). Imraldi is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 2 Imraldi Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Imraldi dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 3 Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg \n\nInitial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n\u2265 30 kg \n\nInitial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nIf retreatment with Imraldi is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS.  \n \nThe posology of adalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and \nsimulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Imraldi dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week \n1 via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Imraldi 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Imraldi if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nImraldi. \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Imraldi may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in \nsection 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 4 Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n \n\nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \n\nStarting at \nWeek 4 \n\n< 40 kg \n\n\u2022 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \n\n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 \n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n\uf09f < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\uf09f \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged below 6 years for this indication. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n  \nThe recommended dose of Imraldi for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 5). Imraldi is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 5 Imraldi Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n \nWhen Imraldi therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \n\u2265 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are \navailable on the use of an adalimumab loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nImraldi has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nImraldi is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nA 40 mg pre-filled pen and a 40 mg pre-filled syringe are also available for patients to administer a full 40 \nmg dose. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may \nincrease the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, \nincluding tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Imraldi. Because the elimination of \nadalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period. \n \nTreatment with Imraldi should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and \npatients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Imraldi \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Imraldi, should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Imraldi should be discontinued if \na patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy \nshould be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nthe use of Imraldi in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nadalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Imraldi, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of \nthe risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Imraldi therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Imraldi, and in accordance with local recommendations. \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Imraldi in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed. \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Imraldi. \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists \nand this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Imraldi should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imraldi. For patients who test \npositive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis \nB is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Imraldi should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Imraldi should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated. \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating \ndisease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Imraldi in patients \nwith pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; \ndiscontinuation of Imraldi should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known \nassociation between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation \nshould be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Imraldi \ntherapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating \ndisorders. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If an \nanaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Imraldi should be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change \nin enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. \nHowever, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in \npatients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which \ncomplicates the risk estimation. With \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other \nmalignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be \ncarefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated \nwith Imraldi cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional caution should be \nexercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Imraldi. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist \nin COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Imraldi. Discontinuation of Imraldi therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure  \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Imraldi should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Imraldi is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Imraldi must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes  \n \nTreatment with Imraldi may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Imraldi and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Imraldi should not be given (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists  \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature \nof the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may \nalso result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the combination of \nadalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The long \nhalf-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient \nwho requires surgery while on Imraldi should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nadalimumab. \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each vial. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \nfructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product. \n \nAlso, this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. \nAntibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate in comparison \nwith use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted in increased \nformation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). \n \nThe combination of Imraldi and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \nThe combination of Imraldi and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Imraldi treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The rate \nof pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7 %) in the \nadalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8 %) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted OR \n1.31, 95 % CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5 %) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4 %) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There \nwere no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary \nendpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or \nopportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be \nimpacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized \ndesign. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 \nmonths following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1 % to \n1 % of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis \nand have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nadalimumab can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nImraldi may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Imraldi (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months \nor more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as \nwell as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, \nand uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and \n3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9 % for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4 % for control \ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \nheadache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defense against infection and cancer. \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation \nand various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use \nof adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of \nlupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing \nexperience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among \nthe various indications has been included.

safety profile for patients with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known \nsafety profile of adalimumab. \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent with \nthe known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to \n7.2 % of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the \nadalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. \nThe infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most \npatients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 per \npatient year in placebo and active control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections (including \nfatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis \n(including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated \nor extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, \naspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after \ninitiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during \nadalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nand enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with \nan exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. \nNo malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in \n60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric \npatients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 \npatient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for adalimumab \nand 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin \ncancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) \nper 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred \nat rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate (95 % confidence \ninterval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma \nskin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.3 \nper 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nadalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies \nI \u2212 V. In these trials, 11.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and active control \u2212 \ntreated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24. \nTwo patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies \ndeveloped clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following \ndiscontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with \na control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7ULN occurred in 3.7 % of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 1.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who \nwere 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN \noccurred in 6.1 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3 % of control-treated patients. Most ALT \nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the \nPhase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to \n<4 years.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis with a \ncontrol period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 0.9 % of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6 % (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period duration \nranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients \nand 1.8 % of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis.  \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by \n40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3 % of adalimumab-\n\n\n\n68 \n \n\ntreated patients and 0.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and \n105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN \noccurred in 2.4 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4 % of control-treated patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such \nas hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn\u2019s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with \nadalimumab alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been \nmultiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nImraldi is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes \nin the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-\n1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-\nreactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with adalimumab. \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in \nthe colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. Endoscopic studies in \nintestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with active \npolyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset types \n(most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-\ngroup study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in phase (OL \nLI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX- treated. Patients \nwho were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two \nweeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone \n(\u2264 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a \nmaximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and \nminimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in Table 7. \n \n\nTable 7 \nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline N (%) Minimum, median and maximum \n\n 4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n\n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n \nPatients demonstrating a Paediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the \ndouble blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or \nplacebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were \ndefined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Paediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, \nand improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease flare, patients \nwere eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nTable 8 \nPaed ACR 30 Responses in the JIA study \n\n \nStratum MTX Without MTX Phase \n\nOL-LI 16 weeks \n\nPed ACR 30 response (n/N) 94.1 % (80/85) 74.4 % (64/86) \n\nEfficacy Outcomes \n\nDouble Blind 32 weeks Adalimumab /MTX (N=38) \nPlacebo / MTX \n\n(N=37) \nAdalimumab  \n\n(N=30) \nPlacebo \n(N=28) \n\nDisease flares at the end of \n32 weeksa (n/N) 36.8 % (14/38) 64.9 % (24/37)\n\nb 43.3 % (13/30) 71.4 % (20/28)c \n\nMedian time to disease flare >32 weeks 20 weeks >32 weeks 14 weeks \na Ped ACR 30/50/70 responses week 48 significantly greater than those of placebo treated patients \nb p = 0.015 \nc p = 0.031 \n \nAmongst those who responded at week 16 (n=144), the Paediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were \nmaintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the \nstudy. Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group \n13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the \ncombination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children (2 - \n<4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. \nThe patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 20 mg \nevery other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects \nused concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt week 12 and week 24, PaedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PaedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Paediatric \nACR 30) at week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up to \n60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. Overall, 20 \nsubjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in \n46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label \n(OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg \nevery other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent \nchange from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to \ndeformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\npercent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9 %) in patients in the adalimumab group \ncompared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0 %) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in \nnumber of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through week 156 for the 26 of \n31 (84 %) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. Although not statistically \nsignificant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as \nnumber of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 \nresponse, and Paediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy \nand safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. \nSome patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \u226518 \nyears old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had insufficient \nefficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and \nwhose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u226518 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of \n20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No \nother disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u226518 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been \nintolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received \nplacebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab every week for \n52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on \nalternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension \nphase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic \ndrug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a \nminimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, \nsulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other \nweek for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of \nprogression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, \n497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered \nevery other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and V \nhad an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray \nresults). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \nACR response \n \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across \nRA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in Table 9. \n \n\nTable 9 \nACR Responses in Placebo Controlled Trials \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse \nRA study Ia** RA study IIa** RA study IIIa** \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nN=60 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nN=63 \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nN=110 \n\nAdalimumabb \n \n\nN=113 \n\nPlacebo/ \nMTXc \nN=200 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nN=207 \n\nACR 20 \n6 months 13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3% \n12 months - - - - 24.0% 58.9% \nACR 50 \n6 months 6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1% \n12 months - - - - 9.5% 41.5% \nACR 70 \n6 months 3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8% \n12 months - - - - 4.5% 23.2% \na  RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks, and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb  40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \nc  MTX = methotrexate \n**p <0.01, adalimumab versus placebo \n- Not applicable \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and swollen \njoints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) scores and \nCRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, these \nimprovements were maintained throughout 52 weeks. \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among \nthose, 86 patients (75.4 %) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2 %) had ACR 50 responses; and \n41 patients (36 %) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0 %) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients \n(69.1 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1 %) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p <0.001). \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab -treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 \nresponses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, combination therapy \nwith adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 10). \n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\nTable 10 \nACR Responses in RA Study V \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n\nResponse \nMTX \n\n \nN=257 \n\nAdalimumab \n \n\nN=274 \n\nAdalimumab/ \nMTX \nN=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20 \n52 Week 62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 <0.001 0.043 \n104 Week 56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 <0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50 \n52 Week 45.9% 41.2% 61.6% <0.001 <0.001 0.317 \n104 Week 42.8% 36.9% 59.0% <0.001 <0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70 \n52 Week 27.2% 25.9% 45.5% <0.001 <0.001 0.656 \n104 Week 28.4% 28.1% 46.6% <0.001 <0.001 0.864 \n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test.  \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for up to \n10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 patients \ncontinued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients (90.6 %) had \nACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients (60.0 %) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nAt week 52, 42.9 % of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 <2.6) compared to 20.6 % of patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy and \n23.4 % of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy \nwas clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p <0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy (p \n<0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe \nrheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects \noriginally randomized to adalimumab monotherapy or adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy \nwho entered the open-label extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. \nAmong those, 109 subjects (63.7 %) were reported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response  \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \nAdalimumab /methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 11). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with \n40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed \nno progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At \n10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated \nradiographically.

The \ncorresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3 %, 23.7 % and 36.7 % \nrespectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health \nAssessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a \npre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four \nstudies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nbaseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from \nthe Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of adalimumab in all four studies support \nthese findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as \nstatistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically \nsignificant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) \nscores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment \nmaintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in quality \nof life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p <0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of \n114 paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a \nPhysician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) \u22654 or >20% BSA involvement or >10 % BSA involvement with \nvery thick lesions or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226520 or \u226510 with clinically relevant facial, \ngenital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy and \nheliotherapy or phototherapy. \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1 \u2013 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At Week 16, more patients randomised to \nadalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to \n0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX. \n \n\nTable 13 \nPaediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n MTXa \n\nN=37 \nAdalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow \n\nN=38 \nPASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \nPGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \n\na MTX = methotrexate \nb P=0.027, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \nc P=0.083, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients \nwere then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates \nobserved during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response of 78.9 % \n(15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6 % (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for \nup to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (\u226510% \nBSA involvement and PASI \u226512 or \u226510) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in \nrandomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in Psoriasis studies I and II had received prior \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nsystemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult \npatients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who \nwere candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study (Psoriasis study III). \n \nPsoriasis study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting \none week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 \nresponse (PASI score improvement of at least 75 % relative to baseline), entered period B and received \nopen-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265PASI 75 response at week 33 \nand were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive \n40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, \nthe mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53 % of \nsubjects included) to \u201csevere\u201d (41 %) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6 %). \n \nPsoriasis study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate \nand placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose \nincreases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data \navailable comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who \nachieved a \u2265PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all \ntreatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmild\u201d \n(<1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-label \nextension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 14 and 15). \n \n\nTable 14 \nPs Study I (REVEAL) - Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n\n \nPlacebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI 75 response was calculated as centre-adjusted rate \nb p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n \n\nTable 15 \nPs Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks \n\n \n Placebo \n\n \nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \n \n\nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab  \n40 mg eow \n\nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6)a, b \nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7)c, d \n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1)a, b \na p<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo \nb p<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \nc p<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo \nd p<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\nIn Psoriasis study I, 28 % of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo at \nweek 33 compared to 5 % continuing on adalimumab, p<0.001, experienced \u201closs of adequate response\u201d \n(PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response relative to \nbaseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33). Of the patients who lost \nadequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension trial, \n38 % (25/66) and 55 % (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, \nrespectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy for \n52 weeks in Psoriasis study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 and \nPGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7 % and 59.0 %, respectively, after an \nadditional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who \ndropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered \nnon-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6 % and \n55.7 %, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label \nextension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median \ntime to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients \nexperienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of patients who entered the \nretreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective \nof whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1 %[123/178] and 88.8 % [95/107] for patients who \nrelapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was \nobserved during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (studies I and II) and MTX \n(study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In study I, improvements in \nthe physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo.  \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg \nweekly due to a PASI response below 50 %, 26.4 % (92/349) and 37.8 % (132/349) of patients achieved \nPASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion \nof patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet \ncompared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [p = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients with \nmoderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by \n40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by \nopen-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the \nModified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail \nPsoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 16). Adalimumab \ndemonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement \n(BSA\u226510 % (60 % of patients) and BSA<10 % and \u22655 % (40 % of patients)). \n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nTable 16 \nPs Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 Weeks \n\n \n\nEndpoint \n\nWeek 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled \n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled \n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=80 \n\u2265 mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal \nand \u22652-grade \nimprovement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in Total \nFingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n \nAdalimumab treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with \nplacebo in the DLQI. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab for \nthe treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. \nSafety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-indication \nsafety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nAdult hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis \nsuppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-\nmonth trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study. After \n12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised in Period B \nto 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or \nplacebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A were \nassigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients received \nplacebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg every week \nstarting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3 % of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-randomised \nin Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other \nweek, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in Period A \nwere assigned to receive placebo in Period B.  \n \nPatients participating in studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study in \nwhich adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population \nwas 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50 % reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating \nScale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. \n \nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo achieved \nHiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in study HS-II experienced a clinically \nrelevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 17). Patients treated with adalimumab had \nsignificantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 17 \nEfficacy Results at 12 Weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n \n\n HS Study I HS Study II \n Placebo Adalimumab  \n\n40 mg Weekly \nPlacebo Adalimumab  \n\n40 mg Weekly \nHidradenitis \nSuppurativa Clinical \nResponse (HiSCR)a \n\nN=154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN=153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n\u2265 30% Reduction in \nSkin Painb \n\nN=109 \n27 (24.8%) \n\nN=122 \n34 (27.9%) \n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) *** \n\n* p<0.05, ***p<0.001, adalimumab versus placebo \na Among all randomised patients \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment \u2265 3, based on Numeric Rating Scale 0 \u2013 \n10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine \n \nTreatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses \nand draining fistulas.

Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to \ninfliximab. \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: 160 mg \nat week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u226540 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for subjects \n<40 kg. \n \nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low Dose or \nStandard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 19. \n \n\nTable 19 \nMaintenance regimen \n\n \nPatient Weight Low dose Standard dose \n\n<40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow \n\u226540 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow \n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score \u226410. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points from \nBaseline) rates are presented in Table 20.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0 % (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in the \nstudy continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0 % (46/50) of patients continued to be in clinical \nresponse per PCDAI. \n \nAdult Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80 % of patients continued to receive at least one of these \nmedications. \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies, CD study I \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n(CLASSIC I) and CD study II (GAIN). In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and \n80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2. In CD \nstudy II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive \neither 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The primary non-\nresponders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 patients \nreceived open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg \nevery other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 56 weeks. Patients in \nclinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not \nin clinical response at week 4.

Clinical \nremission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at week 56. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nTable 23 \nMaintenance of Clinical Remission and Response \n\n(Percent of Patients) \n \n Placebo \n\n \n40 mg Adalimumab \n\nevery other week \n40 mg Adalimumab \n\nevery week \nWeek 26  N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission  17 % 40 %* 47 %* \nClinical response (CR-100)  27 % 52 %* 52 %* \nPatients in steroid-free remission \nfor >=90 daysa  3 % (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission 12 % 36 %* 41 %* \nClinical response (CR-100)  17 % 41 %* 48 %* \nPatients in steroid-free remission \nfor >=90 daysa  5 % (3/66) 29 % (17/58)* 20 % (15/74)** \n\n*   p <0.001 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \n** p <0.02 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions \na   Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n \nAmong patients who were not in response at week 4, 43 % of adalimumab maintenance patients \nresponded by week 12 compared to 30 % of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section \n4.2). \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through \nat least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in \nclinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory \nbowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to \nadalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CD study \nIII as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of \n90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious anterior uveitis \nwho were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or \n20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with \ntheir baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development \nof sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of \nconcomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 1, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated \nwith placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with \nadalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. Adalimumab \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\nsignificantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75 % relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard \nratio (HR = 0.25 [95 % CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric Uveitis \n\nStudy \n \n\nPR\nO\n\nB\nA\n\nB\nIL\n\nIT\nY\n\n O\nF \n\nFA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\n \n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment  Placebo  Adalimumab \n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nAdult Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, \nposterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double- \nmasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial \ndose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant \nstable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently \nunderwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure \nin patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 24). Both studies \ndemonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus placebo \n(see Figure 2). \n \n\nTable 24 \nTime to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n\n \nAnalysis \n\nTreatment N \nFailure N \n\n(%) \nMedian Time to Failure \n\n(months) HR\na CI 95% for HR \n\nP \nValueb \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 6 in Study UV I \nPrimary analysis (ITT) \nPlacebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 - - - \nAdalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36,0.70 <0.001 \nTime to Treatment Failure At or After Week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT) \nPlacebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 - - - \nAdalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39,0.84 0.004 \nNote: Treatment failure at or after week 6 (study UV I), or at or after week 2 (study UV II), was counted \nas event.

In study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to \ndiabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary \nanalysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of \nopen-label adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in \nquiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a \nconcomitant steroid dose \u2264 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA \nwas either improved or maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data \n\n\n\n87 \n\nbeyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects \ndeclined after this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued \ndue to adverse events, and 8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical \nstudies, using the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores \nwith statistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental \nhealth, and total score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. Vision \nrelated effects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UVI and for \ncolour vision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-\nadalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. \nThere is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 \u00b1 \n5.6 \u00b5g/ml (102 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b5g/ml \n(47.7 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5g/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 \n5.6 \u00b5g/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg/ml with concomitant methotrexate \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/ml (79% CV). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u00b5g/ml for patients \u226540 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6\u00b16.1 \u00b5g/ml for patients <40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5\u00b15.6 \u03bcg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5\u00b12.2 \u03bcg/ml for the \nLow Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (\u00b1SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3\u00b111.4 \u03bcg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7\u00b13.5 \u03bcg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was \n3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nAdults \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64 %. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-\nlife was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96 % of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u03bcg/ml \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u03bcg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u03bcg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg/ml at \nweek 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \n\n\n\n89 \n\napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u03bcg/ml were observed \nin Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be \nlower in patients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising \nantibodies in rodents. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before you are given Imraldi and during treatment with \nImraldi. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you during your treatment and for 4 months after \nyour (or your child\u2019s) last injection of Imraldi. \n\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet (See section 4). \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Imraldi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Imraldi \n3. How to use Imraldi  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Imraldi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Imraldi is and what it is used for \n \nImraldi contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nImraldi is intended for treatment of: \n\uf09f rheumatoid arthritis,  \n\uf09f polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\uf09f enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n\uf09f ankylosing spondylitis,  \n\uf09f axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n\uf09f psoriatic arthritis,  \n\uf09f psoriasis,  \n\uf09f hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n\uf09f Crohn\u2019s disease,  \n\uf09f ulcerative colitis and  \n\uf09f non-infectious uveitis.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Imraldi, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Imraldi decreases \nthe process of inflammation in these diseases. \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nImraldi is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nImraldi can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nImraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Imraldi is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nImraldi can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n \nImraldi is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, patients will be given Imraldi to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nor enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nImraldi is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the signs \nand symptoms of your disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nImraldi is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Imraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage \nand bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \n\n\n\n113 \n\nImraldi is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Imraldi is also used to treat \nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents weighing 30 kg or greater for whom topical \ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, \ngroin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nImraldi is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Imraldi \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you \nwill be given Imraldi. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nImraldi is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn\u2019s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will \nbe given Imraldi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nImraldi is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  \n \nImraldi is used to treat  \n\uf09f Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye \n\uf09f Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting \n\nthe front of the eye \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black \ndots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Imraldi works by reducing this inflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Imraldi \n \nDo not use Imraldi \n- If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n- If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \nor have a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Imraldi. \n \nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more Imraldi and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Imraldi. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  \n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Imraldi treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic \ninfections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood \npoisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Imraldi, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Imraldi. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), \nor any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, \n\ncoccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \nfor HBV. Imraldi can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, \nreactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Imraldi. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \nwith Imraldi. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \nImraldi. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Imraldi. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, and \n\nthese vaccines should not be given while receiving Imraldi. Check with your doctor before you \nreceive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled \nvaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Imraldi. If you receive Imraldi while \nyou are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five \nmonths after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Imraldi use during your pregnancy \nso they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Imraldi, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Imraldi. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or \n\nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking Imraldi \n\nor other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If \nyou take Imraldi the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On \nrare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking \nImraldi. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or \nmercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Imraldi. \n\n\u2022 In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Imraldi. \nIf new areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of \ndamage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of \nlung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \nblocker. If you have COPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nLupus-like syndrome \n \n\n\n\n116 \n\n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Imraldi could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Imraldi to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of \n\n2 years. \n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Imraldi \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nImraldi can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Imraldi with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due \nto increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \n\nuse for at least 5 months after the last Imraldi injection. \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\u2022 Imraldi should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Imraldi can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If you received Imraldi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection.  \n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nImraldi use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information \non vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nImraldi may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Imraldi. \n \nImraldi contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe.

Instructions for use \n \nFollow this instruction guide carefully, and soon you will develop a routine for injecting confidently. \n\u2022 Before you inject, ask your doctor or nurse to show you how to use your pre-filled syringe. \n\nYour doctor or nurse should make sure you can use your syringe correctly. \n \nYour single-dose pre-filled syringe \n \n\n \n \nAfter you push the plunger all the way down, the needle will retract to help prevent needle stick injury. \n \nCaring for your pre-filled syringe \n \nSyringe storage \n\u2022 Store your syringe in the refrigerator, but do not freeze it. \n\u2022 Keep your syringe in its carton, and away from light. \n\u2022 Keep the syringe out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nSyringe disposal \n\u2022 Use each syringe only once. Never reuse a syringe. \n\u2022 Throw away your used syringe in a special container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist. \n \n\nCautions \n\u2022 If you dropped your syringe with the cap ON, it is okay to use the syringe. \n\nIf you dropped your syringe with the cap OFF, do not use it. The needle might be dirty or \ndamaged. \n\n\u2022 Do not use a damaged syringe. \n \nInjection site care \n \n\u2022 Choose a fatty area for injection: \n\nFatty areas, like your stomach, are generally the best injection sites. Fatty areas are easier to \npinch and are good for inserting the needle correctly. \n\n\u2022 Use a different injection site every time: \nWhen choosing an injection site, select an area that has not recently been used to avoid soreness \nand bruises. \n\n\n\n127 \n\n\u2022 Press plunger slowly: \nSometimes, fast injections can be painful. If you press the syringe plunger slowly, it may make \nyour injection more comfortable. \n \n\nHow to inject with your pre-filled syringe \n \n\n1. Gather supplies \n\n \nPlace your pre-filled syringe and alcohol pads on a clean, dry surface.  \n\uf09f Remember to wash your hands! \n\uf09f Do not remove the cap just yet! \n \n2. Wait 15-30 minutes \n\n \nWait 15-30 minutes for your pre-filled syringe to reach to room temperature, which helps reduce your \npain during injection. \n\uf09f Do not remove the cap just yet! \n\n \n3. Inspect medicine & expiration date \n\n \nAlways make sure your medicine is clear, free of particles, and has not expired. If your medication is \nnot clear, free of particles, or expired, do not use it. \nYou may see an air bubble, and that is okay. There is no reason to remove it. \n\uf09f Do not remove the cap just yet! \n\n \n4. Choose an injection site & clean skin \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \nChoose an injection site on your body. Your abdomen (except the area around the navel) or thighs are \nbest.  \nClean your injection site with an alcohol pad.

Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Imraldi is and what it is used for \n \nImraldi contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nImraldi is intended for treatment of: \n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis  \n\u2022 ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis, \n\u2022 psoriasis, \n\u2022 hidradenitis suppurativa, \n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\u2022 ulcerative colitis and  \n\u2022 non-infectious uveitis. \n \nThe active ingredient in Imraldi, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target. \n \n\n\n\n131 \n\nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Imraldi decreases \nthe process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nImraldi is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nImraldi can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nImraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Imraldi is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nImraldi can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n \nImraldi is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, patients will be given Imraldi to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nor enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nImraldi is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the signs \nand symptoms of your disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nImraldi is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Imraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage \nand bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \n\n\n\n132 \n\ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \nImraldi is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Imraldi is also used to treat \nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents weighing 30 kg or greater for whom topical \ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, \ngroin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nImraldi is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Imraldi \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you \nwill be given Imraldi. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nImraldi is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn\u2019s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will \nbe given Imraldi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nImraldi is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  \n \nImraldi is used to treat  \n\u2022 Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye \n\u2022 Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting \n\nthe front of the eye \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black \ndots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Imraldi works by reducing this inflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Imraldi \n \nDo not use Imraldi \n- If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n- If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \nor have a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Imraldi. \n \nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more Imraldi and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Imraldi. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Imraldi treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic \ninfections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood \npoisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Imraldi, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Imraldi. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), \nor any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, \n\ncoccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \nfor HBV. Imraldi can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, \nreactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Imraldi. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \n\n\n\n134 \n\nwith Imraldi. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nImraldi. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Imraldi. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, and \n\nthese vaccines should not be given while receiving Imraldi. Check with your doctor before you \nreceive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled \nvaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Imraldi. If you receive Imraldi while \nyou are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five \nmonths after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Imraldi use during your pregnancy \nso they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Imraldi, your heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should receive Imraldi. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or \n\nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking Imraldi \n\nor other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If \nyou take Imraldi the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On \nrare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking \nImraldi. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or \nmercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Imraldi. \n\n\u2022 In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Imraldi. \nIf new areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of \ndamage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of \nlung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \n\n\n\n135 \n\nblocker. If you have COPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nLupus-like syndrome \n \n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Imraldi could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Imraldi to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of \n\n2 years. \n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Imraldi \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nImraldi can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Imraldi with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due \nto increased risk of serious infection.. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \n\nuse for at least 5 months after the last Imraldi injection.  \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\u2022 Imraldi should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Imraldi can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If you received Imraldi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection.  \n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nImraldi use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information \non vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section).  \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nImraldi may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Imraldi. \n \nImraldi contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled pen. If you have been told by your \ndoctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nAlso this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n \n3.

Instructions for use \n \nFollow this instruction guide carefully, and soon you will develop a routine for injecting confidently. \n\u2022 Before you inject, ask your doctor or nurse to show you how to use your pre-filled pen. Your \n\ndoctor or nurse should make sure you can use your pen correctly. \n \nYour single-dose pre-filled pen \n \n\n \n \nThere is no button on your pre-filled pen. \nThe needle is hidden below the green base. When you push the pre-filled pen firmly onto your skin, \nthe injection will start automatically. \n \nCaring for your pre-filled pen \n \nPen storage \n\u2022 Store your pen in the refrigerator, but do not freeze it. \n\u2022 Keep your pen in its carton, and away from light. \n\u2022 Keep the pen out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nPen disposal \n\u2022 Use each pen only once. Never reuse a pen. \n\u2022 Throw away your used pen in a special container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist. \n \n\nCautions \n\u2022 If you dropped your pen with the cap ON, it is okay to use the pen. \n\nIf you dropped your pen with the cap OFF, do not use it. The needle might be dirty or damaged.  \n\u2022 Do not use a damaged pen. \n\n\n\n146 \n\nInjection site care \n \n\u2022 Choose a fatty area for injection: \n\nFatty areas, like your stomach, are generally the best injection sites. Fatty areas are good for \ninserting the needle correctly. \n\n\u2022 Use a different injection site every time: \nWhen choosing an injection site, select an area that has not recently been used to avoid soreness \nand bruises. \n\n \nHow to inject with your pre-filled pen \n\n \n1. Gather supplies \n\n \nPlace your pre-filled pen and alcohol pads on a clean, dry surface.  \n\u2022 Remember to wash your hands! \n\u2022 Do not remove the cap just yet! \n \n2. Wait 15-30 minutes \n\n \nWait 15-30 minutes for your pre-filled pen to reach to room temperature, which helps reduce your \npain during injection. \n\u2022 Do not remove the cap just yet!  \n \n3. Inspect medicine & expiration date \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \nAlways make sure your medicine is clear, free of particles, and has not expired. If your medication is \nnot clear, free of particles, or expired, do not use it. \nYou may see an air bubble, and that is okay. There is no reason to remove it. \n\u2022 Do not remove the cap just yet! \n \n4. Choose an injection site & clean skin \n\n \nChoose an injection site on your body. Your abdomen (except the area around the navel) or thighs are \nbest.  \nClean your injection site with an alcohol pad. Do not touch the area again before the injection. \n\u2022 Avoid skin that is sore, bruised, scarred, scaly, or has red patches. \n \n5. Pull off the clear needle cap \n\n \nCarefully pull off the clear needle cap with a metal center from the pen.  \nIt is normal to see a few drops of liquid come out of the needle. \nIf you take off the needle cap before you are ready to inject, do not put the needle cap back on. This \ncould bend or damage the needle. You might accidentally stick yourself or waste medication. \n \n6. Place greenbase, press down, and hold \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \nPlace the greenbase straight (90 degrees) on your skin, and push the entire pre-filled pen down firmly \nto start the injection. \n\u2022 When you push down, the injection starts. You may hear a 1st click. \n \n7. Continue to hold \n\n \nHold the pen against your skin until the yellow indicator fills the medication window and stops \nmoving. \n\u2022 Several seconds later you may hear a 2nd click. \n \n8. Confirm completion & dispose \n\n \nAfter injecting Imraldi, confirm that the entire medication window is yellow. \nThrow away the used pen in a special container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\u2022  Not sure if you received your dose? Contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n149 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nImraldi 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection \nadalimumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before your child is given Imraldi and during treatment \nwith Imraldi. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you or your child during his/her treatment \nand for 4 months after your child\u2019s last injection of Imraldi. \n\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child's.  \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet (See section 4). \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Imraldi is and what it is used for  \n2.

Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Imraldi is and what it is used for \n \nImraldi contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nImraldi is intended for treatment of: \n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n\u2022 paediatric plaque psoriasis,  \n\u2022 adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa,  \n\u2022 paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\u2022 paediatric uveitis. \n \nThe active ingredient in Imraldi, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target. \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Imraldi decreases \nthe process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\n\n\n150 \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n \nImraldi is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis. \nPatients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Imraldi to treat their polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \nImraldi is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years in whom \ntopical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, \ngroin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nImraldi is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents from 12 years of age. Imraldi can \nreduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the \ndisease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will \nbe given Imraldi. \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nImraldi is indicated for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease in children aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given \nImraldi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. \n \nImraldi is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with \ninflammation affecting the front of the eye. This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or \nthe presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). \nImraldi works by reducing this inflammation. \n \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Imraldi \n \nDo not use Imraldi \n- If your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It \n\nis important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n\n\n151 \n\n- If your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \nhas had or has a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist before using Imraldi. \n \nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more Imraldi and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If your child has an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Imraldi. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  \n\u2022 Your child might get infections more easily while receiving Imraldi treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if his/her lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic \ninfections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood \npoisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \ndoctor if your child gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \nYour doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. \n\n \nTuberculosis \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Imraldi, your doctor will \n\ncheck your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Imraldi. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your child\u2019s medical history and screening \ntests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests \nshould be recorded on your child\u2019s Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she has been in close contact with \nsomeone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child \nhas received preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent \ncough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after \ntherapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child resides or travels in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active \n\nHBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your child\u2019s doctor \nshould test your child for HBV. Imraldi can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this \nvirus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\u2022 If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that he/she is \n\ntaking Imraldi. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation. \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \n\naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he/she should receive \nor continue to receive Imraldi. Tell your doctor immediately if your child gets symptoms like \nchanges in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, and \n\nthese vaccines should not be given while receiving Imraldi. Check with your doctor before your \nchild receives any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the \nscheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Imraldi. If you receive \nImraldi while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up \nto about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you \ntell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Imraldi use during your \npregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 If your child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Imraldi, his/her heart failure status \n\nmust be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if your child has \nhad or has a serious heart condition. If he/she develops new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor will decide if your child should receive Imraldi. \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or \n\nhelp him/her to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, or he/she \nbruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking Imraldi \n\nor other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the \ndisease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that \naffects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If \nyour child takes Imraldi the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. \nOn rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking \nImraldi. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or \nmercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with \nImraldi. \n\n\u2022 In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Imraldi. \nIf new areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of \ndamage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of \nlung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \nblocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for your child. \n\n \nLupus-like syndrome \n \n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Imraldi could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \nOther medicines and Imraldi \n \nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nImraldi can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYour child should not take Imraldi with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection . If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \n\nuse for at least 5 months after the last Imraldi injection.  \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\u2022 Imraldi should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Imraldi can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If you received Imraldi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection.  \nIt is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your Imraldi \nuse during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see \nthe \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section). \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nImraldi may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Imraldi. \n \nImraldi contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nThis medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each vial. If your child has been told by doctor that \nhe/she has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \nAlso this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Imraldi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist has instructed.

Instructions for use \n \nThe following instructions explain how to inject Imraldi. Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step. You will be instructed by your child's doctor or his/her assistant on the \ntechnique of injection and the amount to give to your child. Do not attempt to give your child an \ninjection until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. After proper \ntraining, the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a family \nmember or friend. \n \nFailure to perform the following steps as described may cause contamination which may lead to \ninfection of your child. \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine. \n \nCaring for your vial  \n \nVial storage \n\u2022 Store your vial in the refrigerator, but do not freeze it. \n\u2022 Keep your vial in its carton, and away from light. \n\u2022 Keep the vial out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nVial disposal \n\u2022 Use each vial only once. Never reuse a vial and other components. \n\u2022 Throw away your used vial in a special container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist. \n \nInjection site care \n \n\u2022 Choose a fatty area for injection: \n\nFatty areas, like your stomach, are generally the best injection sites. Fatty areas are easier to \npinch and are good for inserting the needle correctly. \n\n\u2022 Use a different injection site every time: \nWhen choosing an injection site, select an area that has not recently been used to avoid soreness \nand bruises. \n\n\u2022 Press plunger slowly: \nSometimes, fast injections can be painful. If you press the syringe plunger slowly, it may make \nyour injection more comfortable. \n\n \nHow to inject with your vial \n \n1)  Setting up  \n \n\u2022 Make sure you know the proper amount (volume) needed for dosing. If you don\u2019t know the \n\namount, STOP HERE and contact your doctor for further instruction. \n\u2022 You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your \n\nnurse, doctor or pharmacist. Place the container on your work surface. \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly \n\u2022 Remove one box containing, one syringe, one vial adapter, one vial, two alcohol pads and one \n\nneedle from the carton. If there is a second box in the carton for a future injection, place it back \nin the refrigerator immediately. \n\n\u2022 Look at the expiry date on the box to be used. DO NOT use any item after the date shown on \nthe box. \n\n\u2022 Set up the following items on a clean surface, DO NOT take them out of their individual \npackaging yet. \n\n \no 1) One 1 ml syringe \n\n\n\n163 \n\no 2) One vial adapter  \no 3) One vial for paediatric use of Imraldi for injection \no 4) Two alcohol swabs  \no 5) One needle \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Imraldi is a liquid that is clear and colourless. DO NOT use if the liquid is not clear or not free \n\nof particles. \n \n2)  Preparing the Imraldi dose for injection \n \nGeneral handling: DO NOT dispose of any waste items until after the injection is completed. \n \n\u2022 Prepare the needle by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to the yellow \n\nsyringe connector. Peel the package just far enough to expose the yellow syringe connector.  \nSet the package down with the clear side of the package facing up. \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pop off the white plastic cap from the vial to see the top of the vial stopper. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Use one of the alcohol pads to wipe the vial stopper. DO NOT touch the vial stopper after \n\nwiping with the alcohol pad. \n\n\n\n164 \n\n\u2022 Peel the cover off the vial adapter package but do not take out the vial adapter. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Hold the vial with the vial stopper facing up. \n\u2022 With the vial adapter still in the clear package, attach it to the vial stopper by pushing down \n\nuntil the vial adapter snaps in place. \n\u2022 When you are sure the adapter is attached to the vial, lift off the package from the vial adapter.  \n\u2022 Gently set the vial with vial adapter down on your clean work surface. Be careful that it does \n\nnot fall over. DO NOT touch the vial adapter.  \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Prepare the syringe by partially peeling the package open from the end closest to white plunger \n\nrod. \n\u2022 Peel the clear package just far enough to expose the white plunger rod, but do not take the \n\nsyringe out of the package. \n\u2022 Hold the syringe package and SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the \n\nprescribed dose (For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod to 0.6 \nml). NEVER pull past the 0.9 ml position regardless of prescribed dose. \n\n\u2022 You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in a later step. \n\u2022 DO NOT pull the white plunger rod completely out of the syringe. \n \nNOTE:  \n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nImraldi provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDose + 0.1 ml \n\n \n\u2022 DO NOT use the white plunger rod to remove the syringe from the package. Hold the syringe \n\non the graduated area and pull the syringe from its package. DO NOT set the syringe down at \nany time. \n\n\u2022 While holding the vial adapter firmly, insert the syringe tip into the vial adapter and twist the \nsyringe clockwise with one hand until firm. DO NOT over-tighten.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022 While holding the vial, push the white plunger rod all the way down. This step is important to \n\nget the proper dose. Hold the white plunger rod in and turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose. This is \n\nimportant to get the proper dose. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4 (Dose \nPreparation). If the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod out to 0.6 ml. You will \nsee the liquid medication from the vial go into the syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n166 \n\n \n \n\u2022 Push the white plunger rod all the way back in to push the liquid medication back into the vial. \n\nAgain, SLOWLY pull the white plunger rod out to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose, this is \nimportant to get the proper dose and important in order to prevent air bubbles or air gaps in the \nliquid medication. You will set the volume to the prescribed dose in step 4 (Dose Preparation). \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022 If you see remaining air bubbles or air gaps in the liquid medication in the syringe, you may \n\nrepeat this process up to 3 times. DO NOT shake the syringe. \n \nNOTE:  \n \nIf the white plunger rod is pulled completely out of the syringe, discard the syringe and contact your \nImraldi provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the white plunger rod. \n \n\u2022 While still holding the syringe upright at the graduated area, remove the vial adapter with the \n\nvial by twisting the vial adapter off with the other hand. Be sure to remove the vial adapter with \nthe vial from the syringe. DO NOT touch the tip of the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022 If a large air bubble or air gap can be seen near the syringe tip, SLOWLY push the white \n\nplunger rod into the syringe until fluid begins to enter the syringe tip. DO NOT push the white \nplunger rod past the dose position. \n\n\n\n167 \n\n\u2022 For example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, DO NOT push the white plunger rod past the 0.5 \nml position. \n\n\u2022 Check to see that the fluid remaining in the syringe is at least the prescribed dose volume. If the \nremaining volume is less than the prescribed dose volume, DO NOT use the syringe and \ncontact your healthcare provider. \n\n\u2022 With your free hand, pick up the needle package with the yellow syringe connector facing down. \n\u2022 Keeping the syringe up, insert the syringe tip into the yellow syringe connector and twist the \n\nsyringe as indicated by the arrow in the picture until firm. The needle is now attached to the \nsyringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull the needle package off, but DO NOT remove the clear needle cap. \n\u2022 Place the syringe on your clean work surface. Continue with injection site and dose preparation \n\nimmediately. \n \n3)  Choosing and preparing an injection site \n \n\u2022 Choose a site on your thigh or abdomen (except the area around the navel). DO NOT use the \n\nsame site that was used for the last injection. \n\u2022 The new injection site should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 DO NOT inject in an area where the skin is sore, bruised, scarred, scaly, or has red patches. \n\nThis may mean there is an infection and therefore you should contact your doctor. \n\u2022 To reduce the chance of infection, wipe the injection site with the other alcohol pad. DO NOT \n\ntouch the area again before injecting. \n \n4)  Dose Preparation  \n \n\u2022 Pick up the syringe with the needle pointing up. \n\u2022 Use your other hand to flip the pink needle cover down toward the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n168 \n\n \n \n\u2022 Remove the clear needle cap by pulling it straight up with your other hand. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 The needle is clean. \n\u2022 DO NOT touch the needle. \n\u2022 DO NOT set the syringe down at any time after the clear needle cap is off. \n\u2022 DO NOT try to put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n\u2022 Hold the syringe at eye-level with the needle pointing up to see the amount clearly. Be careful \n\nnot to squirt the liquid medication into your eye. \n\u2022 Recheck the prescribed medication amount. \n\u2022 Push the white plunger rod gently into the syringe until the syringe contains the prescribed \n\namount of liquid. Excess liquid may come out of the needle while the white plunger rod is being \npushed. DO NOT wipe off the needle or the syringe. \n\n \n5)  Injecting Imraldi \n \n\u2022 With the free hand, gently grasp the cleaned area of skin and hold firmly.  \n\u2022 With the other hand, hold syringe at 45-degree angle to skin.  \n\u2022 With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin. \n\u2022 Let go of the skin in your hand. \n\u2022 Push the white plunger rod to inject the liquid medication until the syringe is empty. \n\u2022 When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to pull it out at the same \n\nangle as when it was inserted. \n \n\n\n\n169 \n\n \n \n\u2022 Gently flip the pink needle cover up, over the needle and snap into place and set the syringe \n\nwith needle on the work surface. DO NOT put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Using a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds. A little bleeding \n\nmay occur. DO NOT rub the injection site. Use a plaster if you want to.  \n \n6)  Throwing away supplies \n \n\u2022 You will need a special container for waste, such as a sharps container or as instructed by your \n\nnurse, doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 Put the syringe with needle, vial and vial adapter into a special sharps container. DO NOT put \n\nthese items into regular household waste. \n\u2022 The syringe, needle, vial and vial adapter MUST NEVER be reused. \n\u2022 Keep the special container out of the sight and reach of children at all times. \n\u2022 Throw away all other used items into your regular household waste. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

temporary discontinuation of imraldi. tuberculosis as cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with imraldi, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting imraldi. this will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). the conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your patient reminder card. it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. travel/recurrent infection tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. hepatitis b virus tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis b virus (hbv), if you have active hbv infection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting hbv. your doctor should test you for hbv. imraldi can reactivate hbv infection in people who carry this virus. in some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hbv infection can be life-threatening. age over 65 years if you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking imraldi. you and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with imraldi. it is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. surgery or dental procedure 115 if you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking imraldi. your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of imraldi. demyelinating disease if you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive imraldi. tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. vaccine certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, and these vaccines should not be given while receiving imraldi. check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. it is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with imraldi. if you receive imraldi while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your imraldi use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. heart failure if you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with imraldi, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. it is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. if you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. your doctor will decide if you should receive imraldi. fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale in some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or help you to stop bleeding. if you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. your doctor may decide to stop treatment. cancer there have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking imraldi or other tnf\u03b1 blockers. people with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). if you take imraldi the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. on rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking imraldi. some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with imraldi. in addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking imraldi. if new areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. there have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) treated with another tnf\u03b1 blocker. if you have copd, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a tnf\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. lupus-like syndrome 116 on rare occasions, treatment with imraldi could result in lupus-like syndrome. contact your doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. children and adolescents do not give imraldi to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. other medicines and imraldi tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. imraldi can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). you should not take imraldi with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. if you have questions, please ask your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding you should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last imraldi injection. if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice about taking this medicine. imraldi should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. according to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive adalimumab. imraldi can be used during breast-feeding. if you received imraldi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your imraldi use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see the \"warnings and precautions\" section). driving and using machines imraldi may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. room spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking imraldi. imraldi contains sodium and sorbitol this medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. also this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "imraldi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 6, "BeginOffset":
