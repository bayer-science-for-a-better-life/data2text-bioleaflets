NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nMozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne ml of solution contains 20 mg plerixafor. \n\nEach vial contains 24 mg plerixafor in 1.2 ml solution. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect: \n\nEach ml contains approximately 5 mg (0.2 mmol) of sodium. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution, with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and an osmolality of \n\n260 - 320 mOsm/kg. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAdult patients \n\nMozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance \n\nmobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent \n\nautologous transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise \n\npoorly (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years)  \n\nMozobil is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells \n\nto the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with \n\nlymphoma or solid malignant tumours, either: \n\n- pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after \nadequate mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be \n\ninsufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or \n\n- who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells (see section 4.2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nMozobil therapy should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in oncology and/or \n\nhaematology. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an \n\noncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of \n\nhaematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed. \n\n \n\nAge over 60 and/ or prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy and/or extensive prior chemotherapy \n\nand/or a peak circulating stem cell count of less than 20 stem cells/microliter, have been identified as \n\npredictors of poor mobilisation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPosology  \n\nAdult \n\nThe recommended daily dose of plerixafor by subcutaneous injection (SC) is:  \n\n\u2022 20 mg fixed dose or 0.24 mg/kg of body weight for patients weighing \u2264 83 kg (see section \n5.2).  \n\n\u2022 0.24 mg/kg of body weight for patients weighing > 83 kg. \n \n\nPaediatric (1 to less than 18 years) \n\nThe recommended daily dose of plerixafor by subcutaneous injection (SC) is: \n\n\u2022 0.24 mg/kg of body weight (see section 5.1). \n \n\nEach vial of plerixafor is filled to deliver 1.2 ml of 20 mg/ml plerixafor aqueous solution for injection \n\ncontaining 24 mg of plerixafor. \n\nPlerixafor has to be drawn up into a syringe size type which should be selected according to the weight \n\nof the patient. \n\nFor low weight patients, up to 45 kg of body weight, 1 ml syringes for use in infant patients can be \n\nused. This type of syringe has major graduations for 0.1 ml and minor graduations for 0.01 ml and \n\ntherefore is suitable to administer plerixafor, at a dose of 240 \u00b5g/kg, to paediatric patients of at least \n\n9 kg body weight. \n\nFor patients of more than 45 kg, a1 ml or 2 ml syringe with graduations that allow a volume to 0.1 ml \n\nto be measured can be used. \n\n \n\nIt should be administered by subcutaneous injection 6 to 11 hours prior to initiation of each apheresis \n\nfollowing 4 day pre-treatment with G-CSF. In clinical trials, Mozobil has been commonly used for 2 \n\nto 4 (and up to 7) consecutive days. \n\n \n\nThe weight used to calculate the dose of plerixafor should be obtained within 1 week before the first \n\ndose of plerixafor. In clinical studies, the dose of plerixafor has been calculated based on body weight \n\nin patients up to 175% of ideal body weight. Plerixafor dose and treatment of patients weighing more \n\nthan 175% of ideal body weight have not been investigated. Ideal body weight can be determined \n\nusing the following equations:  \n\n \n\nmale (kg):  50 + 2.3  x  ((Height (cm)  x  0.394) \u2013 60); \n\nfemale (kg):  45.5 + 2.3  x  ((Height (cm)  x  0.394) \u2013 60).  \n\n \n\nBased on increasing exposure with increasing body weight, the plerixafor dose should not exceed \n\n40 mg/day. \n\n \n\nRecommended concomitant medicinal products \n\nIn pivotal clinical studies supporting the use of Mozobil, all patients received daily morning doses of \n\n10 \uf06dg/kg G-CSF for 4 consecutive days prior to the first dose of plerixafor and on each morning prior \n\nto apheresis.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPatients with creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by \n\none-third to 0.16 mg/kg/day (see section 5.2). Clinical data with this dose adjustment are limited. \n\nThere is insufficient clinical experience to make alternative posology recommendations for patients \n\nwith a creatinine clearance <20 ml/min, as well as to make posology recommendations for patients on \n\nhaemodialysis. \n\n \n\nBased on increasing exposure with increasing body weight the dose should not exceed 27 mg/day if \n\nthe creatinine clearance is lower than 50 ml/min. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Mozobil in children (1 to less than 18 years) were studied in an open label, \n\nmulticenter, controlled study (see sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (> 65 years old) \n\nNo dose modifications are necessary in elderly patients with normal renal function. Dose adjustment \n\nin elderly patients with creatinine clearance \u2264 50 ml/min is recommended (see Renal impairment \n\nabove). In general, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients due to the greater \n\nfrequency of decreased renal function with advanced age.   \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nMozobil is for subcutaneous injection. Each vial is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nVials should be inspected visually prior to administration and not used if there is particulate matter or \n\ndiscolouration. Since Mozobil is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free formulation, aseptic technique \n\nshould be followed when transferring the contents of the vial to a suitable syringe for subcutaneous \n\nadministration (see section 6.3). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTumour cell mobilisation in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma \n\nWhen Mozobil is used in conjunction with G-CSF for haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in \n\npatients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma\u201a tumour cells may be released from the marrow and \n\nsubsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. Results showed that, in case tumour cells are \n\nmobilised, the number of tumour cells mobilised is not increased upon Mozobil plus G-CSF compared \n\nto G-CSF alone.  \n\n \n\nTumour cell mobilisation in leukaemia patients \n\nIn a compassionate use programme, Mozobil and G-CSF have been administered to patients with \n\nacute myelogenous leukaemia and plasma cell leukaemia. In some instances, these patients \n\nexperienced an increase in the number of circulating leukaemia cells. For the purpose of \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell mobilisation, plerixafor may cause mobilisation of leukaemic cells and \n\nsubsequent contamination of the apheresis product. Therefore, plerixafor is not recommended for \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell mobilisation and harvest in patients with leukaemia. \n\n \n\nHaematological effects \n\nHyperleukocytosis \n\nAdministration of Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF increases circulating leukocytes as well as \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell populations. White blood cell counts should be monitored during Mozobil \n\ntherapy. Clinical judgment should be exercised when administering Mozobil to patients with \n\nperipheral blood neutrophil counts above 50 x 109/L.  \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nThrombocytopenia is a known complication of apheresis and has been observed in patients receiving \n\nMozobil.  Platelet counts should be monitored in all patients receiving Mozobil and undergoing \n\napheresis. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nMozobil has been uncommonly associated with potential systemic reactions related to subcutaneous \n\ninjection such as urticaria, periorbital swelling, dyspnoea, or hypoxia (see section 4.8). Symptoms \n\nresponded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or \n\nresolved spontaneously. Cases of anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nreported from world-wide post-marketing experience. Appropriate precautions should be taken \n\nbecause of the potential for these reactions. \n\n \n\nVasovagal reactions \n\nVasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous \n\ninjections (see section 4.8). Appropriate precautions should be taken because of the potential for these \n\nreactions. \n\n \n\nEffect on the spleen \n\nIn preclinical studies, higher absolute and relative spleen weights associated with extramedullary \n\nhaematopoiesis were observed following prolonged (2 to 4 weeks) daily plerixafor subcutaneous \n\nadministration in rats at doses approximately 4 fold higher than the recommended human dose. \n\n \n\nThe effect of plerixafor on spleen size in patients has not been specifically evaluated in clinical \n\nstudies. Cases of splenic enlargement and/or rupture have been reported following the administration \n\nof Mozobil in conjunction with growth factor G-CSF. Individuals receiving Mozobil in conjunction \n\nwith G-CSF who report left upper abdominal pain and/or scapular or shoulder pain should be \n\nevaluated for splenic integrity.  \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nMozobil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium- free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. In vitro tests showed that plerixafor was not metabolised \n\nby P450 CYP enzymes, did not inhibit or induce P450 CYP enzymes. Plerixafor did not act as a \n\nsubstrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an in vitro study.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies of patients with Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to a \n\nmobilisation regimen of plerixafor and G-CSF did not impact patient safety or CD34+ cell yield. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data on the use of plerixafor in pregnant women. \n\nBased on the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, plerixafor is suggested to cause congenital \n\nmalformations when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown teratogenicity \n\n(see section 5.3). Mozobil should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the \n\nwoman requires treatment with plerixafor.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether plerixafor is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be \n\nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Mozobil. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThe effects of plerixafor on male and female fertility are not known (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nMozobil may influence the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients have experienced \n\ndizziness, fatigue or vasovagal reactions; therefore caution is advised when driving or operating \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nSafety data for Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF in oncology patients with lymphoma and multiple \n\nmyeloma were obtained from 2 placebo-controlled Phase III studies (301 patients) and 10 uncontrolled \n\nPhase II studies (242 patients). Patients were primarily treated with daily doses of 0.24 mg/kg \n\nplerixafor by subcutaneous injection. The exposure to plerixafor in these studies ranged from 1 to \n\n7 consecutive days (median = 2 days). \n\n \n\nIn the two Phase III studies in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients \n\n(AMD3100-3101 and AMD3100-3102, respectively), a total of 301 patients were treated in the \n\nMozobil and G-CSF group and 292 patients were treated in the placebo and G-CSF group. Patients \n\nreceived daily morning doses of G-CSF 10 \uf06dg/kg for 4 days prior to the first dose of plerixafor or \n\nplacebo and on each morning prior to apheresis. Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with \n\nMozobil and G-CSF than placebo and G-CSF and were reported as related in \u22651% of the patients who \n\nreceived Mozobil, during haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation and apheresis and prior to \n\nchemotherapy/ablative treatment in preparation for transplantation are shown in Table 1.  \n\n \n\nFrom chemotherapy/ablative treatment in preparation of transplantation through 12 months \n\npost-transplantation, no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed \n\nacross treatment groups.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. Frequencies are defined according \n\nto the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data).  \n\n \n\nTable 1. Adverse reactions occurring more frequently with Mozobil than placebo and \n\nconsidered related to Mozobil during mobilisation and apheresis in phase III studies \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n \n\nNot known  Splenomegaly, splenic rupture (see section \n\n4.4)** \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nUncommon Allergic reaction* \n\nAnaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic \n\nshock (see section 4.4) ** \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nUncommon Abnormal dreams, nightmares \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Dizziness, headache \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Diarrhoea, nausea \n\nCommon Vomiting, abdominal pain, stomach \n\ndiscomfort, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, \n\nconstipation, flatulence, hypoaesthesia oral, \n\ndry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nCommon Hyperhidrosis, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection and infusion site reactions \n\nCommon Fatigue, malaise \n\n* The frequency of allergic reactions presented is based on adverse reactions that occurred in the oncology studies \n\n(679 patients). Events included one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnoea \n\n(n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). These events were generally mild or moderate and occurred within approximately 30 min \n\nafter Mozobil administration. \n\n** From post-marketing experience \n \n\nThe adverse reactions reported in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma who received \n\nMozobil in the controlled Phase III studies and uncontrolled studies, including a Phase II study of \n\nMozobil as monotherapy for haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation, are similar. No significant \n\ndifferences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed for oncology patients by disease, age, \n\nor gender. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nIn clinical studies, 7 of 679 oncology patients experienced myocardial infarctions after haematopoietic \n\nstem cell mobilisation with plerixafor and G-CSF. All events occurred at least 14 days after last \n\nMozobil administration. Additionally, two female oncology patients in the compassionate use \n\nprogramme experienced myocardial infarction following haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation with \n\nplerixafor and G-CSF. One of these events occurred 4 days after last Mozobil administration. Lack of \n\ntemporal relationship in 8 of 9 patients coupled with the risk profile of patients with myocardial \n\ninfarction does not suggest Mozobil confers an independent risk for myocardial infarction in patients \n\nwho also receive G-CSF. \n\n \n\nHyperleukocytosis \n\nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 109/L or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of \n\napheresis, in 7% patients receiving Mozobil and in 1% patients receiving placebo in the Phase III \n\nstudies. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed. \n\n \n\nVasovagal reactions \n\nIn Mozobil oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced \n\nvasovagal reactions (orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope) following subcutaneous administration \n\nof plerixafor doses \u22640.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of Mozobil \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nIn Mozobil clinical studies of oncology patients, there have been rare reports of severe gastrointestinal \n\nevents, including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. \n\n \n\nParaesthesia \n\nParaesthesia is commonly observed in oncology patients undergoing autologous transplantation \n\nfollowing multiple disease interventions. In the placebo-controlled Phase III studies, the incidence of \n\nparaesthesia was 20.6% and 21.2% in the plerixafor and placebo groups, respectively. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nIn the two placebo-controlled clinical studies of plerixafor, 24% of patients were \u2265 65 years old. No \n\nnotable differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed in these elderly patients when \n\ncompared with younger ones. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThirty patients were treated with 0.24 mg/kg of Mozobil in an open label, multicenter, controlled study \n\n(DFI 12860) (see section 5.1). \n\nThe safety profile in this paediatric study was consistent with what has been observed in adults. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. Based on limited data at doses above the recommended dose \n\nand up to 0.48 mg/kg the frequency of gastrointestinal disorders, vasovagal reactions, orthostatic \n\nhypotension, and/or syncope may be higher. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunostimulants; ATC code: L03AX16 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nPlerixafor is a bicyclam derivative, a selective reversible antagonist of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor \n\nand blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1\uf061 (SDF-1\uf061), also known as \n\nCXCL12. Plerixafor-induced leukocytosis and elevations in circulating haematopoietic progenitor cell \n\nlevels are thought to result from a disruption of CXCR4 binding to its cognate ligand, resulting in the \n\nappearance of both mature and pluripotent cells in the systemic circulation. CD34+ cells mobilised by \n\nplerixafor are functional and capable of engraftment with long-term repopulating capacity. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn pharmacodynamic studies in healthy volunteers of plerixafor alone, peak mobilisation of CD34+ \n\ncells was observed from 6 to 9 hours after administration. In pharmacodynamic studies in healthy \n\nvolunteers of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF administered at identical dose regimen to that in \n\nstudies in patients, a sustained elevation in the peripheral blood CD34+ count was observed from 4 to \n\n18 hours after plerixafor administration with peak response between 10 and 14 hours. \n\n \n\nIn order to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor following 0.24 mg/kg \n\nbased and fixed (20 mg) doses, a trial was conducted in adult patients with NHL (N=61) who were \n\ntreated with 0.24 mg/kg or 20 mg of plerixafor. The trial was conducted in patients weighing 70 kg or \n\nless (median: 63.7 kg , min: 34.2 kg, max: 70 kg). The fixed 20 mg dose showed 1.43-fold higher \n\nexposure (AUC0-10h) than the 0.24 mg/kg dose (Table 2). The fixed 20 mg dose also showed \n\nnumerically higher response rate (5.2% [60.0% vs 54.8%] based on the local lab data and 11.7% \n\n[63.3% vs 51.6%] based on the central lab data) in attaining the target of \u2265 5 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg \n\nthan the mg/kg-based dose. The median time to reach \u2265 5 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg was 3 days for both \n\ntreatment groups, and the safety profile between the groups was similar. Body weight of 83 kg was \n\nselected as the cut-off point to transition patients from fixed to weight based dosing (83 kg x 0.24 mg \n\n= 19.92 mg/kg). \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Patients \n\nreceived daily morning doses of G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/kg for 4 days prior to the first dose of plerixafor or \n\nplacebo and on each morning prior to apheresis. Optimal (5 or 6 x 106 cells/kg) and minimal \n\n(2 x 106 cells/kg) numbers of CD34+ cells/kg within a given number of days, as well as the primary \n\ncomposite endpoints which incorporated successful engraftment are presented in Tables 3 and 5; the \n\nproportion of patients reaching optimal numbers of CD34+ cells/kg by apheresis day are presented in \n\nTables 4 and 6. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Of these \n\npatients, 55 % (34 out of 62) mobilised \u2265 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had successful engraftment. In \n\nstudy AMD3100-3102, 7 patients (all from the placebo + G-CSF group) entered the Rescue procedure. \n\nOf these patients, 100% (7 out of 7) mobilised \u2265 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had successful \n\nengraftment. \n\n \n\nThe dose of haematopoietic stem cells used for each transplant was determined by the investigator and \n\nall haematopoietic stem cells that were collected were not necessarily transplanted. For transplanted \n\npatients in the Phase III studies, median time to neutrophil engraftment (10-11 days), median time to \n\nplatelet engraftment (18-20 days) and graft durability up to 12 months post-transplantation were \n\nsimilar across the Mozobil and placebo groups. \n\n \n\nMobilisation and engraftment data from supportive Phase II studies (plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg dosed on \n\nthe evening or morning prior to apheresis) in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s \n\ndisease, or multiple myeloma were similar to those data for the Phase III studies. \n\n \n\nIn the placebo-controlled studies, fold increase in peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (cells/\uf06dl) over \n\nthe 24-hour period from the day prior to the first apheresis to just before the first apheresis was \n\nevaluated (Table 7). During that 24-hour period, the first dose of plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg or placebo was \n\nadministered 10-11 hours prior to apheresis. \n\n \n\nTable 7.

Median age was 5.3 years (min: max 1:18) in the Mozobil arm versus 4.7 years \n\n(min:max 1:17) in the control arm. \n\nOnly one patient aged less than 2 years old was randomized to the plerixafor treatment arm. There was \n\nan imbalance between treatment arms in peripheral blood CD34+ counts on the day prior to first \n\napheresis (i.e. prior to administration of plerixafor), with less circulating PB CD34+ in the plerixafor \n\narm. The median PB CD34+ cell counts at baseline were 15 cells/\u00b5l in the Mozobil arm versus \n\n35 cells/\u00b5l in control arm. The primary analysis showed that 80% of patients in the Mozobil arm \n\nexperienced at least a doubling of the PB CD34+ count, observed from the morning of the day \n\npreceding the first planned apheresis to the morning prior to apheresis, versus, 28.6 % of patients in \n\nthe control arm (p=0.0019). The median increase in PB CD34+ cell counts from baseline to the day of \n\napheresis was by 3.2 fold in the Mozobil arm versus by 1.4 fold in the control arm. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of plerixafor have been evaluated in lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients \n\nat the clinical dose level of 0.24 mg/kg following pre-treatment with G-CSF (10 \uf06dg/kg once daily for \n\n4 consecutive days). \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nPlerixafor is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, reaching peak concentrations in \n\napproximately 30-60 minutes (tmax). Following subcutaneous administration of a 0.24 mg/kg dose to \n\npatients after receiving 4-days of G-CSF pre-treatment, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and \n\nsystemic exposure (AUC0-24) of plerixafor were 887 \u00b1 217 ng/ml and 4337 \u00b1 922 ng\u00b7hr/ml, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nPlerixafor is moderately bound to human plasma proteins up to 58%. The apparent volume of \n\ndistribution of plerixafor in humans is 0.3 l/kg demonstrating that plerixafor is largely confined to, but \n\nnot limited to, the extravascular fluid space.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nPlerixafor is not metabolised in vitro using human liver microsomes or human primary hepatocytes \n\nand does not exhibit inhibitory activity in vitro towards the major drug-metabolising CYP450 enzymes \n\n(1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5). In in vitro studies with human hepatocytes, \n\nplerixafor does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 enzymes. These findings suggest that \n\nplerixafor has a low potential for involvement in P450-dependent drug-drug interactions. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe major route of elimination of plerixafor is urinary. Following a 0.24 mg/kg dose in healthy \n\nvolunteers with normal renal function, approximately 70% of the dose was excreted unchanged in \n\nurine during the first 24 hours following administration. The elimination half-life (t1/2) in plasma is \n\n3-5 hours. Plerixafor did not act as a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an in vitro study with \n\nMDCKII and MDCKII-MDR1 cell models. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nFollowing a single dose of 0.24 mg/kg plerixafor, clearance was reduced in subjects with varying \n\ndegrees of renal impairment and was positively correlated with creatinine clearance (CrCl). Mean \n\nvalues of AUC0-24 of plerixafor in subjects with mild (CrCl 51-80 ml/min), moderate \n\n(CrCl 31-50 ml/min) and severe (CrCl \u2264 30 ml/min) renal impairment were 5410, 6780, and \n\n6990 ng.hr/ml, respectively, which were higher than the exposure observed in healthy subjects with \n\nnormal renal function (5070 ng\u00b7hr/ml). Renal impairment had no effect on Cmax.. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect of gender on pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect of age on pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were evaluated in 48 paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) \n\nwith solid tumours at subcutaneous doses of 0.16, 0.24 and 0.32 mg/kg with standard mobilisation (G-\n\nCSF plus or minus chemotherapy). Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and similar to \n\nadults, \u00b5g/kg-based dosage results in increase in plerixafor exposure with increasing body weight in \n\npaediatric patients. At the same weight-based dosing regimen of 240 \u00b5g/kg, the plerixafor mean \n\nexposure (AUC0-24h) is lower in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years (1410 ng.h/mL), 6 to <12 years \n\n(2318 ng.h/mL), and 12 to <18 years (2981 ng.h/mL) than in adults (4337 ng.h/mL). Based on \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic modeling, the plerixafor mean exposures (AUC0-24h) in paediatric patients \n\naged 2 to <6 years (1905 ng.h/mL), 6 to <12 years (3063 ng.h/mL), and 12 to <18 years (4015  \n\nng.h/mL), at the dose of 320 \u00b5g/kg are closer to the exposure in adults receiving 240 \u00b5g/kg.  \n\nHowever, mobilization of PB CD34+ count was observed in stage 2 of the trial. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nThe results from single dose subcutaneous studies in rats and mice showed plerixafor can induce \n\ntransient but severe neuromuscular effects (uncoordinated movement), sedative-like effects \n\n(hypoactivity), dyspnoea, ventral or lateral recumbency, and/or muscle spasms. Additional effects of \n\nplerixafor consistently noted in repeated dose animal studies included increased levels of circulating \n\nwhite blood cells and increased urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium in rats and dogs, slightly \n\nhigher spleen weights in rats, and diarrhoea and tachycardia in dogs. Histopathology findings of \n\nextramedullary haematopoiesis were observed in the liver and spleen of rats and/or dogs. One or more \n\nof these findings were usually observed at systemic exposures in the same order of magnitude or \n\nslightly higher than the human clinical exposure.  \n\n \n\nThe results of the dose range-finding study in juvenile miniature pigs and the range-finding and \n\ndefinitive studies in juvenile rats were similar to those observed in adult mice, rats, and dogs. \n\nExposure margins in the juvenile rat study at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were \u226518 fold when \n\ncompared with the highest clinical paediatric dose in children up to 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nAn in vitro general receptor activity screen showed that plerixafor, at a concentration (5 \u00b5g/ml) several \n\nfold higher than the maximum human systemic level, has moderate or strong binding affinity for a \n\nnumber of different receptors predominantly located on pre-synaptic nerve endings in the central \n\nnervous system (CNS) and/or the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (N-type calcium channel, \n\npotassium channel SKCA, histamine H3, acetylcholine muscarinic M1 and M2, adrenergic \u03b11B and \u03b12C, \n\nneuropeptide Y/Y1 and glutamate NMDA polyamine receptors). The clinical relevance of these \n\nfindings is not known. \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with intravenously administered plerixafor in rats showed respiratory and \n\ncardiac depressant effects at systemic exposure slightly above the human clinical exposure, whilst \n\nsubcutaneous administration elicited respiratory and cardiovascular effects only at higher systemic \n\nlevels. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nSDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 play major roles in embryo-foetal development. Plerixafor has been shown to \n\ncause increased resorptions, decreased foetal weights, retarded skeletal development and increased \n\nfoetal abnormalities in rats and rabbits. Data from animal models also suggest modulation of foetal \n\nhaematopoiesis, vascularisation, and cerebellar development by SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4. Systemic \n\nexposure at No Observed Adverse Effect Level for teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits was of the \n\nsame magnitude or lower as found at therapeutic doses in patients. This teratogenic potential is likely \n\ndue to its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. \n\nIn rat distribution studies concentrations of radiolabelled plerixafor was detected in reproductive \n\norgans (testes, ovaria, uterus) two weeks after single or 7 daily repeated doses in males and after \n\n7 daily repeated doses in females. The elimination rate from tissues was slow. \n\nThe potential effects of plerixafor on male fertility and postnatal development have not been evaluated \n\nin non-clinical studies. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies with plerixafor have not been conducted. Plerixafor was not genotoxic in an \n\nadequate battery of genotoxicity tests. \n\n \n\nPlerixafor inhibited tumour growth in in vivo models of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, glioblastoma, \n\nmedulloblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when dosed intermittently. An increase of non-\n\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma growth was noted after a continuous administration of plerixafor for 28 days. \n\nThe potential risk associated with this effect is expected to be low for the intended short term duration \n\nof dosing plerixafor in humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n  \n\n1. What Mozobil is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Mozobil \n\n3. How to use Mozobil \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5.  How to store Mozobil \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Mozobil is and what it is used for \n \n\nMozobil contains the active substance plerixafor which blocks a protein on the surface of blood stem \n\ncells. This protein \u201cties\u201d blood stem cells to the bone marrow. Plerixafor improves the release of stem \n\ncells into the blood stream (mobilisation). The stem cells can then be collected by a machine that \n\nseparates blood constituents (apheresis machine), and subsequently frozen and stored until your \n\ntransplant. \n\n \n\nIf mobilisation is poor, Mozobil is used to help collect blood stem cells from the patient, for collection, \n\nstorage and reintroduction (transplantation), \n\n\u2022 In adults who have lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells) or multiple myeloma (a cancer \nthat affects plasma cells in the bone marrow). \n\n\u2022 In children age 1 to less than 18 years of age with lymphoma or solid tumours.  \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Mozobil \n \n\nDo not use Mozobil \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to plerixafor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Mozobil. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor:  \n\n\u2022 if you have or have had any heart problems. \n\n\u2022 if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may adjust the dose. \n\n\u2022 if you have high white blood cell counts.  \n\n\u2022 if you have low platelet counts. \n\n\u2022 if you have a history of feeling faint or lightheaded on standing or sitting or have fainted before \n\nupon injections. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nYour doctor may perform regular blood tests to monitor your blood cell count. \n\n \n\nIt is not recommended to use Mozobil for stem cell mobilisation if you have leukaemia (a cancer of \n\nthe blood or bone marrow). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Mozobil \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nYou should not use Mozobil if you are pregnant, since there is no experience with Mozobil in pregnant \n\nwomen. It is important to tell your doctor if you are, think you may be or are planning to become \n\npregnant. It is recommended to use contraception if you are of child-bearing age. \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed if you are using Mozobil, since it is not known if Mozobil is excreted in \n\nhuman milk.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nMozobil may cause dizziness and fatigue. Therefore, you should avoid driving if you feel dizzy, tired \n\nor unwell. \n\n \n\nMozobil contains sodium  \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Mozobil \n \n\nYour medicine will be injected by a doctor or a nurse.  \n\n \n\nYou will first receive G-CSF, then you will be given Mozobil \n\nMobilisation will be started by first giving you another medicine called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony \n\nstimulating factor). G-CSF will help Mozobil to work properly in your body. If you want to know \n\nmore about G-CSF ask your doctor and read the corresponding package leaflet. \n\n \n\nHow much Mozobil is given? \n\nThe recommended adult dose is either a 20 mg (fixed dose) or 0.24 mg/kg body weight/day.  \n\nThe recommended dose for children, 1 to less than 18 years of age is 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day.  \n\n \n\nYour dose will depend on your body weight, which should be measured the week before you receive \n\nyour first dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney problems, your doctor will reduce the dose.  \n\n \n\nHow is Mozobil given? \n\nMozobil is given by subcutaneous injection (under your skin). \n\n \n\nWhen is Mozobil given for the first time? \n\nYou will receive your first dose 6 to 11 hours before apheresis (collection of your blood stem cells). \n\n \n\nHow long will Mozobil be given? \n\nTreatment lasts 2 to 4 consecutive days (in some cases up to 7 days), until enough stem cells have \n\nbeen collected for your transplant. In a few cases, enough stem cells may not be collected, and the \n\ncollection attempt will be stopped. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately if \n\n\u2022 shortly after receiving Mozobil, you experience rash, swelling around the eyes, shortness of \n\nbreath or lack of oxygen, feeling lightheaded on standing or sitting, feeling faint or fainting \n\n\u2022 you have pain in the upper left abdomen (belly) or your left shoulder \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), injection site redness or irritation \n\n\u2022 low red blood cell count by laboratory test (anaemia in children) \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\u2022 headache  \n\n\u2022 dizziness, feeling tired or unwell  \n\n\u2022 difficulty in sleeping \n\n\u2022 flatulence, constipation, indigestion, vomiting  \n\n\u2022 stomach symptoms such as pain, swelling or discomfort  \n\n\u2022 dry mouth, numbness around the mouth  \n\n\u2022 sweating, generalised redness of the skin, joint pains, pains in muscles and bones \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n\u2022 allergic reactions such as skin rash, swelling around the eyes, shortness of breath \n\n\u2022 anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock \n\n\u2022 abnormal dreams, nightmares \n \n\nRarely, gastrointestinal side effects may be severe (diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain and nausea). \n\n \n\nHeart attacks \n\nIn clinical trials, patients with risk factors for a heart attack uncommonly suffered heart attacks after \n\nbeing given Mozobil and G-CSF. Please inform your doctor immediately if you experience chest \n\ndiscomfort. \n\n \n\nPins and needles and numbness \n\nPins and needles and numbness are common in patients being treated for cancers. About one in five \n\npatients suffered from these feelings. However, these effects do not seem to occur more frequently \n\nwhen you use Mozobil. \n\nYou may also have an increase in white blood cells count (leucocytosis), in your blood tests. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Mozobil \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial. \n\n \n\nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n\n \n\nAfter opening the vial, Mozobil should be used immediately. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

the recommended dose for children, 1 to less than 18 years of age is 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day. your dose will depend on your body weight, which should be measured the week before you receive your first dose. if you have moderate or severe kidney problems, your doctor will reduce the dose. how is mozobil given? mozobil is given by subcutaneous injection (under your skin). when is mozobil given for the first time? you will receive your first dose 6 to 11 hours before apheresis (collection of your blood stem cells). how long will mozobil be given? treatment lasts 2 to 4 consecutive days (in
