QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg \nmemantine.\nEach film-coated tablet contains 20 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 16.62 mg \nmemantine.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\n\nEbixa 10 mg film-coated tablets\nPale yellow to yellow, oval shaped film-coated tablets with breaking line and imprint \u201c1 0\u201d on one \nside and \u201cM M\u201d on the other side. The tablet can be divided into equal doses.\n\nEbixa 20 mg film-coated tablets\nPale red to grey-red, oval-oblong film-coated tablets with imprint \u201c20\u201d on one side and \u201cMEM\u201d on the \nother side\n\n4. Clinical particulars\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\n\nPosology\n\nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient\u2019s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment.\n\nAdults:\n\nDose titration\nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects, the \nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows:\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n3\n\nWeek 1 (day 1-7)\nThe patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days.\n\nWeek 2 (day 8-14)\nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days.\n\nWeek 3 (day 15-21):\nThe patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablets (15 mg) per day for 7 days.\n\nFrom Week 4 on:\nThe patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) or one 20 mg film-coated tablet per day.\n\nMaintenance dose\nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day.\n\nElderly\nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day (two 10 mg film-coated tablets or one 20 mg film-coated tablet once a day) as described \nabove.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 \u2013 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013\n49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day.  If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the \n\ndose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 \u2013 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no \ndose adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are available. Administration of Ebixa is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data available. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nEbixa should be administered orally once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. The \nfilm-coated tablets can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy.\n\nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5).\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n4\n\nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 \u201cElimination\u201d) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n\nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur:\n\n\uf0b7 The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary.\n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin.\n\n\uf0b7 Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels.\n\n\uf0b7 There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT.\n\n\uf0b7 In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants.\n\nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed.\n\nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed.\n\nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women. Animal studies \nindicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nMemantine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed.\n\nFertility\nNo adverse reactions of memantine were noted on male and female fertility.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nModerate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Ebixa has minor to moderate influence on the \nability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Ebixa and 1,595 \npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Ebixa did not differ \nfrom those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Ebixa group than in the placebo \ngroup were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs \n2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Ebixa and since its introduction in the market. \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to < \n1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n6\n\nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION\n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections\n\nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity\n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence\n\nUncommon Confusion\n\nUncommon Hallucinations1\n\nNot known Psychotic reactions2\n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness\n\nCommon Balance disorders\n\nUncommon Gait abnormal\n\nVery rare Seizures\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure\n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension\n\nUncommon Venous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nCommon Dyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation\n\nUncommon Vomiting\n\nNot known Pancreatitis2\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test\n\nNot known Hepatitis\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Headache\n\nUncommon Fatigue\n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with Ebixa.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is\nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. \nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience.\n\nSymptoms\nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea).\n\nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae.\n\nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness.\n\nTreatment\nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate.\n\nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics. Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n\nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia.\n\nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction.\n\nClinical studies\nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician\u00b4s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study \u2013 activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002).\n\nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n8\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \n(last observation carried forward (LOCF)). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24.\n\nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np\uf03c0.0001).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine.\n\nDistribution\nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 \u00b5mol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins.\n\nBiotransformation \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound.\nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 6-hydroxy-\nmemantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-\nantagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro.\n\nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally.\n\nElimination\nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t\u00bd of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n\nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers.\n\nLinearity\nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 \u00b5mol in human frontal cortex.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n9\n\nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n\nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes.\n\nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown.\n\nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral solution.\nThe solution is clear and colourless to light yellowish.\n\n4. Clinical particulars\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\n\nPosology\n\nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient\u2019s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment.\n\nAdults\n\nDose titration\nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg once daily. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects, the\nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows:\n\nWeek 1 (day 1-7)\nThe patient should take 0.5 ml solution (5 mg) equivalent to one pump actuation per day for 7 days.\n\nWeek 2 (day 8-14)\nThe patient should take 1 ml solution (10 mg) equivalent to two pump actuations per day for 7 days.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n12\n\nWeek 3 (day 15-21)\nThe patient should take 1.5 ml solution (15 mg) equivalent to three pump actuations per day for 7 days.\n\nFrom Week 4 on\nThe patient should take 2 ml solution (20 mg) equivalent to four pump actuations once a day.\n\nMaintenance dose\nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day.\n\nElderly\nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day (2 ml solution, equivalent to four pump actuations) as described above.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 \u2013 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013\n49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations). If \n\ntolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according \nto standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 \u2013\n29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations) per day. \n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no \ndose adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are available. Administration of Ebixa is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEbixa should be taken orally once daily at the same time each day. The solution can be taken with or\nwithout food. The solution must not be poured or pumped into the mouth directly from the bottle or \nthe pump, but should be dosed onto a spoon or into a glass of water using the pump. \n\nFor detailed instructions on the preparation and handling of the product see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy.\n\nConcomitant use of other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine \nor dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5).\n\nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 \u201cElimination\u201d) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised.\n\nExcipients: The oral solution contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicine. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur:\n\n\uf0b7 The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary.\n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin.\n\n\uf0b7 Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels.\n\n\uf0b7 There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT.\n\n\uf0b7 In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants.\n\nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed.\n\nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed.\n\nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women. Animal studies \nindicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nMemantine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed.\n\nFertility\nNo adverse reactions of memantine were noted on male and female fertility.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n14\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nModerate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Ebixa has minor or moderate influence on the \nability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Ebixa and 1,595 \npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Ebixa did not differ \nfrom those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Ebixa group than in the placebo \ngroup were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs \n2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Ebixa and since its introduction in the market. \n\nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n15\n\nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION\n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections\n\nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity\n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence\n\nUncommon Confusion\n\nUncommon Hallucinations1\n\nNot known Psychotic reactions2\n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness\n\nCommon Balance disorders\n\nUncommon Gait abnormal\n\nVery rare Seizures\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure\n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension\n\nUncommon Venous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nCommon Dyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation\n\nUncommon Vomiting\n\nNot known Pancreatitis2\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test\n\nNot known Hepatitis\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Headache\n\nUncommon Fatigue\n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with Ebixa.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is\nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. \nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience.\n\nSymptoms\nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination and gait disturbance) \nand/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea).\n\nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae.\n\nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness.\n\nTreatment\nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate.\n\nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics. Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia.\n\nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction.\n\nClinical studies \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician\u2019s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study \u2013 activities of the \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002).\n\nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n17\n\na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \n(last observation carried forward (LOCF)). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24.\n\nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np\uf03c0.0001).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine.\n\nDistribution \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 \u00b5mol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 6-hydroxy-\nmemantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-\nantagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro.\n\nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally.\n\nElimination \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t\u00bd of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n\nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers.\n\nLinearity \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant)\nof memantine, which is 0.5 \u00b5mol in human frontal cortex.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n18\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n\nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes.\n\nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown.\n\nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure.\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nPotassium sorbate\nSorbitol E420\nPurified water\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nNot applicable.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n4 years.\nOnce opened, the contents of the bottle should be used within 3 months.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nDo not store above 30\u00baC.\n\nThe bottle with the mounted pump may only be kept and transported in a vertical position.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n50 ml (and 10 x 50 ml) in brown glass bottles (Hydrolytic Class II) and 100 ml in brown glass bottles \n(Hydrolytic Class III).\n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n19\n\nNo special requirements.\n\nPrior to first use the dosing pump has to be screwed on the bottle. For removing the screw cap from \nthe bottle the cap must be turned anticlockwise and unscrewed completely (fig.1). \n\nMounting the dosing pump on the bottle:\n\nThe dosing pump has to be removed from the plastic bag (fig. 2) and placed on top of the bottle, \nsliding the plastic dip tube carefully into the bottle. Then the dosing pump needs to be held onto the \nneck of the bottle and screwed clockwise until it is firmly attached (fig 3). For the intended use the \ndosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, and should never be unscrewed.\n\nUse of the dosing pump for dispensing:\n\nThe dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn \u2013 anticlockwise (unlocked position) and \nclockwise (locked position). The dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked \nposition. The solution may only be dispensed in the unlocked position. To do this, the dosing pump \nhead has to be turned in the direction of the arrow about one eighth of a turn, until a resistance is felt \n(fig. 4)\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n20\n\nThe dosing pump is then ready for use.\n\nPreparing the dosing pump:\nWhen used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. \nTherefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely \nfive times in succession (fig. 5).\n\nThe solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards \ncompletely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (1 pump actuation is \nequivalent to 0.5 ml oral solution, and contains 5 mg of the active substance memantine hydrochloride; \nfig. 6).\n\nCorrect use of the dosing pump:\n\nThe bottle should be placed on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in a \nvertical position. A glass with a little water or a spoon should be held below the nozzle and the dosing \npump head has to be pushed down in a firm but calm and steady manner (not too slowly) right down to \nthe stop (fig. 7, fig. 8).\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n21\n\nThe dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation.\n\nThe dosing pump may only be used with the memantine hydrochloride solution in the bottle provided, \nnot for other substances or containers. If the pump does not function as described during intended use \nand according to instruction, the patient should consult the treating physician or a pharmacist. The \ndosing pump should be locked after use.\n\n7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER\n\nH. Lundbeck A/S\nOttiliavej 9\n2500 Valby\nDenmark\n\n8.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\n\nPosology\nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient\u2019s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n23\n\nAdults\n\nDose titration\nThe recommended starting dose is 5 mg per day which is stepwise increased over the first 4 weeks of \ntreatment reaching the recommended maintenance dose as follows:\n\nWeek 1 (day 1-7)\nThe patient should take one 5 mg film-coated tablet per day (white to off-white, oval-oblong) for 7 days.\n\nWeek 2 (day 8-14)\nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet per day (pale yellow to yellow, oval shaped) for 7 \ndays.\n\nWeek 3 (day 15-21)\nThe patient should take one 15 mg film-coated tablet per day (grey-orange, oval-oblong) for 7 days.\n\nWeek 4 (day 22-28) \nThe patient should take one 20 mg film-coated tablet per day (grey-red, oval-oblong) for 7 days.\n\nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day.\n\nMaintenance dose\nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day.\n\nElderly\nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day (20 mg once a day) as described above.\n\nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 \u2013 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013\n49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the \n\ndose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 \u2013 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day.\n\nHepatic impairment  \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no \ndose adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are available. Administration of Ebixa is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEbixa should be administered orally once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. The\nfilm-coated tablets can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n24\n\nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5).\n\nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 \u201cElimination\u201d) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n\nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur:\n\n\uf0b7 The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary.\n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The \nsame may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one \npublished case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin.\n\n\uf0b7 Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly \ninteract with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels.\n\n\uf0b7 There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when \nmemantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT.\n\n\uf0b7 In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants.\n\nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance-\nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed.\n\nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics\nof galantamine was observed.\n\nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women.\nAnimal studies indicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are \nidentical or slightly higher than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Memantine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n25\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed.\n\nFertility\nNo adverse reactions of memantine were noted on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nModerate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Ebixa has minor or moderate influence on the \nability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Ebixa and 1,595\npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Ebixa did not differ \nfrom those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Ebixa group than in the placebo \ngroup were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs \n2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith Ebixa and since its introduction in the market. \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to < \n1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n26\n\nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS FREQUENCY ADVERSE REACTION\n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections\n\nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity\n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence\n\nUncommon Confusion\n\nUncommon Hallucinations1\n\nNot known Psychotic reactions2\n\nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness\n\nCommon Balance disorders\n\nUncommon Gait abnormal\n\nVery rare Seizures\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure\n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension\n\nUncommon Venous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nCommon Dyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation\n\nUncommon Vomiting\n\nNot known Pancreatitis2\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Elevated liver function test\n\nNot known Hepatitis\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Headache\n\nUncommon Fatigue\n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with Ebixa.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is \nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.\nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience.\n\nSymptoms\nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea).\n\nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae.\n\nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness.\n\nTreatment \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate.\n\nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics. Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n\nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia.\n\nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction.\n\nClinical studies \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician\u2019s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study \u2013 activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002).\n\nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n28\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24.\n\nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np\uf03c0.0001).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine.\n\nDistribution \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 - 1 \u00b5mol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins.\n\nBiotransformation \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 6-hydroxy-\nmemantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-\nantagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro.\n\nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally.\n\nElimination \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t\u00bd of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion.\n\nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers.\n\nLinearity \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 \u00b5mol in human frontal cortex.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n29\n\nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n\nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes.\n\nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown.\n\nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What Ebixa is and what it is used for\n\nEbixa contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. It belongs to a group of medicines \nknown as anti-dementia medicines.\nMemory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain \ncontains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve \nsignals important in learning and memory. Ebixa belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-\nreceptor antagonists. Ebixa acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve \nsignals and the memory.\n\nEbixa is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ebixa\n\nDo not take Ebixa\n\n- if you are allergic to memantine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in\nsection 6). \n\nWarning and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebixa:\n\n- if you have a history of epileptic seizures\n- if you have recently experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or if you are suffering \n\nfrom congestive heart failure or from an uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\nIn these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Ebixa \nreassessed by your doctor on a regular basis.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n62\n\nIf you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your \nkidney function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly. \n\nIf you are suffering from states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA, an excess of acid-forming substances \nin the blood due to renal dysfunction (poor kidney function)) or severe infections of the urinary tract \n(structure that carries urine), your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your medicine.\n\nThe use of medicinal products called amantadine (for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease), ketamine \n(a substance generally used as an anaesthetic), dextromethorphan (generally used to treat cough) and \nother NMDA-antagonists at the same time should be avoided.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nEbixa is not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Ebixa\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, Ebixa may change the effects of the following medicines and their dose may need to be \nadjusted by your doctor:\n\n- amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan\n- dantrolene, baclofen\n- cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, nicotine\n- hydrochlorothiazide (or any combination with hydrochlorothiazide)\n- anticholinergics (substances generally used to treat movement disorders or intestinal cramps)\n- anticonvulsants (substances used to prevent and relieve seizures)\n- barbiturates (substances generally used to induce sleep)\n- dopaminergic agonists (substances such as L-dopa, bromocriptine)\n- neuroleptics (substances used in the treatment of mental disorders)\n- oral anticoagulants\n\nIf you go into hospital, let your doctor know that you are taking Ebixa.\n\nEbixa with food and drink\n\nYou should inform your doctor if you have recently changed or intend to change your diet \nsubstantially (e.g. from normal diet to strict vegetarian diet), as your doctor may need to adjust the \ndose of your medicine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe use of memantine in pregnant women is not recommended. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nWomen taking Ebixa should not breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n63\n\nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive and to use machines safely.\nAlso, Ebixa may change your reactivity, making driving or operating machinery inappropriate. \n\n3. How to take Ebixa\n\nAlways take Ebixa exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose of Ebixa for adults and older people is 20 mg once a day.

From the fourth week on, the usual dose is 2 tablets once a day (1x 20 mg).\n\nDosage in patients with impaired kidney function\n\nIf you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will decide upon a dose that suits your condition. In \nthis case, monitoring of your kidney function should be performed by your doctor at specified \nintervals.\n\nAdministration\n\nEbixa should be administered orally once a day. To benefit from your medicine you should take it \nregularly every day at the same time of the day. The tablets should be swallowed with some water. \nThe tablets can be taken with or without food.\n\nDuration of treatment\n\nContinue to take Ebixa as long as it is of benefit to you. Your doctor should assess your treatment on a \nregular basis. \n\nIf you take more Ebixa than you should\n\n- In general, taking too much Ebixa should not result in any harm to you. You may experience \nincreased symptoms as described in section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d. \n\n- If you take a large overdose of Ebixa, contact your doctor or get medical advice, as you may \nneed medical attention. \n\nIf you forget to take Ebixa\n\n- If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Ebixa, wait and take your next dose at the \nusual time. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n64\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n4.

What Ebixa is and what it is used for\n\nEbixa contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. It belongs to a group of medicines \nknown as anti-dementia medicines.\n\nMemory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain.

Ebixa belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-\nreceptor antagonists. Ebixa acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve \nsignals and the memory.\n\nEbixa is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n2.

Measure \nthe dose onto a spoon or into a glass of water, using the pump.\n\nTake the screw cap off the bottle:\n\nThe cap must be turned anticlockwise, unscrewed completely and removed (fig. 1).\n\nMounting the dosing pump on the bottle:\n\nTake the dosing pump out of the plastic bag (fig. 2) and place it on top of the bottle. Slide the plastic \ndip tube carefully into the bottle. Hold the dosing pump onto the neck of the bottle and screw it \nclockwise until it fits firmly (fig. 3). The dosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, \nand should never be unscrewed.\n\nHow the dosing pump works:\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n74\n\nThe dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn:\n- anticlockwise to unlock and \n- clockwise to lock.\n\nThe dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked position. The solution may only \nbe dispensed in the unlocked position. To unlock, turn the pump head in the direction of the arrow \nuntil it cannot be turned any further (about one eighth of a turn, fig. 4). The dosing pump is then ready \nfor use.\n\nPreparing the dosing pump:\n\nWhen used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. \nTherefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely \nfive times in succession (fig. 5).\n\nThe solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards \ncompletely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (fig. 6).\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n75\n\nCorrect use of the dosing pump:\n\nPlace the bottle on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in an upright \nposition. Hold a glass with a little water or a spoon below the nozzle. Push down the dosing pump \nhead in a firm but calm and steady manner - not too slowly (fig. 7, fig. 8).\n\nThe dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation.\n\nThe dosing pump must only be used with the Ebixa solution in the bottle provided, not for other \nsubstances or containers. If the pump does not function properly, consult your doctor or a pharmacist. \nLock the dosing pump after using Ebixa.\n\n v.  \n \nREG_002625 37.0\n\n\n\n76\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nEbixa 5 mg film-coated tablets \nEbixa 10 mg film-coated tablets\nEbixa 15 mg film-coated tablets\nEbixa 20 mg film-coated tablets\n\nMemantine hydrochloride          \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n- Keep this leaflet.
