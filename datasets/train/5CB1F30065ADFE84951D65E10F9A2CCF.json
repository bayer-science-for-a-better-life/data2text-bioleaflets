NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nPylobactell, 100 mg, Soluble Tablet \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nActive substance  Quantity per tablet \n\n \n13C-urea   100 mg \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSoluble tablet \n\nA white, biconvex tablet. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.  \n\nFor in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori infection. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPylobactell is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to \n\ninsufficient data on efficacy. \n\n \n\nThe Pylobactell tablet is for oral administration. \n\n \n\nAdults:  The tablet is to be dissolved in water and taken 10 minutes after the start of the breath \n\ntest procedure. \n\n \n\nThe patient should fast for at least 4 hours before the test so that the test is taken on an empty \n\nstomach. If the patient has eaten a heavy meal then it will be necessary to fast for six hours \n\nprior to the test.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to follow the instructions for use described in Section 6.6 adequately, otherwise \n\nthe validity of the test result will be questionable. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nThe test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection that \n\nmight interfere with the urea breath test. \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nA positive urea breath test alone does not clinically confirm that eradication therapy is \n\nindicated.  Alternative diagnosis with invasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\norder to examine the presence of any other complicating conditions, eg. gastric ulcer, \n\nautoimmune gastritis and malignancies. \n\n \n\nIn individual cases of atrophic gastritis, the breath test result may have a false positive \n\noutcome and other tests may be required to confirm the presence of H.pylori. \n\n \n\nIf a repeat test is required, it should not be carried out until the following day. \n\nFor patients who do not tolerate the recommended test meal, an alternative test meal should \n\nbe given.  Care should be taken in patients where fasting may have medical implications. \n\n \n\nThere are insufficient data on the diagnostic reliability of the Pylobactell test to recommend \n\nits use in patients with partial gastrectomy and in patients younger than 18 years. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe validity of the test result may be affected if the patient is currently being treated with \n\nantibiotics or a proton-pump inhibitor or has completed a course of treatment with these \n\ndrugs.  The results may be affected in general by all treatments interfering with H.pylori \n\nstatus or urease activity. \n\n \n\nSuppression of H. pylori might give false negative results. Therefore, the test must not be \n\nused until four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of \n\nacid antisecretory agents. This is especially important after eradication therapy. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nThe endogenous production of urea amounts to 25 - 35 g/day.  It is therefore unlikely that the \n\ndose of 100 mg urea should cause any adverse effect on pregnancy and lactation. \n\n \n\nThe Pylobactell test is not expected to be harmful during pregnancy or to the health of the \n\nfoetus / newborn child. Pylobactell can be used during pregnancy and lactation. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nNone known. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is \n\nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. \n\nHealthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national \n\nreporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdose is unlikely to occur in the intended clinical circumstances. No case of overdose has \n\nbeen reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Other diagnostic agents \n\n \n\nATC code:  V04C X. \n\n \n\nIn the case of infection with H.pylori, orally ingested 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme \n\nurease which is present in H.pylori. \n\n \n\nH2N(13CO)NH2 + H2O \u2192 2NH3 + 13CO2 \n \n\nThe carbon dioxide which is liberated diffuses into the blood vessels and is transported as \n\nbicarbonate to the lungs where it is then liberated as 13CO2 in exhaled air.  Infection with \n\nH.pylori will significantly change the 13C/12C - carbon isotope ratio. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of 13CO2 in the breath samples may be determined by isotope-ratio-mass \n\nspectrometry (IRMS) or by another suitably-validated method carried out by any qualified \n\nlaboratory, and stated as an absolute difference (excess) in the value between the pre-urea and \n\npost-urea breath samples (see Section 6.6). \n\n \n\nThe cut off point for discriminating between H.pylori negative and positive patients is set to \n\nan excess value of 3.5, i.e. <3.5 is negative and \uf0b33.5 is positive. \n\n \n\nIn comparison with biopsy based techniques for diagnosing H.pylori infection, using data \n\nfrom two therapeutic trials, Pylobactell achieved during different conditions (prestudy and \n\nfollow-up visits) sensitivity estimates above 95 % with lower one-sided 95 % confidence limit \n\nranging from 93 % to 98 %. The specificity estimates were all above 90 % with \n\ncorresponding lower confidence limits ranging from 85 % to 90 %.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nUrea is rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and distributed into extracellular and \n\nintracellular fluids including lymph, bile, cerebrospinal fluid and blood.  It is reported to cross \n\nthe placenta and penetrate the eye.  It is excreted unchanged in the urine. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nThere are no concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nPovidone (E1201) \n\nMicrocrystalline Cellulose (E460i)  \n\nColloidal Anhydrous Silica  \n\nSodium Benzoate (E211) \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nNot applicable. \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\n3 years.  The dissolved tablet must be taken immediately. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nDo not store above 25\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\nThe Pylobactell 13C-urea breath test kit contains a sachet containing the Pylobactell tablet, six \n\nglass tubes with caps and bar code labels, three additional bar code labels, a 30 ml mixing and \n\nadministration glass vial with cap, two straws, a package leaflet and an Analysis Request \n\nForm.  A security label for re-sealing the kit is also provided. \n\n \n\nThe Pylobactell breath test procedure includes the administering of a suitable test meal. This \n\nis not supplied within the box. \n\nThe Pylobactell tablet container is a heat-sealed PET/aluminium foil/LDPE laminated sachet. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nThe patient should fast for at least 4 hours before the test so that the test is taken on an empty \n\nstomach. If the patient has eaten a heavy meal then it will be necessary to fast for six hours \n\nprior to the test. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the breath test is performed while the patient is in a seated position. \n\n \n\nSampling instructions \n\n \n\nt = 0 minutes Note the time the patient drinks the test meal. \n\n \n\nt = 5 minutes Collect pre-urea breath samples. Three tubes of breath are to be taken by \n\nbreathing normally through a straw held at the base of a small tube (white top).  The patient \n\nmust expire as the straw is slowly and completely withdrawn from the tube, which is then \n\nimmediately capped.  These breath samples are used to measure the natural level of 13C in the \n\ncarbon dioxide of the breath. \n\n \n\nt = 10 minutes The Pylobactell tablet is placed in the 30 ml mixing vial and water added to \n\nthe marked line. The bottle is capped and shaken well to dissolve the tablet.  The entire \n\ncontents must be swallowed immediately by the patient, the bottle is refilled with water to the \n\nline and the entire contents are again swallowed by the patient. \n\n \n\nt = 40 minutes Collect post-urea (red top) breath samples. Three tubes of breath are to be \n\ntaken, which are used to measure the presence of excess levels of 13C, which will be present if \n\nthe patient is H.pylori positive. \n\n \n\nOn completion of the test retain one pre-urea sample (white top) and one post-urea sample \n\n(red top).  Return two pre-urea and two post-urea samples to the box. Safely discard the 30 ml \n\nmixing vial.  Complete the Analysis Request Form; attach one of three spare bar code labels \n\nto the area marked \"AFFIX BAR CODE LABEL HERE\".  This bar code is the doctor's \n\nreference number used at the analysing laboratory as a patient identifier; the two spare bar \n\ncode labels are for the doctor's use on the patient notes/files etc. \n\n \n\nAfter placing the four sample tubes and paperwork into the box, use the security label \n\nprovided to seal the lid of the box, and send to a qualified laboratory for analysis. \n\n \n\nThe optimal test meal recommended is 200 ml pure undiluted orange juice. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of breath samples and testing specification \n\n \n\nThe accuracy and precision of the test depends heavily on the quality of the analysis and \n\ntherefore only laboratories having appropriate certification are considered qualified to analyse \n\nthe breath samples. \n\n \n\nSatisfactory specificity and sensitivity have been demonstrated in clinical studies where \n\nbreath was analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).  \n\n \n\nBreath samples collected during a test must remain in the original containers before analysis \n\nby IRMS.  \n\n \n\nIRMS instruments may be of continuous flow or dual inlet configuration.  \n\n \n\nA multi-position autosampler and bar code reader should be used to allow samples to be \n\ntracked throughout the analysis. \n\n \n\nIRMS source parameters and tuning must be optimised daily. \n\n \n\nInstruments must be linear over a wide range of CO2 concentrations, typically 1.0 - 6.0%. \n\nThis should be checked routinely. \n\n \n\nInternal analytical precision must be less than + 0.3 \u2030 \uf06413C for 20 replicate analyses of the \n\nsame reference gas sample and remain within 3SD\u2019s of the mean for breath analyses. \n\n \n\nTransfer of the breath sample through the analytical system must be accomplished without \n\nisotope fractionation. \n\n \n\nThe IRMS must possess a triple collector to allow the simultaneous detection of the ions at \n\nmass/charge ratio 44, 45 and 46 fluctuations in the oxygen isotope content. \n\n  \n\nThere must be provision for correction of instrumental drift during an analysis. \n\n \n\nReference gases must be standardised against an appropriate international standard to allow \n\ninter-laboratory comparison of results. \n\n \n\nAlternatively, any other suitably-validated method may be used, carried out by any \n\nobjectively qualified laboratory.  \n\n \n\nExplanation of results:- \n\n \n\n\uf064 13C:- Difference in parts per thousand (\u2030) with respect to an accepted international \n\nstandard. \n\nExcess \uf06413C:- Difference between pre- and post-urea sample measurements. \n\n \n\nH. pylori status: -< 3.5 excess \uf06413C = Negative    \n\n      > 3.5 excess \uf06413C = Positive \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT PYLOBACTELL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \n\nPylobactell is a breath test for determining the presence of the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. \n\npylori) in the gut (stomach and adjacent bowel) which may be the reason for your stomach (gastric) \n\ncondition.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor has recommended that you have a 13C-Urea breath test, for one of the following reasons: \n\n\u2022 Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from H. pylori infection to help diagnose \nyour condition. \n\n\u2022 You have already been diagnosed with H. pylori and have been taking medication aimed to clear \nup the infection. Your doctor now wants to find out if the treatment has worked. \n\n \n\nThis medicine is for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nHow does the test work? \n\nAll foods contain a substance called carbon 13 (13C), in varying amounts. This 13C can be detected in \n\nthe carbon dioxide that you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of 13C in the breath will \n\ndepend on the type of food that you have eaten. \n\n \n\nYou will be asked to drink a \"test meal\". This will help keep the test 13C-urea solution in your \n\nstomach. \n\n \n\nFollowing the meal, 3 samples of your breath will be taken. These samples will be analysed to \n\nmeasure the normal amount of 13C in the carbon dioxide in your breath. \n\n \n\nYou will then drink the Pylobactell 13C-urea solution. If H. pylori is present and active in your \n\nstomach, these bacteria will break down the 13C-urea and this is detected in the carbon dioxide in your \n\nbreath. \n\nA further 3 samples of your breath will then be taken 30 minutes later. \n\n \n\nThe amount of 13C in these samples will be compared to your normal level. If there is a significant \n\nincrease in the amount of 13C, this will let your doctor know that active H. pylori is present.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU USE PYLOBACTELL \n \n\nDO NOT use Pylobactell if you: \n\n- are allergic to 13C-urea or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section 6). \n\n- suffer from any medical condition that you think may affect, or be affected by, the test.  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pylobactell if: \n\n\u2022 part of your stomach has been removed (partial gastrectomy) as the reliability of the test has \n\nnot been proven in these patients \n\n\u2022 you have or suspect you have a gastric infection \n\n\u2022 you have long term stomach problems (atrophic gastritis) as the breath test may give the \n\nwrong result and other tests may be required to confirm the presence of H. pylori. \n\n\u2022 fasting (not taking food) may have medical implications for you \n\n\u2022 you are under 18 years. \n \n\nOther medicines and Pylobactell \n\nPlease tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any \n\nother medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nDo not take the test if: \n\n \n\n\u2022 You have taken antibiotics or medication to treat Helicobacter pylori within the last 28 days \n\n \n\n\u2022 You have taken proton pump inhibitors in the last 14 days \n\n \n\n\u2022 You have taken H2 antagonists or antacids on the same day of the test. \n\n \n\nDo not stop taking medication without the advice of your doctor. \n\n \n\nTaking Pylobactell with food and drink \n\nYou should fast for at least 4 hours before the test so that the test is taken on an empty stomach. If you \n\nhave eaten a heavy meal it will be necessary to fast for six hours before the test. \n\nYou can drink water during the fasting period. \n\nIf fasting is a problem e.g. for diabetic patients, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPylobactell can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis test should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n3. HOW TO USE PYLOBACTELL  \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe test will take about 45 minutes. A supply of drinking water will be needed. \n\nIt is recommended that the breath test is performed while you are in a seated position. \n\nYou must not smoke before or during the test.  \n\n \n\nThe test procedure involves the following steps: \n\n(A brief form of these instructions is included on the back of the Analysis Request Form) \n\n \n\n1. Fasting:  \n\nYou should fast for 4 hours before taking the test (See Section 2 Taking Pylobactell with food \n\nand drink) \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2. Test Meal:  \n\nDrink the recommended test meal. This is not included in this kit but may have been supplied \n\nseparately. If no test meal has been supplied, the most suitable test meal is 200 ml of pure \n\nundiluted orange juice. If you cannot take the recommended test meal, an alternative test meal \n\nshould be taken. Your doctor will advise you. \n\n \n\n3. Wait 5 minutes \n\n \n\n4. Pre-test Breath Samples (3 White Capped Tubes) \n\n  \n\n i. Remove the cap from the tube \n\n ii. Breathe out through your mouth, using a straw, into the sample tube. \n\n iii. Gradually remove the straw from the tube as you breathe out. \n\n iv. Immediately replace the cap. \n\n v. Repeat with remaining white capped tubes. \n\n \n\n It is not necessary to blow hard into the tubes, just breathe normally and cap them quickly. \n\n Try to avoid getting saliva in the tubes. \n\n \n\n5. Preparing the 13Carbon-urea solution \n\n Open the tablet sachet and empty the tablet into the mixer vial. \n\n Add water to the mark on the vial and replace the cap. \n\n Gently shake the vial to dissolve the tablet. \n\n Drink the solution. Note the time upon drinking. \n\n Fill the vial to the mark again with water and drink. \n\n \n\n6. Wait 30 minutes from the time of drinking the Pylobactell 13C-urea solution. Do not smoke, \n\neat or drink during this time. This is important for the proper functioning of the test.  \n\n \n\n7. Post-test Breath Samples (3 Red Capped Tubes) \n\n Using the red-capped, take samples of your breath as before (see step 4). \n\n \n\n8. Analysis Request Form \n\n Fill out the analysis request form with patient details on the left hand side of the form and the \n\ndoctor\u2019s name and address on the right hand side. \n\n \n\n9. Test is now complete \n\n Put your breath samples and the completed Analysis Request Form back into the carton and \n\nsend to the address supplied by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you when the results of your \n\ntest will be available and who to contact for these results. \n\n \n\nDispose of the empty sachet, mixing vial and straws as normal waste, but keep this leaflet for \n\nreference. \n\n \n\nIf a repeat test is required, it should not be carried out until the following day. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \n\nNo side effects to Pylobactell have been reported. 13C and urea are harmless naturally occurring \n\nsubstances which are found in your body.  \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. HOW TO STORE PYLOBACTELL \n\n \n\nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not store the kit above 25\u00b0C. \n\nThe tablet must be taken when dissolved. \n\nDo not use Pylobactell after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\n6.

This should \n\nbe checked routinely. \n\n \n\nInternal analytical precision must be less than + 0.3 \u2030 \uf06413C for 20 replicate analyses of the same \n\nreference gas sample and remain within 3SD\u2019s of the mean for breath analyses. \n\n \n\nTransfer of the breath sample through the analytical system must be accomplished without isotope \n\nfractionation. \n\n \n\nThe IRMS must possess a triple collector to allow the simultaneous detection of the ions at \n\nmass/charge ratio 44, 45 and 46 to allow for fluctuations in the oxygen isotope content. \n\n \n\nThere must be provision for correction of instrumental drift during an analysis. \n\n \n\nReference gases must be standardised against an appropriate international standard to allow inter-\n\nlaboratory comparison of results. \n\n \n\nAlternatively, any other suitably-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively \n\nqualified laboratory.  \n\n \n\nExplanation of results:- \n\n \n\n\uf064 13C:- Difference in parts per thousand (\u2030) with respect to an accepted international \n\nstandard  \n\nExcess \uf06413C:-            Difference between pre- and post-urea sample measurements \n\n \n\nH. pylori status: -  < 3.5 excess \uf06413C = Negative    \n\n    > 3.5 excess \uf06413C = Positive \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nANALYSIS REQUEST FORM: \n\n \n\nPylobactell [13Carbon] -UREA BREATH TEST (13C-UBT) for Helicobacter pylori  \n\n \n\nANALYSIS REQUEST FORM - Please complete in block capitals \n\nPlease state clearly address for return of results: \n\nCentre:     \n\nPatient Name:   \n\nDate of Birth:            \n\nPatient Reference:     \n\nDate of Test:            \n\nReferring Doctor:     \n\n \n\nAFFIX BAR-CODE LABEL HERE \n\nPLEASE PLACE BAR-CODE LABEL ON PATIENT RECORDS, IF APPLICABLE \n\n \n\nM.A. Number: EU/1/98/064/001 \n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder: Torbet Laboratories Ireland Limited, 20 Holles Street, Dublin 2, \n\nIreland \n\n \nMEDICATION RECORD   TEST CHECK LIST  \nMedical History - has the patient \ntaken : \n \n\nType \n&Date \n\nMins \n \n\nTest Check List Time \n \n\n(i) antibiotics in the last 28 days? \nIf so, please indicate type and \nwhen last taken \n\n t = 0 \n \n\nNote time patient drinks test \nmeal \n \n\n \n\n \n(ii) proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \nin the last 14 days? \nIf so, please indicate type and \nwhen last taken. \n \n\n t = 5 \n \n\nCollect Pre-Urea samples \n(White Caps - 3 times) \n \n\n \n\n(iii) eradication therapy in the last  \n28 days?  \nIf so, please indicate when \ntreatment ended \n\n t = 10 \n \n\nPatient to drink urea solution, \nthen fill bottle to line again and \ndrink.   \n\n \n\n \n(iv) other medication (if \napplicable) \n \n\n t = 40 \n \n\nCollect Post-Urea samples (Red \nCaps -   3 times). \n \n\n \n\n(v) patient fasted for   hours  \n \nPlease note that (i) - (iii) will affect \nresult of test. \n\n  Check Bar-code label and all details \nentered on Analysis Request \nForm.   \n1 x Pre/Post sample reserved in \nstore.   \n2 x Pre/Post samples + this \nform for return to a qualified \nlaboratory. \n\n \n\nLaboratory use only \nDate received:         \nAnalytical file reference:   \nLaboratory code:  \nSamples logged on by :   \n\n \nComments:   \n  \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what pylobactell is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "pylobactell is a breath test for determining the presence of the bacterium, helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) in the gut (stomach and adjacent bowel) which may be the reason for your stomach (gastric) condition. your doctor has recommended that you have a 13c-urea breath test, for one of the following reasons: your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from h. pylori infection to help diagnose your condition. you have already been diagnosed with h. pylori and have been taking medication aimed to clear up the infection. your doctor now wants to find out if the treatment has worked. this medicine is for diagnostic use only. how does the test work? all foods contain a substance called carbon 13 (13c), in varying amounts. this 13c can be detected in the carbon dioxide that you breathe out of your lungs. the actual amount of 13c in the breath will depend on the type of food that you have eaten. you will be asked to drink a \"test meal\". this will help keep the test 13c-urea solution in your stomach. following the meal, 3 samples of your breath will be taken. these samples will be analysed to measure the normal amount of 13c in the carbon dioxide in your breath. you will then drink the pylobactell 13c-urea solution. if h. pylori is present and active in your stomach, these bacteria will break down the 13c-urea and this is detected in the carbon dioxide in your breath. a further 3 samples of your breath will then be taken 30 minutes later. the amount of 13c in these samples will be compared to your normal level. if there is a significant increase in the amount of 13c, this will let your doctor know that active h. pylori is present.",

or nurse if you are not sure. the test will take about 45 minutes. a supply of drinking water will be needed. it is recommended that the breath test is performed while you are in a seated position. you must not smoke before or during the test. the test procedure involves the following steps: (a brief form of these instructions is included on the back of the analysis request form) 1. fasting: you should fast for 4 hours before taking the test (see section 2 taking pylobactell with food and drink) 19 2. test meal: drink the recommended test meal. this is not included in this kit but may have been supplied separately. if no test meal has been supplied, the most suitable test meal is 200 ml of pure undiluted orange juice. if you cannot take the recommended test meal, an alternative test meal should be taken. your doctor will advise you. 3. wait 5 minutes 4. pre-test breath samples (3 white capped tubes) i. remove the cap from the tube ii. breathe out through your mouth, using a straw, into the sample tube. iii. gradually remove the straw from the tube as you breathe out. iv. immediately replace the cap. v. repeat with remaining white capped tubes. it is not necessary to blow hard into the tubes, just breathe normally and cap them quickly. try to avoid getting saliva in the tubes. 5. preparing the 13carbon-urea solution open the tablet sachet and empty the tablet into the mixer vial. add water to the mark on the vial and replace the cap. gently shake the vial to dissolve the tablet. drink the solution. note the time upon drinking. fill the vial to the mark again with water and drink. 6. wait 30 minutes from the time of drinking the pylobactell 13c-urea solution. do not smoke, eat or drink during this time. this is important for the proper functioning of the test. 7. post-test breath samples (3 red capped tubes) using the red-capped, take samples of your breath as before (see step 4). 8. analysis request form fill out the analysis request form with patient details on the left hand side of the form and the doctor's name and address on the right hand side. 9. test is now complete put your breath samples and the completed analysis request form back into the carton and send to the address supplied by your doctor. your doctor will tell you when the results of your test will be available and who to contact for these results. dispose of the empty sachet, mixing vial and straws as normal waste, but keep this leaflet for reference. if a repeat test is required, it should not be carried out until the following day. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pylobactell", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the test", "Type":
