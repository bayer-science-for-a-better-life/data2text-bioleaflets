NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKetek 400 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 400 mg of telithromycin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nLight orange, oblong, biconvex tablet, imprinted with ‘H3647’ on one side and ‘400’ on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nWhen prescribing Ketek, consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of \nantibacterial agents and the local prevalence of resistance (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nKetek is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: \n \nIn patients of 18 years and older: \n\n• Community-acquired pneumonia, mild or moderate (see section 4.4). \n \n• When treating infections caused by known or suspected beta-lactam and/or macrolide resistant \nstrains (according to history of patients or national and/or regional resistance data) covered by \nthe antibacterial spectrum of telithromycin (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): \n\n- Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, \n- Acute sinusitis \n\n \nIn patients of 12 years and older: \n\n• Tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, as an alternative when beta lactam \nantibiotics are not appropriate in countries/regions with a significant prevalence of macrolide \nresistant S. pyogenes, when mediated by ermTR or mefA (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 800 mg once a day i.e. two 400 mg tablets once a day.  \n \nIn patients of 18 years and older, according to the indication, the treatment regimen will be: \n- Community-acquired pneumonia: 800 mg once a day for 7 to 10 days, \n- Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: 800 mg once a day for 5 days, \n- Acute sinusitis: 800 mg once a day for 5 days, \n- Tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes: 800 mg once a day for 5 days. \n \nIn patients of 12 to 18 years old, the treatment regimen will be: \n- Tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes: 800 mg once a day for 5 days. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly population \nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients based on age alone. \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Ketek in children below 12 years of age have not been established (see \nsection 5.2). Ketek is not recommended in this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Ketek is not \nrecommended as first choice in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) or patients with both severe renal impairment and co-existing hepatic impairment, as an \noptimal dosage format (600 mg) is not available. If telithromycin treatment is deemed necessary, these \npatients may be treated with alternating daily doses of 800 mg and 400 mg, starting with the 800 mg \ndose. \nIn haemodialysed patients, the posology should be adjusted so that Ketek 800 mg is given after the \ndialysis session (see also section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, \nhowever the experience in patients with impaired hepatic function is limited. Hence, telithromycin \nshould be used with caution (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with a sufficient amount of water. The tablets may be taken \nwith or without food. \nConsideration may be given to taking Ketek at bedtime, to reduce the potential impact of visual \ndisturbances and loss of consciousness (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the macrolide antibacterial agents, or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nMyasthenia gravis (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevious history of hepatitis and/or jaundice associated with the use of telithromycin. \n \nConcomitant administration with medicinal products that prolong the QT interval and are CYP3A4 \nsubstrates, such as cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, dronedarone, saquinavir (see section \n4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration with ergot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration with simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin. Treatment with these \nagents should be interrupted during Ketek treatment (see section 4.5). \n \nHistory of congenital or a family history of long QT syndrome (if not excluded by ECG) and in \npatients with known acquired QT interval prolongation.  \n \nIn patients with severely impaired renal and/or hepatic function, concomitant administration of Ketek \nand strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors or azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, \nfluconazole), is contraindicated. \n \nConcomitant administration of Ketek and colchicine in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nQT interval prolongation \nDue to a potential to increase the QT interval, Ketek should be used with care in patients with \ncoronary heart disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalaemia and/or \nhypomagnesaemia, or bradycardia (<50 bpm), during concomitant administration of Ketek with QT \ninterval prolonging agents, or in patients concomitantly treated with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such \nas protease inhibitors or azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole) (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \nVentricular arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes) have been reported in \npatients treated with telithromycin and sometimes occurred within a few hours of the first dose (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nClostridium difficile-associated disease \nDiarrhoea, particularly if severe, persistent and /or bloody, during or after treatment with Ketek may \nbe caused by pseudomembranous colitis (see section 4.8). If pseudomembranous colitis is suspected, \nthe treatment must be stopped immediately and patients should be treated with supportive measures \nand/or specific therapy. \n \nMyasthenia gravis \nExacerbations of myasthenia gravis have been reported in patients treated with telithromycin and \nsometimes occurred within a few hours of the first dose. Reports have included death and life \nthreatening acute respiratory failure with rapid onset (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nAlterations in hepatic enzymes have been commonly observed in clinical studies with telithromycin. \nPost-marketing cases of severe hepatitis and liver failure, including fatal cases (which have generally \nbeen associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medicinal products), have been \nreported (see section 4.8). These hepatic reactions were observed during or immediately after \ntreatment, and in most cases were reversible after discontinuation of telithromycin. \nPatients should be advised to stop treatment and contact their doctor if signs and symptoms of hepatic \ndisease develop such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus or tender abdomen. \n \nDue to limited experience, Ketek should be used with caution in patients with liver impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nVisual disturbances \nKetek may cause visual disturbances particularly in slowing the ability to accommodate and the \nability to release accommodation. Visual disturbances included blurred vision, difficulty focusing, \nand diplopia. Most events were mild to moderate; however, severe cases have been reported. The \nonset of the visual reaction may be sudden. It is important that patients prescribed telithromycin \nshould be informed that visual adverse reactions may occur during the treatment (see sections 4.7 and \n4.8). \n \nLoss of consciousness \nThere have been post-marketing adverse reaction reports of transient loss of consciousness including \nsome cases associated with vagal syndrome (see sections 4.7 and 4.8). \n \nConsideration may be given to taking Ketek at bedtime, to reduce the potential impact of visual \ndisturbances and loss of consciousness. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nKetek should not be used during and 2 weeks after treatment with CYP3A4 inducers (such as \nrifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort). Concomitant treatment with \nthese medicinal products is likely to result in subtherapeutic levels of telithromycin and therefore \nencompass a risk of treatment failure (see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nKetek is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Patients with concomitant \ntreatment of pravastatin, rosuvastatin or fluvastatin should be carefully monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. (See sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nResistance \nIn areas with a high incidence of erythromycin A resistance, it is especially important to take into \nconsideration the evolution of the pattern of susceptibility to telithromycin and other antibiotics. \n \nIn community acquired pneumonia, efficacy has been demonstrated in a limited number of patients \nwith risk factors such as pneumococcal bacteraemia or age higher than 65 years. \n \nExperience of treatment of infections caused by penicillin/or erythromycin resistant S. pneumoniae is \nlimited, but so far, clinical efficacy and eradication rates have been similar compared with the \ntreatment of susceptible S. pneumoniae.  Caution should be taken when S. aureus is the suspected \npathogen and there is a likelihood of erythromycin resistance based on local epidemiology.  \n \nL. pneumophila is highly susceptible to telithromycin in vitro, however, the clinical experience of the \ntreatment of pneumonia caused by legionella is limited.  \n \nAs for macrolides, H. influenzae is classified as intermediately susceptible. This should be taken into \naccount when treating infections caused by H. influenzae. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n• Effect of Ketek on other medicinal products \n \nTelithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. In vivo studies with \nsimvastatin, midazolam and cisapride have demonstrated a potent inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 and \na moderate inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4. The degree of inhibition with different CYP3A4 substrates \nis difficult to predict. Hence, Ketek should not be used during treatment with medicinal products that \nare CYP3A4 substrates, unless plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate, efficacy or adverse \nreactions can be closely monitored. Alternatively, interruption in the treatment with the CYP3A4 \nsubstrate should be made during treatment with Ketek. \n \nTelithromycin is also a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Concomitant administration of Ketek with drugs that \nare substrates of P-glycoprotein might result in increased exposure to the P-glycoprotein substrates \nsuch as digoxin and dabigatran etexilate. If telithromycin is co-administered with dabigatran etexilate \nclose clinical monitoring (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) should be exercised. \n \nCyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus \nDue to its CYP3A4 inhibitory potential, telithromycin can increase blood concentrations of these \nCYP34A4 substrates. Thus, when initiating telithromycin in patients already receiving any of theses \nimmunosuppressive agents, cyclosporin, tacrolimus or sirolimus levels must be carefully monitored \nand their doses decreased as necessary. When telithromycin is discontinued, cyclosporin, tacrolimus \nor sirolimus levels must be again carefully monitored and their dose increased as necessary. \n \nMetoprolol \nWhen metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate) was coadministered with Ketek, metropolol Cmax and AUC \nwere increased by approximately 38%, however, there was no effect on the elimination half-life of \nmetoprolol. The increase exposure to metoprolol may be of clinical importance in patients with heart \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nfailure treated with metoprolol. In these patients, co-administration of Ketek and metoprolol, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, should be considered with caution. \n \nMedicinal products with a potential to prolong QT interval \nKetek is expected to increase the plasma levels of cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, \ndronedarone, saquinavir. This could result in QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias \nincluding ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes. Concomitant \nadministration of Ketek and any of these medicinal products is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCaution is warranted when Ketek is administered to patients taking other medicinal products with the \npotential to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.4). These include Class IA (e.g.quinidine, \nprocainamide, disopyramide) and Class III (e.g. dofetilide, amiodarone) antiarrhythmic agents, \ncitalopram, tricyclic antidepressants, methadone, some antipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines),  \nfluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin), some antifungals (e.g. fluconazole, pentamidine), and some \nantiviral drugs (e.g. telaprevir). \n \nErgot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) \nBy extrapolation from erythromycin A and josamycin, concomitant medication of Ketek and alkaloid \nderivatives could lead to severe vasoconstriction (“ergotism”) with possibly necrosis of the \nextremities. The combination is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nStatins \nWhen simvastatin was coadministered with Ketek, there was a 5.3-fold increase in simvastatin Cmax, \nan 8.9-fold increase in simvastatin AUC, a 15-fold increase in simvastatin acid Cmax and an 11-fold \nincrease in simvastatin acid AUC. Ketek may produce a similar interaction with lovastatin and \natorvastatin which are also mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. Ketek should therefore not be used \nconcomitantly with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin (see section 4.3). Treatment with these \nagents should be interrupted during Ketek treatment. The exposure of pravastatin, rosuvastatin and to \na lesser extent fluvastatin, may be increased due to possible involvement of transporters proteins, but \nthis increase is expected to be lesser than interactions involving CYP3A4 inhibition. However, \npatients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis \nwhen co-treated with pravastatin, rosuvastatin and fluvastatin. \n \nBenzodiazepines \nWhen midazolam was coadministered with Ketek, midazolam AUC was increased 2.2-fold after \nintravenous administration of midazolam and 6.1-fold after oral administration. The midazolam half-\nlife was increased about 2.5-fold. Oral administration of midazolam concomitantly with Ketek should \nbe avoided. Intravenous dosage of midazolam should be adjusted as necessary and monitoring of the \npatient should be undertaken. The same precautions should also apply to the other benzodiazepines \nwhich are metabolised by CYP3A4, (especially triazolam but also to a lesser extent alprazolam). For \nthose benzodiazepines which are not metabolised by CYP3A4 (temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam) \nan interaction with Ketek is unlikely. \n \nDigoxin \nKetek has been shown to increase the plasma concentrations of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate. \nThe plasma trough levels, Cmax, AUC and renal clearance were increased by 20%, 73%, 37% and 27% \nrespectively, in healthy volunteers. There were no significant changes in ECG parameters and no \nsigns of digoxin toxicity were observed. Nevertheless, monitoring of serum digoxin level should be \nconsidered during concomitant administration of digoxin and Ketek. \n \nTheophylline \nThere is no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction of Ketek and theophylline administered as \nextended release formulation. However, the co-administration of both medicinal products should be \nseparated by one hour in order to avoid possible digestive side effects such as nausea and vomiting. \n \nOral anticoagulants \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nIncreased anticoagulant activity has been reported in patients simultaneously treated with \nanticoagulants and antibiotics, including telithromycin. The mechanisms are incompletely known. \nAlthough Ketek has no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with \nwarfarin after single dose administration, more frequent monitoring of prothrombin time/INR \n(International Normalised Ratio) values should be considered during concomitant treatment. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThere is no pharmacodynamic or clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with low-dose \ntriphasic oral contraceptives in healthy subjects. \n \nColchicine \nColchicine intoxication, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with colchicine \nand strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors. Telithromycin is known to be a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and is also a \nP-glycoprotein inhibitor. Exposure to colchicine, a CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate, may \ntherefore be expected to increase if Ketek and colchicine are co-administered. Concomitant \nadministration of Ketek and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.3).  \n \nCalcium channel blockers that are metabolized by CYP3A4  \nConcomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as telithromycin) and calcium channel \nblockers that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine) may result in \nhypotension, bradycardia or loss of consciousness, and should therefore be avoided. In case the \ncombination is considered necessary, the dose of the calcium channel blocker should be reduced and \nclose clinical monitoring of efficacy and safety in the patient should be exercised. \n \nSotalol \nTelithromycin has been shown to decrease the Cmax by 34 % and AUC of sotalol by 20 % due to \ndecreased absorption. \n \n• Effect of other medicinal products on Ketek \n \nDuring concomitant administration of rifampicin and telithromycin in repeated doses, Cmax and AUC \nof telithromycin were on average decreased by 79% and 86% respectively. Therefore, concomitant \nadministration of CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St \nJohn’s wort) is likely to result in subtherapeutic levels of telithromycin and loss of effect. The \ninduction gradually decreases during 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with CYP3A4 inducers. \nKetek should not be used during and 2 weeks after treatment with CYP3A4 inducers. \n \nInteraction studies with itraconazole and ketoconazole, two CYP3A4 inhibitors, showed that \nmaximum plasma concentrations of telithromycin were increased respectively by 1.22 and 1.51 fold \nand AUC by respectively 1.54 fold and 2.0 fold. These changes in the pharmacokinetics of \ntelithromycin do not necessitate dosage adjustment as telithromycin exposure remains within a well \ntolerated range. The effect of ritonavir on telithromycin has not been studied and could lead to larger \nincrease in telithromycin exposure. The combination should be used with caution. \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors must not be co-administered with Ketek in patients with severe renal/or \nhepatic dysfunction (see section 4.3). \n \nRanitidine (taken 1 hour before Ketek) and antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide \nhas no clinically relevant influence on telithromycin pharmacokinetics. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Ketek in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Ketek should not be \nused during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreastfeeding \nTelithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals, at concentrations about 5 times those of \nmaternal plasma. Corresponding data for humans is not available. Ketek should not be used by breast-\nfeeding women. \n \nFertility \nIn studies with rats a reduction in fertility indices was observed at parentally toxic doses (see section \n5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKetek may cause adverse reactions such as visual disturbances, confusion or hallucination which may \nreduce the capacity for the completion of certain tasks. In addition, rare cases of transient loss of \nconsciousness, which may be preceded by vagal symptoms, have been reported (see section 4.8). \nBecause of potential visual difficulties, loss of consciousness, confusion or hallucination, patients \nshould attempt to minimize activities such as driving a motor vehicle, operating heavy machinery or \nengaging in other hazardous activities during treatment with Ketek. If patients experience visual \ndisorders, loss of consciousness, confusion or hallucination while taking Ketek, patients should not \ndrive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery or engage in other hazardous activities (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8). \nPatients should be informed that these adverse reactions may occur as early as after the first dose of \nmedicinal product. Patients should be cautioned about the potential effects of these events on the \nability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nIn 2,461 patients treated by Ketek in phase III clinical trials, and during post-marketing experience, \nthe following undesirable effects possibly or probably related to telithromycin have been reported. \nThis is shown in the table below.

The onset of the visual reaction may be sudden. These events have not been associated with \nsigns of ocular abnormality (see sections 4.4 and 4.7). \n \nIn clinical trials the effect on QTc was small (mean of approximately 1 msec). In comparative trials, \nsimilar effects to those observed with clarithromycin were seen with an on-therapy ΔQTc >30 msec in \n7.6% and 7.0% of cases, respectively. No patient in either group developed a ΔQTc >60 msec. There \nwere no reports of TdP or other serious ventricular arrhythmias or related syncope in the clinical \nprogram and no subgroups at risk were identified. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of acute overdose the stomach should be emptied. The patients should be carefully \nobserved and given symptomatic and supportive treatment. Adequate hydration should be maintained. \nBlood electrolytes (especially potassium) must be controlled. Due to the potential for the prolongation \nof the QT interval and increased risk of arrhythmia, ECG monitoring must take place. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, macrolides, lincosamides and \nstreptogramins, ATC Code: J01FA15. \n \nTelithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin A belonging to the ketolides, a class of \nantibacterial agents related to macrolides. \n \nMode of action \n \nTelithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with domains II and V of the 23S ribosomal \nRNA of the 50S ribosome subunit. Furthermore, telithromycin is able to block the formation of the \n50S and 30S ribosomal subunits. \n \nThe affinity of telithromycin for the 50S ribosomal subunits of organisms susceptible to erythromycin \nA is 10-fold higher than that of erythromycin A. \n \nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship: \nThe AUC/MIC ratio has been shown to be the PK/PD parameter that correlates best with the efficacy \nof telithromycin. \n \nMechanisms of resistance \n \nTelithromycin does not induce expression of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB)-\nmediated resistance in vitro in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Streptococcus \npyogenes.  \n \nIn some organisms that are resistant to erythromycin A due to inducible expression of the MLSB \nresistance determinant, the affinity of telithromycin for the 50S ribosomal subunit is more than 20-\nfold that of erythromycin A.  \n \nTelithromycin is not active against organisms that constitutively express the MLSB resistance \ndeterminant (cMLSB). The majority of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) express cMLSB. \n \nIn in vitro studies the activity of telithromycin was reduced against organisms that express the \nerythromycin erm(B) or mef(A) related resistance mechanisms.  \n \nExposure to telithromycin in vitro did select for pneumococcal mutants with increased MICs of \ntelithromycin, generally resulting in MIC values of ≤1 mg/l.  \n \nStreptococcus pneumoniae does not demonstrate cross-resistance between erythromycin A and \ntelithromycin.  \n \nStreptococcus pyogenes that show high-level resistance to erythromycin A are cross-resistant to \ntelithromycin. \n \nBreakpoints \n \nThe recommended European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC \nclinical breakpoints are presented below: \n \nPathogen Susceptible Resistant \nStreptococcus A, B, C, G ≤0.25 mg/l >0.5 mg/l \nStreptococcus pneumoniae ≤0.25 mg/l >0.5 mg/l \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nHaemophilus influenzae1 ≤0.12 mg/l >8 mg/l \nMoraxella catarrhalis ≤0.25 mg/l >0.5 mg/l \n \n1The correlation between macrolide MICs and clinical outcome is weak for H. influenzae. Therefore \nthe MIC breakpoint for telithromycin was set to categorise wild-type H. influenzae as having \nintermediate susceptibility. \n \nAntibacterial spectrum \n \nThe prevalence of resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species and local \ninformation on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, \nexpert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the \nagent in at least some types of infections is questionable. \n \nCommonly susceptible species \nAerobic Gram-positive bacteria \nStaphylococcus aureus methicillin susceptible (MSSA)*  \nStreptococcus pneumoniae * \nStreptococcus species \nViridans group streptococci \n \nAerobic Gram- negative bacteria \nHaemophilus influenzae$* \nHaemophilus parainfluenzae$ \nLegionella pneumophila \nMoraxella catarrhalis* \n \nOther \nChlamydophila pneumoniae* \nChlamydia psittaci \nMycoplasma pneumoniae* \n \n\nSpecies for which acquired resistance may be a problem \nAerobic Gram-positive bacteria \nStaphylococcus aureus methicillin resistant (MRSA)+ \nStreptococcus pyogenes* \n \nInherently resistant organisms \nAerobic Gram- negative bacteria \nAcinetobacter  \nEnterobacteriaceae \nPseudomonas \n\n \n∗ Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for susceptible isolates in the approved clinical indications. \n$ natural intermediate susceptibility \n+ Telithromycin is not active against organisms that constitutively express the MLSB resistance \ndeterminant (cMLSB). More than 80% of MRSA express cMLSB. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, telithromycin is fairly rapidly absorbed. A mean maximum plasma \nconcentration of about 2 mg/l is reached within 1-3 hour after dose with once-daily dosing of \ntelithromycin 800 mg. The absolute bioavailability is about 57% after a single dose of 800 mg.

At steady-state AUC is approximately 1.5 \nfold increased compared to the single dose. \n \nMean peak and trough plasma concentrations at steady state in patients were 2.9±1.6 mg/l (range \n0.02-7.6 mg/l) and 0.2±0.2 mg/l (range 0.010 to 1.29 mg/l), during a therapeutic 800 mg once-daily \ndose regimen. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro protein binding is approximately 60% to 70%. Telithromycin is widely distributed \nthroughout the body. The volume of distribution is 2.9±1.0 l/kg. Rapid distribution of telithromycin \ninto tissues results in significantly higher telithromycin concentrations in most target tissues than in \nplasma. The maximum total tissue concentration in epithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, \nbronchial mucosa, tonsils and sinus tissue were 14.9±11.4 mg/l, 318.1±231 mg/l, 3.88±1.87 mg/kg, \n3.95±0.53 mg/kg and 6.96±1.58 mg/kg, respectively. The total tissue concentration 24 h after dose in \nepithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa, tonsils and sinus tissue were \n0.84±0.65 mg/l, 162±96 mg/l, 0.78±0.39 mg/kg, 0.72±0.29 mg/kg and 1.58±1.68 mg/kg, respectively. \nThe mean maximum white blood cell concentration of telithromycin was 83±25 mg/l. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTelithromycin is metabolised primarily by the liver. After oral administration, two-thirds of the dose \nis eliminated as metabolites and one-third unchanged. The main circulating compound in plasma is \ntelithromycin. Its principal circulating metabolite represents approximately 13% of telithromycin \nAUC, and has little antimicrobial activity compared with the parent medicinal product. Other \nmetabolites were detected in plasma, urine and faeces and represent less or equal than 3% of plasma \nAUC. \n \nTelithromycin is metabolised both by CYP450 isoenzymes and non-CYP enzymes. The major \nCYP450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of telithromycin is CYP3A4. Telithromycin is an \ninhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, but has no or limited effect on CYP1A, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, \n2C19 and 2E1. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration of radiolabelled telithromycin, 76% of the radioactivity was recovered from \nfaeces, and 17% from the urine. Approximately one-third of telithromycin was eliminated unchanged; \n20% in faeces and 12% in urine. Telithromycin displays moderate non-linear pharmacokinetics. The \nnon-renal clearance is decreased as the dose is increased. The total clearance (mean ±SD) is \napproximately 58±5 l/h after an intravenous administration with renal clearance accounting for about \n22% of this. Telithromycin displays a tri-exponential decay from plasma, with a rapid distribution \nhalf-life of 0.17 h. The main elimination half-life of telithromycin is 2-3 h and the terminal, less \nimportant, half-life is about 10 h at the dose 800 mg once daily. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n-Renal impairment \nIn a multiple-dose study, 36 subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, a 1.4-fold increase in \nCmax,ss, and a 2-fold increase in AUC (0-24)ss at 800 mg multiple doses in the severe renally impaired \ngroup (CLCR < 30 ml/min) compared to healthy volunteers were observed and a reduced dosage of \nKetek is recommended (see section 4.2). Based on observed data, a 600 mg daily dose is \napproximately equivalent with the target exposure observed in healthy subjects. Based on simulation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\ndata, an alternating daily dosing regimen of 800 mg and 400 mg in patients with severe renal \nimpairment can approximate the AUC (0-48h) in healthy subjects receiving 800 mg once daily.  \n \nThe effect of dialysis on the elimination of telithromycin has not been assessed.  \n \n-Hepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study (800 mg) in 12 patients and a multiple-dose study (800 mg) in 13 patients with \nmild to severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Class A, B and C), the Cmax, AUC and t1/2 of \ntelithromycin were similar compared to those obtained in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In \nboth studies, higher renal elimination was observed in the hepatically impaired patients. Due to \nlimited experience in patients with decreased metabolic capacity of the liver, Ketek should be used \nwith caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see also section 4.4). \n \n-Elderly subjects  \nIn subjects over 65 (median 75 years), the maximum plasma concentration and AUC of telithromycin \nwere increased approximately 2-fold compared with those achieved in young healthy adults. These \nchanges in pharmacokinetics do not necessitate dosage adjustment. \n \n-Paediatric population  \nLimited data, obtained in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age, showed that telithromycin \nconcentrations in this age group were similar to the concentrations in patients 18 to 40 years of age. \n \n-Gender \nThe pharmacokinetics of telithromycin is similar between males and females. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies of 1, 3 and 6 month duration with telithromycin conducted in rat, dog \nand monkey showed that the liver was the principal target for toxicity with elevations of liver \nenzymes, and histological evidence of damage. These effects showed a tendency to regress after \ncessation of treatment. Plasma exposures based on free fraction of active substance, at the no \nobserved adverse effect levels ranged from 1.6 to 13 times the expected clinical exposure.  \n \nPhospholipidosis (intracellular phospholipid accumulation) affecting a number of organs and tissues \n(e.g., liver, kidney, lung, thymus, spleen, gall bladder, mesenteric lymph nodes, GI-tract) has been \nobserved in rats and dogs administered telithromycin at repeated doses of 150 mg/kg/day or more for \n1 month and 20 mg/kg/day or more for 3-6 months. This administration corresponds to free active \nsubstance systemic exposure levels of at least 9 times the expected levels in human after 1 month and \nless than the expected level in humans after 6 months, respectively. There was evidence of \nreversibility upon cessation of treatment. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. \n \nIn similarity to some macrolides, telithromycin caused a prolongation of QTc interval in dogs and on \naction potential duration in rabbit Purkinje fibers in vitro. Effects were evident at plasma levels of \nfree drug 8 to 13 times the expected clinical level. Hypokalaemia and quinidine had additive/supra-\nadditive effects in vitro while potentiation was evident with sotalol. Telithromycin, but not its major \nhuman metabolites, had inhibitory activity on HERG and Kv1.5 channels.  \n \nReproduction toxicity studies showed reduced gamete maturation in rat and adverse effects on \nfertilization. Slight reductions in fertility indices were seen in rats at parentally toxic doses higher \nthan 150 mg/kg. At high doses embryotoxicity was apparent and an increase in incomplete \nossification and in skeletal anomalies was seen. Studies in rats and rabbits were inconclusive with \nrespect to potential for teratogenicity; there was equivocal evidence of adverse effects on foetal \ndevelopment at high doses. \n \nTelithromycin, and its principal human metabolites, were negative in tests on genotoxic potential in \nvitro and in vivo. No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with telithromycin. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Ketek \n3. How to take Ketek \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ketek \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Ketek is and what it is used for \n \nKetek contains the active substance telithromycin. \n \nKetek is an antibiotic of the type macrolides. Antibiotics stop the growth of bacteria which cause \ninfections. \n \nKetek is used to treat infections due to bacteria against which the medicine is active. \n- In adults, Ketek is used to treat infections of the throat, infections of the sinuses (hollow cavities \n\nin the bones around the nose) and chest infections in patients with long standing breathing \ndifficulties and lung infection (pneumonia). \n\n- In adolescents of 12 years and older, Ketek is used to treat infections of the throat.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ketek \n \nDo not take Ketek: \n- if you are allergic to telithromycin, to any of the macrolide antibiotics or to any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If in doubt, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n- if you suffer from myasthenia gravis, a rare disease which causes muscle weakness. \n- if you have had a liver disease (hepatitis and/or jaundice) while taking Ketek in the past. \n- if you are taking other medicines that can prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram \n\n(ECG), such as: \n• terfenadine or astemizole (allergic problems) \n• cisapride (digestive problems) \n• pimozide (psychiatric problems) \n• dronedarone (for atrial fibrillation) \n• saquinavir (anti-HIV treatment) \n\n- if you are taking other medicines containing any of the following active substances: \n• ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (tablets or inhaler for migraine) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n- if you are taking certain medicinal products to control the blood level of cholesterol or other \nlipids like simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin, as the side effects of these medicinal products \ncould be increased. \n\n- if you or someone in your family are known to have an abnormality of electrocardiogram \n(ECG) called “long QT syndrome”. \n\n- if you have kidney problems (severely impaired renal function) and/or liver problems (severely \nimpaired hepatic function), do not take Ketek while taking other medicines containing any of the \nfollowing active substances: \n• ketoconazole or fluconazole (anti-fungal treatment) \n• a medicine called protease inhibitor (anti-HIV treatment) \n• colchicine (for gout) \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Ketek: \n- if you have had certain heart problems such as coronary heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias, \n\nbradycardia (changes in heart rate or electrocardiogram) or if you have had certain abnormal \nblood tests due to medical conditions such as low levels of potassium (hypokalaemia), low levels \nof magnesium (hypomagnesaemia). \n\n- if you have liver disease. \n- if you experience fainting (transient loss of consciousness) \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience irregular heartbeat. \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience visual disturbances (blurred vision, \ndifficulty focusing, double vision). These visual disturbances may happen suddenly and last several \nhours. You may experience this within a few hours of taking your daily dose of Ketek the first or \nsecond time. It may happen again when you take the next dose of Ketek. These effects usually \ndisappear during treatment or after completion of treatment with Ketek. \n \nIf any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before taking Ketek. \nIf you develop severe or prolonged or bloody diarrhoea during or after taking Ketek tablets, consult \nyour doctor immediately since it may be necessary to interrupt the treatment. This may be a sign of \nbowel inflammation which can occur following treatment with antibiotics. \n \nTo reduce the potential impact of visual disturbances take the tablets before going to bed (see also \nsection 3). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKetek is not recommended for use in children less than 12 years old. \n \nRefer also to sections “Do not take Ketek”, “Other medicines and Ketek” and “Driving and using \nmachines”. \n \nOther medicines and Ketek \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, as some of them could affect or be \naffected by Ketek. \n \nThese medicines must not be taken with Ketek: \n- medicinal products to control the blood level of cholesterol or other lipids like simvastatin, \n\natorvastatin, or lovastatin, as the side effects of the medicinal products could be increased. \n- other medicines that can prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), such as: \n\n• terfenadine or astemizole (allergic problems) \n• cisapride (digestive problems) \n• pimozide (psychiatric problems) \n• dronedarone (for atrial fibrillation) \n• saquinavir (anti-HIV treatment) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\n- other medicines containing any of the following active substances: \n• ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (tablets or inhaler for migraine) \n\n- if you have kidney problems (severely impaired renal function) and/or liver problems (severely \nimpaired hepatic function), other medicines containing any of the following active substances: \n• ketoconazole or fluconazole (anti-fungal treatment) \n• a medicine called protease inhibitor (anti-HIV treatment) \n• colchicine (for gout). \n\n \nIt is important to tell your doctor if you are taking: \n- medicines containing phenytoin, and carbamazepine (for epilepsy) \n- rifampicin (antibiotic) \n- phenobarbital or St John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat mild depression) \n- medicines like tacrolimus, cyclosporin and sirolimus (for organ transplantation) \n- metoprolol (for heart disorders) \n- sotalol (for heart disorders) \n- ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine). \n- medicines known to affect the way your heart beats (drugs that prolong the QT interval).  \n\nThese include medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics such as quinidine, \namiodarone), for depression (citalopram, tricyclic antidepressants), methadone, some \nantipsychotics (phenothiazines), some antibiotics (fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin), some \nantifungals (fluconazole, pentamidine), and some antiviral drugs (telaprevir). \n\n- medicines containing digoxin (for heart disorders) or dabigatran (for prevention of blood clots) \n- colchicine (for gout) \n- some calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine) (for heart disorders). \n \nKetek with food, drink and alcohol \nKetek may be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant do not take Ketek as the safety of this medicine in pregnancy is insufficiently \nestablished. If you are breast-feeding do not take Ketek. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLimit driving or other hazardous activities while taking Ketek. If you have vision problems, faint or \nexperience confusion or hallucination while taking Ketek, do not drive, operate heavy machinery or \nengage in dangerous activities. \n \nTaking Ketek may cause side effects such as visual disturbances, confusion or hallucination which \nmay reduce the capacity to carry out certain tasks. Rare cases of fainting (transient loss of \nconsciousness), which may be preceded by a general feeling of being sick (e.g. nausea, stomach \nupsets) have been reported. These symptoms may appear as early as after the first dose of Ketek. \n \n \n3. How to take Ketek \n \nYour doctor will tell you how many Ketek tablets to take, at what time and for how long. Always take \nthis medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with you doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe usual duration of treatment is 5 days for infections of the throat, infections of the sinuses, chest \ninfections in patients with long standing breathing difficulties and 7 to 10 days for pneumonia. \n \nThe recommended dose of Ketek for adults and children of 12 years and older is two tablets of 400 mg \nonce daily (800 mg once daily).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nIf you have kidney problems (severe renal insufficiency) you should take alternating daily doses of \n800 mg (two tablets of 400 mg) and 400 mg (one tablet of 400 mg), starting with the 800 mg dose. \n \nSwallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. \n \nIt is best to take tablets at the same time each day. If possible take the tablets before going to bed, to \nreduce the potential impact of visual disturbances and loss of consciousness. \n \nIf you take more Ketek than you should \nIf you accidentally take one tablet too many, nothing is likely to happen. If you accidentally take \nseveral tablets too many, contact your doctor or pharmacist. If possible, take your tablets or the box \nwith you to show the doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to take Ketek \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is nearly time for your next dose \nskip the missed dose and take the next tablet at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Ketek \nTake the complete course of tablets prescribed by your doctor, even if you begin to feel better before \nyou have finished them all. If you stop taking the tablets too soon, the infection may return, or your \ncondition may get worse.  \n \nIf you stop taking the tablets too soon you may also create a bacterial resistance to the medicine. \n \nIf you feel you are suffering from a side effect, tell a doctor immediately to get advice before taking \nthe next dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.
