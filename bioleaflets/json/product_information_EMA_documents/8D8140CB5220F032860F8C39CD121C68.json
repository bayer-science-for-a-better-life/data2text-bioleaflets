NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 500 mg deferiprone. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite to off-white, glossy surface, oval film-coated tablet. The tablet is scored. The tablet can be \ndivided into equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with \nthalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients \nwith thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention \nor treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload justifies rapid or intensive correction \n(see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDeferiprone therapy should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the treatment of \npatients with thalassaemia. \n \nPosology \nDeferiprone is usually given as 25 mg/kg body weight, orally, three times a day for a total daily dose \nof 75 mg/kg body weight. Dose per kilogram body weight should be calculated to the nearest half \ntablet. See tables below for recommended doses for body weights at 10 kg increments. \n \nTo obtain a dose of about 75 mg/kg/day, use the number of tablets suggested in the following tables \nfor the body weight of the patient. Sample body weights at 10 kg increments are listed. \n \nDose table for Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets \n\nBody weight \n(kg) \n\nTotal daily dose \n(mg) \n\nDose \n(mg, three times/day) \n\nNumber of tablets \n(three times/day) \n\n20 1500 500 1.0 \n30 2250 750 1.5 \n40 3000 1000 2.0 \n50 3750 1250 2.5 \n60 4500 1500 3.0 \n70 5250 1750 3.5 \n80 6000 2000 4.0 \n90 6750 2250 4.5 \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nA total daily dose above 100 mg/kg body weight is not recommended because of the potentially \nincreased risk of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 4.9). \n \nDose adjustment \nThe effect of Deferiprone Lipomed in decreasing the body iron is directly influenced by the dose and \nthe degree of iron overload. After starting Deferiprone Lipomed therapy, it is recommended that serum \nferritin concentrations, or other indicators of body iron load, be monitored every two to three months \nto assess the long-term effectiveness of the chelation regimen in controlling the body iron load. Dose \nadjustments should be tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance \nor reduction of body iron burden). Interruption of therapy with deferiprone should be considered if \nserum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l. \n \nDose adjustments when used with other iron chelators \nIn patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate, Deferiprone Lipomed may be used with \ndeferoxamine at the standard dose (75 mg/kg/day) but should not exceed 100 mg/kg/day. The product \ninformation of deferoxamine should be consulted. \n \nConcurrent use of iron chelators is not recommended in patients whose serum ferritin falls below \n500 µg/l due to the risk of excessive iron removal. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere are limited data available on the use of deferiprone in children between 6 and 10 years of age, \nand no data on deferiprone use in children under 6 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Deferiprone Lipomed in patients with end stage renal \ndisease are unknown. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (see \nsection 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Deferiprone Lipomed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are unknown. \n \nMethod of administration  \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• History of recurrent episodes of neutropenia. \n• History of agranulocytosis. \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n• Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n• Due to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take \n\nmedicinal products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause \nagranulocytosis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeutropenia/Agranulocytosis \nDeferiprone has been shown to cause neutropenia, including agranulocytosis (see section 4.8 \n‘Description of selected adverse reactions’). The patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \nshould be monitored every week during the first year of therapy. For patients whose deferiprone \nhas not been interrupted during the first year of therapy due to any decrease in the neutrophil \ncount, the frequency of ANC monitoring may be extended to the patient’s blood transfusion \ninterval (every 2 – 4 weeks) after one year of deferiprone therapy. \n \nThe change from weekly ANC monitoring to at the time of transfusion visits after 12 months of \ndeferiprone therapy should be considered on an individual patient basis, according to the physician’s \nassessment of the patient’s understanding of the risk minimization measures required during therapy \n(see section 4.4 below). \n \nIn clinical trials, weekly monitoring of the neutrophil count has been effective in identifying cases of \nneutropenia and agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon \ndiscontinuation of deferiprone, but fatal cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. If the patient \ndevelops an infection while on deferiprone, therapy should be immediately interrupted, and an ANC \nobtained without delay. The neutrophil count should then be monitored more frequently. \n \nPatients should be aware to contact their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative \nof infection (such as fever, sore throat and flu-like symptoms). Immediately interrupt \ndeferiprone if the patient experiences infection. \n \nSuggested management of cases of neutropenia is outlined below. It is recommended that such a \nmanagement protocol be in place prior to initiating any patient on deferiprone treatment. \n \nTreatment with deferiprone should not be initiated if the patient is neutropenic. The risk of \nagranulocytosis and neutropenia is higher if the baseline ANC is less than 1.5 x 109/l. \n \nFor neutropenia events (ANC < 1.5 x 109/l and > 0.5 x 109/l): \nInstruct the patient to immediately discontinue deferiprone and all other medicinal products with a \npotential to cause neutropenia. The patient should be advised to limit contact with other individuals in \norder to reduce the risk of infection. Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, with a white blood \ncell (WBC) count, corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, a neutrophil count, and a \nplatelet count immediately upon diagnosing the event and then repeat daily. It is recommended that \nfollowing recovery from neutropenia, weekly CBC, WBC, neutrophil and platelet counts continue to \nbe obtained for three consecutive weeks, to ensure that the patient recovers fully. Should any evidence \nof infection develop concurrently with the neutropenia, the appropriate cultures and diagnostic \nprocedures should be performed and an appropriate therapeutic regimen instituted. \n \nFor agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l): \nFollow the guidelines above and administer appropriate therapy such as granulocyte colony \nstimulating factor, beginning the same day that the event is identified; administer daily until the \ncondition resolves. Provide protective isolation and if clinically indicated, admit patient to the hospital. \n \nLimited information is available regarding re-challenge. Therefore, in the event of neutropenia, re-\nchallenge is not recommended. In the event of agranulocytosis, re-challenge is contraindicated. \n \nCarcinogenicity/mutagenicity \nIn view of the genotoxicity results, a carcinogenic potential of deferiprone cannot be excluded (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nPlasma Zn2+ concentration \nMonitoring of plasma Zn2+ concentration, and supplementation in case of a deficiency, is \nrecommended. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nHIV positive or other immunocompromised patients \nNo data are available on the use of deferiprone in HIV positive or other immunocompromised patients. \nGiven that deferiprone can be associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis, therapy in \nimmunocompromised patients should not be initiated unless potential benefits outweigh potential \nrisks. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment and liver fibrosis \nThere are no data available on the use of deferiprone in patients with end stage renal disease or severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Caution must be exercised in patients with end stage renal \ndisease or severe hepatic dysfunction. Renal and hepatic function should be monitored in these patient \npopulations during deferiprone therapy. If there is a persistent increase in serum alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), interruption of deferiprone therapy should be considered. \n \nIn thalassaemia patients there is an association between liver fibrosis and iron overload and/or \nhepatitis C. Special care must be taken to ensure that iron chelation in patients with hepatitis C is \noptimal. In these patients careful monitoring of liver histology is recommended. \n \nDiscoloration of urine \nPatients should be informed that their urine may show a reddish/brown discoloration due to the \nexcretion of the iron-deferiprone complex. \n \nChronic overdose and neurological disorders \nNeurological disorders have been observed in children treated with more than 2.5 times the maximum \nrecommended dose for several years but have also been observed with standard doses of deferiprone. \nPrescribers are reminded that the use of doses above 100 mg/kg/day is not recommended. Deferiprone \nuse should be discontinued if neurological disorders are observed (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). \n \nCombined use with other iron chelators \nThe use of combination therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The response to therapy \nshould be assessed periodically, and the occurrence of adverse events closely monitored. Fatalities and \nlife-threatening situations (caused by agranulocytosis) have been reported with deferiprone in \ncombination with deferoxamine. Combination therapy with deferoxamine is not recommended when \nmonotherapy with either chelator is adequate or when serum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l. Limited data \nare available on the combined use of deferiprone and deferasirox, and caution should be applied when \nconsidering the use of such combination. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet and that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take medicinal \nproducts known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause agranulocytosis (see section \n4.3). \n \nSince deferiprone binds to metallic cations, the potential exists for interactions between deferiprone \nand trivalent cation-dependent medicinal products such as aluminium-based antacids. Therefore, it is \nnot recommended to concomitantly ingest aluminium-based antacids and deferiprone. \n \nThe safety of concurrent use of deferiprone and vitamin C has not been formally studied. Based on the \nreported adverse interaction that can occur between deferoxamine and vitamin C, caution should be \nused when administering deferiprone and vitamin C concurrently. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of deferiprone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy due to the clastogenic and \nteratogenic properties of the medicinal product. These women should be advised to take contraceptive \nmeasures and must be advised to immediately stop taking deferiprone if they become pregnant or plan \nto become pregnant (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether deferiprone is excreted in human milk. No prenatal and postnatal reproductive \nstudies have been conducted in animals. Deferiprone must not be used by breast-feeding mothers. If \ntreatment is unavoidable, breast-feeding must be stopped (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nNo effects on fertility or early embryonic development were noted in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions reported during therapy with deferiprone in clinical trials were \nnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and chromaturia, which were reported in more than 10% of \npatients. The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with deferiprone was \nagranulocytosis, defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5 x 109/l, which occurred in \napproximately 1% of patients. Less severe episodes of neutropenia were reported in approximately 5% \nof patients. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reaction frequencies: Very common (≥1/10), Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data). \n \nSYSTEM ORGAN CLASS VERY COMMON \n\n(≥1/10) \nCOMMON \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nFREQUENCY \nNOT KNOWN \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Neutropenia \nAgranulocytosis \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders   Hypersensitivity \nreactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Increased appetite  \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache  \nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea \n\nAbdominal pain \nVomiting \n\nDiarrhoea  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rash \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Arthralgia  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Chromaturia   \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Fatigue  \n\nInvestigations  Increased liver \nenzymes \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with deferiprone is agranulocytosis \n(neutrophils <0.5 x 109/l), with an incidence of 1.1% (0.6 cases per 100 patient-years of treatment) \n(see section 4.4). Data from pooled clinical studies in patients with systemic iron overload show that \n63% of the episodes of agranulocytosis occurred within the first six months of treatment, 74% within \nthe first year and 26% after one year of therapy. The median time to onset of the first episode of \nagranulocytosis was 190 days (ranged 22 days- 17.6 years) and median duration was 10 days in \nclinical trials. A fatal outcome was observed in 8.3% of the reported episodes of agranulocytosis from \nclinical trials and post-marketing experience. \n \nThe observed incidence of the less severe form of neutropenia (neutrophils <1.5 x 109/l) is 4.9% (2.5 \ncases per 100 patient-years). This rate should be considered in the context of the underlying elevated \nincidence of neutropenia in thalassaemia patients, particularly in those with hypersplenism. \n \nEpisodes of diarrhoea, mostly mild and transient, have been reported in patients treated with \ndeferiprone. Gastrointestinal effects are more frequent at the beginning of therapy and resolve in most \npatients within a few weeks without the discontinuation of treatment. In some patients it may be \nbeneficial to reduce the dose of deferiprone and then scale it back up to the former dose. Arthropathy \nevents, which ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe arthritis with effusion and \nsignificant disability, have also been reported in patients treated with deferiprone. Mild arthropathies \nare generally transient. \n \nIncreased levels of serum liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking deferiprone. In the \nmajority of these patients, the increase was asymptomatic and transient, and returned to baseline \nwithout discontinuation or decreasing the dose of deferiprone (see section 4.4). \n \nSome patients experienced progression of fibrosis associated with an increase in iron overload or \nhepatitis C. \n \nLow plasma zinc levels have been associated with deferiprone in a minority of patients. The levels \nnormalised with oral zinc supplementation. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nNeurological disorders (such as cerebellar symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor \nslowdown, hand movements and axial hypotonia) have been observed in children who had been \nvoluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for \nseveral years. Episodes of hypotonia, instability, inability to walk, and hypertonia with inability of \nlimb movement have been reported in children in the post-marketing setting with standard doses of \ndeferiprone. The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.9). \n \nThe safety profile of combination therapy (deferiprone and deferoxamine) observed in clinical trials, \npost-marketing experience or published literature was consistent with that characterized for \nmonotherapy. \n \nData from the pooled safety database from clinical trials (1343 patient-years exposure to deferiprone \nmonotherapy and 244 patient-years exposure to deferiprone and deferoxamine) showed statistically \nsignificant (p<0.05) differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on System Organ Class for \n“Cardiac disorders”, “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and “Renal and urinary \ndisorders”. The incidences of “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and “Renal and \nurinary disorders” were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence \nof “Cardiac disorders” was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of \n“Cardiac disorders” reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the \nhigher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. \nCareful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe incidences of adverse reactions experienced by 18 children and 97 adults treated with combination \ntherapy were not significantly different between the two age groups except in the incidence of \narthropathy (11.1% in children vs. none in adults, p=0.02). Evaluation of rate of reactions per \n100 patient-years of exposure showed that only the rate of diarrhoea was significantly higher in \nchildren (11.1) than in adults (2.0, p=0.01). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of acute overdose have been reported. However, neurological disorders (such as cerebellar \nsymptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor slowdown, hand movements and axial \nhypotonia) have been observed in children who had been voluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times \nthe maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for several years. The neurological disorders \nprogressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation. \n \nIn case of overdose, close clinical supervision of the patient is required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron chelating agents, ATC code: V03AC02 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe active substance is deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one), a bidentate ligand which \nbinds iron in a 3:1 molar ratio. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nClinical studies have demonstrated that deferiprone is effective in promoting iron excretion and that a \ndose of 25 mg/kg three times per day can prevent the progression of iron accumulation as assessed by \nserum ferritin, in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. Data from the published literature \non iron balance studies in patients with thalassaemia major show that the use of deferiprone \nconcurrently with deferoxamine (co-administration of both chelators during the same day, either \nsimultaneously or sequentially, e.g., deferiprone during the day and deferoxamine during the night), \npromotes greater iron excretion than either drug alone. Doses of deferiprone in those studies ranged \nfrom 50 to 100 mg/kg/day and doses of deferoxamine from 40 to 60 mg/kg/day. However, chelation \ntherapy may not necessarily protect against iron-induced organ damage. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nStudies LA16-0102, LA-01 and LA08-9701 compared the efficacy of deferiprone with that of \ndeferoxamine in controlling serum ferritin in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Deferiprone \nand deferoxamine were equivalent in promoting a net stabilization or reduction of body iron load, \ndespite the continuous transfusional iron administration in those patients (no difference in proportion \nof patients with a negative trend in serum ferritin between the two treatment groups by regression \nanalysis; p>0.05). \n \nStudy LA37-1111 was conducted to evaluate the effect of single therapeutic (33 mg/kg) and \nsupratherapeutic (50 mg/kg) oral doses of deferiprone on the cardiac QT interval duration in healthy \nsubjects. The maximum difference between the LS means of the therapeutic dose and placebo was \n3.01 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 5.01 ms), and between the LS means of the supratherapeutic dose and \nplacebo was 5.23 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 7.19 ms). Deferiprone was concluded to produce no \nsignificant prolongation of the QT interval. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nDeferiprone is rapidly absorbed from the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum \nconcentration occurs 45 to 60 minutes following a single dose in fasted patients. This may be extended \nto 2 hours in fed patients. \n \nFollowing a dose of 25 mg/kg, lower peak serum concentrations have been detected in patients in the \nfed state (85 µmol/l) than in the fasting state (126 µmol/l), although there was no decrease in the \namount of deferiprone absorbed when it was given with food. \n \nBiotransformation \nDeferiprone is metabolised predominantly to a glucuronide conjugate. This metabolite lacks iron-\nbinding capability due to inactivation of the 3-hydroxy group of deferiprone. Peak serum \nconcentrations of the glucuronide occur 2 to 3 hours after administration of deferiprone. \n \nElimination \nIn humans, deferiprone is eliminated mainly via the kidneys; 75% to 90% of the ingested dose is \nreported as being recovered in the urine in the first 24 hours, in the form of free deferiprone, the \nglucuronide metabolite and the iron-deferiprone complex. A variable amount of elimination via the \nfaeces has been reported. The elimination half-life in most patients is 2 to 3 hours. \n \nRenal impairment \nAn open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of \nimpaired renal function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral \ndose of deferiprone. Subjects were categorized into 4 groups based on estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR): healthy volunteers (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2), mild renal impairment (eGFR \n60-89 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73m2), and severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73m2). Systemic exposure to deferiprone and to its metabolite \ndeferiprone 3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters Cmax and AUC. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nRegardless of the degree of renal impairment, the majority of the dose of deferiprone was excreted in \nthe urine over the first 24 hours as deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide. No significant effect of renal \nimpairment was seen on systemic exposure to deferiprone. Systemic exposure to the inactive 3-O-\nglucuronide increased with decreasing eGFR. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the \ndeferiprone dosage regimen is required in patients with impaired renal function. The safety and \npharmacokinetics of deferiprone in patients with end stage renal disease is unknown. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAn open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of \nimpaired hepatic function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral \ndose of deferiprone. Subjects were categorized into 3 groups based on the Child-Pugh classification \nscore: healthy volunteers, mild hepatic impairment (Class A: 5– 6 points), and moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Class B: 7– 9 points). Systemic exposure to deferiprone and to its metabolite deferiprone \n3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters Cmax and AUC. Deferiprone AUCs did not differ \nbetween treatment groups, but Cmax was decreased by 20% in mildly or moderately hepatically \nimpaired subjects compared with healthy volunteers. Deferiprone-3-O-glucuronide AUC was \ndecreased by 10% and Cmax by 20% in mildly and moderately impaired subjects compared with \nhealthy volunteers. A serious adverse event of acute liver and renal injury was seen in one subject with \nmoderate hepatic impairment. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the deferiprone \ndosage regimen is required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function.  \n \nThe influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone and deferiprone \n3-O-glucuronide has not been evaluated. The safety and pharmacokinetics of deferiprone in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment is unknown. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies have been conducted in animal species including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and \nmonkeys. \n \nThe most common findings in non-iron-loaded animals at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above were \nhematologic effects such as bone marrow hypocellularity, and decreased WBC, RBC and/or platelet \ncounts in peripheral blood. \n \nAtrophy of the thymus, lymphoid tissues, and testis, and hypertrophy of the adrenals, were reported at \ndoses of 100 mg/kg/day or greater in non-iron-loaded animals. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with deferiprone. The genotoxic potential \nof deferiprone was evaluated in a set of in vitro and in vivo tests. Deferiprone did not show direct \nmutagenic properties; however, it did display clastogenic characteristics in in vitro assays and in \nanimals. \n \nDeferiprone was teratogenic and embryotoxic in reproductive studies in non-iron-loaded pregnant rats \nand rabbits at doses at least as low as 25 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility or early embryonic \ndevelopment were noted in non-iron-loaded male and female rats that received deferiprone orally at \ndoses of up to 75 mg/kg twice daily for 28 days (males) or 2 weeks (females) prior to mating and until \ntermination (males) or through early gestation (females). In females, an effect on the oestrous cycle \ndelayed time to confirmed mating at all doses tested. \n \nNo prenatal and postnatal reproductive studies have been conducted in animals. \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.

Ask you doctor \nwhich method is best for you. If you become \npregnant while taking Deferiprone Lipomed, stop \ntaking the medicine immediately and tell your \ndoctor. Do not take Deferiprone Lipomed if you \nare breast-feeding. \n\n((Inside 1)) \n \nMonitoring your white blood cell count with \nDeferiprone Lipomed \n \nThere is a small chance that you may develop \nagranulocytosis (very low white blood cell count) \nwhile taking Deferiprone Lipomed, which may \nlead to a serious infection. Even though \nagranulocytosis only affects 1 to 2 out of 100 \nusers, it is important to monitor your blood on a \nregular basis. \n\n((Inside 2)) \n \nMake sure you do the following: \n \n1. Have your blood monitored on a weekly basis \nfor the first one year of treatment with \ndeferiprone and as regularly as your doctor \nrecommends thereafter. \n \n2. If you get any symptoms of infection such as \nfever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, \nimmediately seek medical attention. Your white \nblood cell count must be checked within 24 hours \nin order to detect potential agranulocytosis. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB. PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nDeferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets \ndeferiprone \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n- Provided in the folding box, you will find a patient/carer reminder card. You should complete \n\nand read the card carefully and carry it with you. Provide this card to your doctor if you develop \ninfection symptoms such as a fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms. \n\n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Deferiprone Lipomed is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Deferipone Lipomed \n3. How to take Deferiprone Lipomed \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Deferiprone Lipomed \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Deferiprone Lipomed is and what it is used for \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed contains the active substance deferiprone. Deferiprone Lipomed is an iron \nchelator, a type of medicine that removes excess iron from the body. \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed is used to treat iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients \nwith thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Deferiprone Lipomed \n \nDo not take Deferiprone Lipomed: \n- if you are allergic to deferiprone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6); \n- if you have a history of repeated episodes of neutropenia (low white blood cell (neutrophil) \n\ncount); \n- if you have a history of agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count); \n- if you are currently taking medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Other \n\nmedicines and Deferiprone Lipomed”); \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding; \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nThe most serious side effect that may occur while taking Deferiprone Lipomed is a very low white \nblood cell (neutrophil) count. This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has \noccurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people who have taken deferiprone in clinical studies. Because white \nblood cells help to fight infection, a low neutrophil count may place you at risk of developing a serious \nand potentially life-threatening infection. To monitor for neutropenia, your doctor will ask you to have \na blood test (to check your white blood cell count) performed regularly, as frequently as every week, \nwhile you are being treated with Deferiprone Lipomed. It is very important for you to keep all of these \nappointments. Please refer to the patient/carer reminder card provided in the folding box. If you get \nany symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, immediately seek medical \nattention. Your white blood cell count must be checked within 24 hours in order to detect potential \nagranulocytosis. \n \nIf you are HIV positive or if your liver or kidney function is severely impaired, your doctor may \nrecommend additional tests. \n \nYour doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load. In addition he or she \nmight ask you to undergo liver biopsies. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Deferiprone Lipomed. \n \nOther medicines and Deferiprone Lipomed \nDo not take medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Do not take Deferiprone \nLipomed”). Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any \nother medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDo not take aluminium-based antacids at the same time as taking Deferiprone Lipomed. \n \nPlease consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking vitamin C with Deferiprone Lipomed. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or if you are trying to become pregnant. This medicine \ncould seriously harm your baby. You must use effective contraception while you are taking \nDeferiprone Lipomed. Ask your doctor which method is best for you. If you become pregnant while \ntaking Deferiprone Lipomed, stop taking the medicine immediately and tell your doctor. \n \nDo not use Deferiprone Lipomed if you are breast-feeding. Please refer to the patient/carer reminder \ncard provided in the folding box. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNot relevant. \n \nDeferiprone Lipomed contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet and that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Deferiprone Lipomed \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. The amount of Deferiprone Lipomed that you take will depend on your weight. \nThe usual dose is 25 mg/kg, 3 times per day, for a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg. The total daily dose \nshould not exceed 100 mg/kg. Take your first dose in the morning. Take your second dose midday. \nTake your third dose in the evening. Deferiprone Lipomed can be taken with or without food; \nhowever, you may find it easier to remember to take Deferiprone Lipomed if you take it with your \nmeals. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you take more Deferiprone Lipomed than you should \nThere are no reports of acute overdose with deferiprone. If you have accidentally taken more than the \nprescribed dose, you should contact your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to take Deferiprone Lipomed \nDeferiprone Lipomed will be most effective if you do not miss any doses. If you do miss one dose take \nit as soon as you remember and take your next dose at its regularly scheduled time. If you miss more \nthan one dose do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses, just continue with \nyour normal schedule. Do not change your daily dose without first talking to your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effect of Deferiprone Lipomed is a very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count. \nThis condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 \npeople who have taken deferiprone in clinical studies. A low white blood cell count can be associated \nwith a serious and potentially life-threatening infection. Report immediately to your doctor any \nsymptoms of infection such as: fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- abdominal pain \n- nausea \n- vomiting \n- reddish/brown discoloration of urine \n \nIf you experience nausea or vomiting, it may help to take your Deferiprone Lipomed with some food. \nDiscolored urine is a very common effect and is not harmful. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- low white blood cell count (agranulocytosis and neutropenia) \n- headache \n- diarrhoea \n- increase in liver enzymes \n- fatigue \n- increase in appetite \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n- allergic reactions including skin rash or hives \n \nEvents of joint pain and swelling ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe disability. In \nmost cases, the pain disappeared while patients continued taking deferiprone. \n \nAdditional side effects in children \nIn post-marketing experience with deferiprone, neurological disorders (such as tremors, walking \ndisorders, double vision, involuntary muscle contractions, problems with movement coordination) \nhave been reported in children who had been voluntarily prescribed more than double the maximum \nrecommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for several years. They recovered from these symptoms after \ndiscontinuation of deferiprone. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\n \n5.
