NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPhotoBarr 15 mg powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 15 mg porfimer sodium. After reconstitution, each ml solution contains 2.5 mg \nporfimer sodium. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \nA dark red to reddish brown lyophilised powder or cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) with PhotoBarr is indicated for ablation of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) \nin patients with Barrett's Oesophagus (BO). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPhotodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr should be performed only by, or under the supervision of, a \nphysician with experience in endoscopic laser procedures. The medicinal product should only be \nadministered when material and personnel experienced in evaluating and treating anaphylaxis are \nimmediately available. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of PhotoBarr is 2 mg/kg body weight.  \n \nReconstituted PhotoBarr solution (ml) = Patient's weight (kg) x 2 mg/kg = 0.8 x patient's weight \n\n2.5 mg/ml \n \nAfter reconstitution, PhotoBarr is a dark red to reddish brown, opaque solution. \n \nOnly a solution without particles should be used and without visible signs of deterioration. \n \nPhotodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr is a two-stage process requiring administration of both \nmedicinal product and light. One course of PDT consists of one injection plus one or two light \napplications.  \n \nIn case of persistence of HGD, further treatment courses (up to a maximum of three courses) may be \ngiven (separated by a minimum of 90 days) to increase the response rate. This has to be balanced \nagainst the increased rate of stricture formation (see section 4.8 and section 5.1). \n \nProgression to cancer was related to the number of PDT courses administered. Patients who received \none course of PDT had a greater risk of progression to cancer than patients who received two or three \ncourses of PDT (50% vs. 39% and 11% respectively) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 3\n\n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6.  \n \nPhysicians should be trained in the use of PDT. The first stage of PDT is the slow intravenous \ninjection of PhotoBarr. The second stage of therapy is illumination with laser light 40-50 hours \nfollowing injection with PhotoBarr. Patients may receive a second laser light application 96-120 hours \nafter administration.  \n \nPhotoBarr should be administered as a single slow intravenous injection over 3 to 5 minutes. If \naccidentally injected paravenously there may be damage to paravenous tissue. Therefore, care should \nbe taken to prevent extravasation at the injection site. If extravasation does occur, the area should be \nprotected from light for a minimum of 90 days. There is no known benefit from injecting the \nextravasation site with another substance. \n \nApproximately 40-50 hours after PhotoBarr administration, light should be delivered by a fibre optic \ndiffuser passed through the central channel of a centring balloon. The choice of fibre optic/balloon \ndiffuser combination will depend on the length of oesophagus to be treated (Table 1). \n \nTable 1.

The objective is to expose and treat all \nareas of HGD and the entire length of BO. The light dose administered will be 130 Joules/cm (J/cm) of \ndiffuser length using a centring balloon. Based on preclinical studies, acceptable light intensity for the \nballoon/diffuser combination ranges from 175-270 mW/cm of diffuser. \n \nTo calculate the light dose, the following specific light dosimetry equation applies for all fibre optic \ndiffusers:   \n \nThe light dose (J/cm) =  power output from diffuser (W) x treatment time (sec) \n\n    Diffuser length (cm) \n \nTable 2 provides the settings that would be used to deliver the dose within the shortest time (light \nintensity of 270 mW/cm). A second option (light intensity of 200 mW/cm) has also been included \nwhere necessary to accommodate lasers with a total capacity that does not exceed 2.5 W. \n \nTable 2.

Note: No more than 1.5 times the required diffuser power output should be needed from \nthe laser. If more than this is required, the system should be checked. \n \nShort fibre optic diffusers (< 2.5 cm) are to be used to pretreat nodules with 50 J/cm diffuser length \nprior to regular balloon treatment in the first laser light session or for the retreatment of \"skip\" areas \nafter the first light session. For this treatment, the fibre optic diffuser is used without a balloon, and a \nlight intensity of 400 mW/cm should be used. Table 3 lists appropriate fibre optic power outputs and \ntreatment times using a light intensity of 400 mW/cm. \n \nTable 3.

Note: No more than 1.5 times the required diffuser power \noutput should be needed from the laser. If more than this is required, the system should \nbe checked. \n\n \nFirst light application \nA maximum of 7 cm of Barrett's mucosa is treated at the first light session using an appropriate size of \ncentering balloon and fibre optic diffuser (Table 1). Whenever possible, the segment selected for the \nfirst light application should include all the areas of HGD. Also, whenever possible, the BO segment \nselected for the first light applications should include normal tissue margin of a few millimetre at the \nproximal and distal ends. Nodules are to be pre-treated at a light doses of 50 J/cm of diffuser length \nwith a short (< 2.5 cm) fibre optic diffuser placed directly against the nodules followed by standard \nballoon application as described above. \n \nRepeat light application \nA second laser light application may be given to a previously treated segment that shows a 'skip' area, \n(i.e., an area that does not show sufficient mucosal response) using a short < 2.5 cm fibre optic diffuser \nat the light dose of 50 J/cm of diffuser length (see Table 3). The treatment regimen is summarized in \nTable 4.  Patients with BO > 7 cm, should have the remaining untreated length of Barrett's epithelium \ntreated with a second PDT course at least 90 days later. \n \nTable 4.

Both residual and additional segments may be treated in the same light session(s) \nif the total length of the segments treated with the balloon/diffuser combination is not greater than 7 \ncm. In the case of a previously treated oesophageal segment, if it has not sufficiently healed and/or \nhistological assessment of biopsies is not clear, the subsequent course of PDT may be delayed for an \nadditional 1-2 months. \n \nSpecial care to ensure accurate PhotoBarr dosing and/or light dose is crucial, since miscalculation of \neither medicinal product or light dose may lead to a less effective treatment or cause detrimental effect \nto the patient. Photodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr should be applied by physicians trained in \nendoscopic use of PDT and only in those facilities properly equipped for the procedure. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients \n PhotoBarr is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nDose modification based upon age is not required. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe influence of renal impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated (see section \n4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nThe influence of hepatic impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated (see \nsection 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, other porphyrins or to any of the excipients. \n \nPorphyria.  \n \nSevere renal and/or hepatic impairment. \n \nOesophageal or gastric varices or patients with oesophageal ulcers >1 cm in diameter. \n \nTracheo-oesophageal or broncho-oesophageal fistula. \n \nSuspected erosion of major blood vessels due to risk of massive, potentially fatal haemorrhage. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy and especially safety of PDT with PhotoBarr have not been established in patients with \ncontraindications to, or not being eligible for, oesophagectomy. Photodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr \nhas exclusively been studied in patients not suffering from severe medical conditions, such as \ncongestive heart failure of advanced stage or serious pulmonary conditions that might impair the \neligibility of patients for surgical procedures. \n \nIn clinical trials, PhotoBarr PDT has only been tested in patients being treatment naive concerning \nmucosal ablative therapy. Safety and efficacy in patients with treatment failure of other local mucosal \nablative therapy has not been evaluated. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 6\n\nElderly \nPatients older than 75 years may be at a higher risk of respiratory related adverse events such as \npleural effusion and dyspnoea. \n \nPulmonary or cardiac disorders \nPatients with pulmonary or cardiac medical illness or a history of such illness should be treated with \ncaution. These patients may be at higher risk for the development of cardiac and pulmonary related \nadverse events such as heart rhythm disorders, angina pectoris, dyspnoea, cough, pleural effusion, \npharyngitis, atelectasis and events like dehydration (see also section 4.8). \n \nPhotosensitivity \nAll patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid \nexposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light (from examination lamps, including \ndental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity, neon lights, etc.) for at \nleast 90 days after treatment, as some patients may remain photosensitive for up to 90 days or more.   \nDuring this period, patients should wear dark sunglasses, which have an average white light \ntransmittance of < 4% when outdoors. The photosensitivity is due to residual photoactive substances, \nwhich will be present in all parts of the skin. Exposure of the skin to ambient indoor light is, however, \nbeneficial because the remaining medicinal product will be inactivated gradually through a photo-\nbleaching reaction. Therefore, patients should not stay in a darkened room during this period and \nshould be encouraged to expose their skin to ambient indoor light. The level of photosensitivity will \nvary for different areas of the body, depending on the extent of previous exposure to light.  \nBefore exposing any area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light, the patient should test it for \nresidual photosensitivity. A small area of skin should be exposed to sunlight for 10 minutes. The tissue \naround the eyes may be more sensitive, and therefore, it is not recommended that the face be used for \ntesting. If no photosensitivity reaction (erythema, oedema, blistering) occurs within 24 hours, the \npatient can gradually resume normal outdoor activities, initially continuing to exercise caution and \ngradually allowing increased exposure. If some photosensitivity reaction occurs with the limited skin \ntest, the patient should continue exercising precautions for another 2 weeks before retesting.  \nIf patients travel to a different geographical area with greater sunshine, they should retest their level of \nphotosensitivity. Conventional UV (ultraviolet) sunscreens are of no value in protecting against \nphotosensitivity reactions because photoactivation is caused by visible light. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo pharmacokinetic and safety data in patients with hepatic impairment are available. Based on \nevidence for a primarily hepatic/biliary elimination of photoactive substances, severity of phototoxic \nreactions and duration of the period of photosensitivity in patients with any grade of hepatic \nimpairment may be increased.  PhotoBarr is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be clearly instructed that the \nperiod requiring the precautionary measures described below may be longer than 90 days.   \n \nOcular sensitivity \nPatients should be advised to consult their ophthalmologist if they notice any vision changes after \ntreatment with PhotoBarr PDT. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported. In case of an allergic \nreaction, appropriate measures (standard of care) should be taken and the PDT treatment should not be \nrepeated.  The medicinal product should only be administered when material and personnel \nexperienced in evaluating and treating anaphylaxis are immediately available. \n \nNon Cardiac Chest Pain \nAs a result of PDT treatment, patients may complain of substernal chest pain because of inflammatory \nresponses within the area of treatment. Such pain may be of sufficient intensity to warrant the short-\nterm prescription of opiate analgesics. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 7\n\nOesophageal Stenosis \nProphylactic use of corticosteroids to reduce stricture formation should be avoided during PDT as its \nuse has shown not to reduce, and may worsen, stricture formation.  \n \nNutrition in Patients \nPhotoBarr PDT regularly causes dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea and vomiting. Therefore, patients \nshould be advised to receive liquid food during the first days (up to 4 weeks) after the laser light \napplication. If intake of food and/or drink becomes impossible or repeated vomiting occurs, patients \nshould be advised to return to the clinic for evaluation and to receive intravenous fluids if needed. \n \nUse Before or After Radiotherapy \nIf PDT is to be used before or after radiotherapy, sufficient time should be allowed between the \ntherapies to ensure that the inflammatory reaction produced by the first treatment has subsided prior to \ncommencement of the second treatment.  \n \nThrombo-embolism \nThere may be an increase in the risk of thrombo-embolic events especially in patients with \nprolonged immobilization, post major surgery and other thromboembolic risk factors. \nFollow-up procedure \nData on the long-term effect of PhotoBarr (beyond two years) are not available at the moment. Also, \ntreating physicians should be aware of the possibility of squamous overgrowth and the risk of \noverlooking cancer. Therefore, adequate and rigorous surveillance should be continued despite \npossible endoscopic partial or complete restitution of the normal squamous mucosa. In the clinical \nstudies with PhotoBarr, follow-up surveillance was done every three months, or every six months after \nfour consecutive biopsy results had shown no more high-grade dysplasia (see section 5.1). Available \ntreatment and surveillance guidelines should be considered. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed with PhotoBarr investigating pharmacokinetic \ninteractions with other medicinal products.  \n \nA study investigating pharmacodynamic interactions has demonstrated that corticosteroids given \nbefore or concomitant with PDT to decrease formation of strictures may decrease the safety of \ntreatment. \n \nIt is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising agents (e.g., tetracyclines, sulphonamides, \nphenothiazines, sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin and \nfluoroquinolones) could increase the photosensitivity reaction. \n \nPhotoBarr PDT causes direct intracellular damage by initiating radical chain reactions that damage \nintracellular membranes and mitochondria. Tissue damage also results from ischaemia secondary to \nvasoconstriction, platelet activation and aggregation and clotting. Research in animals and in cell \nculture has suggested that many active substances could influence the effects of PDT, possible \nexamples of which are described below. There are no human data available to support or rebut these \npossibilities. Compounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals, such as dimethyl \nsulphoxide, b-carotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol would be expected to decrease PDT activity. \nPreclinical data also suggest that tissue ischaemia, allopurinol, calcium channel blockers and some \nprostaglandin synthesis inhibitors could interfere with PhotoBarr PDT. Medicinal products that \ndecrease clotting, vasoconstriction or platelet aggregation, e.g., thromboxane A2 inhibitors, could \ndecrease the efficacy of PDT.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 8\n\n \n4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies available for porfimer sodium. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition and postnatal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Porfimer sodium should not \nbe used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. Women of child-bearing potential should use \neffective contraception before, during and for at least 90 days after treatment. \n \nLactation \nIt is not known whether porfimer sodium is excreted into human breast milk. In rats, porfimer sodium \npassed into breast milk. Breast-feeding should be terminated prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nFor the PDT procedure, sedation may be required, and consequently caution should be taken. Patients \nshould not drive or use machines after the light treatment if they have been sedated for the procedure. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nAll patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid \nsunlight and bright indoor light (see section 4.4). In an open label pharmacokinetic study, all \n24 healthy subjects experienced photosensitivity reactions, which were characteristically represented \nby erythematous rash and oedema and were mild to moderate in intensity. The photosensitivity \nreactions occurred primarily on the face, hands, and neck regions, which are the areas of the skin that \nare most susceptible to accidental sunlight exposure. Other less common skin manifestations were \nreported in areas where photosensitivity reactions had occurred, such as increased hair growth, skin \ndiscolouration, skin nodules, skin wrinkling and skin fragility. These manifestations may be \nattributable to a pseudoporphyria state (temporary medicinal product-induced cutaneous porphyria). \nThe frequency and nature of the photosensitivity reactions experienced in this study are unlike the \ndocumented incidence seen in previous clinical studies in cancer patients (approx. 20%) or the \nspontaneously reported incidence from commercial use of PhotoBarr (< 20%). It is possible that \nprolonged exposure to light at the clinical research unit or accidental sunlight exposure after discharge \nmay be responsible for the high frequency of photosensitivity reactions. The more active lifestyle of \nthe healthy and relatively younger subjects compared with cancer patients may have been a \ncontributing factor to these photosensitivity reactions. \n \nPhotoBarr PDT plus omeprazole (PDT + OM) treatment was compared to a group treated with \nomeprazole alone (OM only), in the BO with HGD controlled clinical trial. In the PDT + OM group, \n133 patients were treated. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were photosensitivity \nreactions (69%), oesophageal stenosis (40%), vomiting (32%), chest pain of non-cardiac origin (20%), \npyrexia (20%), dysphagia (19%), constipation (13%), dehydration (12%) and nausea (11%). The \nmajority of these reported adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. \n \nb.Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed below in Table 5 by organ class and frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (>1/10); common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1000, <1/100); not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 9\n\n \nTable 5.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nOf the serious adverse events (SAEs) in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group, 44 (23.1%) were considered \nassociated with the treatment. The most frequently reported treatment-associated serious adverse \nreaction (SAR) was dehydration (4%), experienced by 5 patients. The majority of the SARs were \ngastrointestinal disorders (8% - 11 patients), specifically nausea (3% - 4 patients), vomiting (3% - 4 \npatients) and upper abdominal pain (2% - 2 patients). \n \nThe majority of treatment-associated oesophageal stenosis (which includes oesophageal narrowing and \noesophageal strictures) reported in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group were of mild or moderate intensity \n(92%). All incidences of strictures were considered associated with treatment of which 1% was \nconsidered serious.  \n \nAn occurrence rate of 12% for oesophageal strictures was observed during the first course of \ntreatment. The occurrence rate rose to 32% when a second course of therapy was given, especially in \nthe areas where second treatment overlaps the first and amounted to 10% for those who received a \nthird treatment course. The majority of these was mild to moderate in intensity and could be managed \nthrough 1-2 dilatations. Eight percent were severe, requiring multiple (6 - >10) dilatations. The \nformation of oesophageal stenosis cannot be reduced or eliminated by the use of steroids. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 11\n\n \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nPhotoBarr  \nThere is no information on overdose of PhotoBarr. The recommended 2 mg/kg dose, instead of the \nrecommended single administration, was given twice two days apart (10 patients) and three times \nwithin two weeks (1 patient), without any notable adverse reactions being reported. The effects of an \noverdose on the duration of photosensitivity are unknown. Laser treatment should not be given if an \noverdose of PhotoBarr is administered. In the event of an overdose, patients should protect their eyes \nand skin from direct sunlight or bright indoor lights for 90 days. At this time, patients should test for \nresidual photosensitivity (see section 4.4).  \nPorfimer sodium is not dialyzable. \n \nLaser light \nLight doses of two to three times the recommended dose have been administered to a few patients with \nsuperficial endobronchial tumours. One patient experienced life-threatening dyspnoea and the others \nhad no notable complications. Increased symptoms and damage to normal tissue might be expected \nfollowing an overdose of light. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sensitizers used in photodynamic/radiation therapy, ATC code: \nL01XD01 \n \nMechanism of action \nPorfimer sodium is a mixture of porphyrin units, which are linked together in chains of two to eight \nunits The cytotoxic actions of porfimer sodium are light and oxygen-dependent. Photodynamic \ntherapy with PhotoBarr is a 2-stage process. The first stage is the intravenous injection of PhotoBarr. \nClearance from a variety of tissues occurs over 40-72 hours, but tumours, skin, and organs of the \nreticuloendothelial system (including liver and spleen) retain porfimer sodium for a longer period. \nIllumination of the target area with 630 nm wavelength laser light constitutes the second stage of \ntherapy. Tumour and dysplastic tissue selectivity in treatment may occur partly through selective \nretention of porfimer sodium but mainly through a selective delivery of light. Cellular damage caused \nby porfimer sodium PDT is a consequence of the propagation of free radical reactions. Radical \ninitiation may occur after porfimer sodium absorbs light to form a porphyrin excited state. Spin \ntransfer from porfimer sodium to molecular oxygen may then generate singlet oxygen. Subsequent \nfree radical reactions can form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Tumour cell death also occurs \nthrough ischaemic necrosis secondary to vascular occlusion that appears to be partly mediated by \nthromboxane A2 release. The laser treatment induces a photochemical, not a thermal, effect. The \nnecrotic reaction and associated inflammatory response evolve over several days. \n \nClinical efficacy \nIn a controlled clinical trial, a PhotoBarr PDT + OM (omeprazole) patient group (n=183)was \ncompared to a group of patients receiving OM only (n=70). Eligible patients for this study were to \nhave biopsy-proven HGD in Barrett's oesophagus (BO). Patients were excluded from the study if there \nwas a presence of invasive oesophageal cancer, if they had a history of cancer other than non-\nmelanoma skin cancer or if they had received prior PDT to the oesophagus. Other exclusion criteria \nwere patients in whom omeprazole therapy was contraindicated. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 12\n\nPatients randomised to treatment with PDT received PhotoBarr at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight \nthrough slow intravenous injection over 3 to 5 minutes. One or 2 laser light treatments were \nadministered following PhotoBarr injection. The first laser light session occurred 40-50 hours after \ninjection and a second session, if indicated, occurred 96-120 hours after injection. Co-administration \nof omeprazole (20 mg BID) began at least 2 days before PhotoBarr injection. Patients randomised to \nthe OM only group received orally omeprazole 20 mg BID for the duration of the study.   \n \nPatients were followed every 3 months until 4 consecutive, quarterly follow-up endoscopic biopsy \nresults were negative for HGD, and then biannually until the last enrolled patient had completed a \nminimum of 24 months of follow-up evaluations after randomisation.    \n \nPhotoBarr PDT + OM was effective in eliminating HGD in patients with BO. At final analysis, \nperformed at a minimum of 24 months follow-up, a statistically significant percentage of patients \n(77%) in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group demonstrated complete HGD ablation compared to 39% of \npatients in the OM alone group (p<0.0001). Fifty-two percent of patients in the PDT + OM group \nshowed normal squamous cell epithelium while 59% had absence of dysplasia compared to 7% and \n14% in the OM alone group, respectively (p<0.0001). These results confirm those observed after a \nminimum of 6 months follow-up which showed HGD ablation in 72% of patients in the PhotoBarr \nPDT + OM group compared to 31% in the OM only group. Forty-one percent of patients showed \nnormal squamous cell epithelium and 49% had absence of dysplasia. \n \nBy the end of the minimum follow-up of two years, 13% in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group had \nprogressed to cancer compared to 28% in the OM only group in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. \nThe proportion of patients who progressed to cancer in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group was \nstatistically lower than in the OM only group (p=0.0060). The survival curves indicated that, by the \nend of the entire follow-up period, patients in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group had a 83% chance of \nbeing cancer-free as compared to a 53% chance for patients in the OM only group. Comparison \nbetween the survival curves of the two treatment arms using the log rank test showed a statistically \nsignificant difference between the curves of the two groups in the ITT population (p=0.0014), \nindicating a significant delay in the progression to cancer. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of porfimer sodium have been studied in 12 patients with endobronchial cancer \nand 23 healthy subjects (11 men and 12 women), given 2 mg/kg porfimer sodium  through slow \nintravenous injection. Plasma samples were obtained out to 56 days (patients) or 36 days (volunteers) \npost-injection.  \n \nIn patients, the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 79.6 \u03bcg/ml (CV 61%, range 39-222), \nwhereas in volunteers Cmax was 40 \u03bcg/ml and AUCinf was 2400 \u03bcg/h/ml. \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro binding of porfimer sodium to human serum protein is around 90% and independent of \nconcentration between 20 and 100 \u03bcg/ml. \n \nElimination \nPorfimer sodium is cleared slowly from the body, with a mean CLT of 0.859 ml/h/kg (CV 53%) in \npatients. The serum decay was bi-exponential, with a slow distribution phase and a very long \nelimination phase that started approximately 24 hours after injection. The mean elimination half-life \n(t1/2) was 21.5 days (CV 26 %, range 264-672) in patients and 17 days in volunteers.  \n \nSpecial populations \nThe influence of renal and hepatic impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated \n(see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 13\n\nGender had no effect on pharmacokinetic parameters except for tmax, which was approximately \n1.5 hours in women and 0.17 hours in men. At the time of intended photoactivation 40-50 hours after \ninjection, the pharmacokinetic profiles of porfimer sodium in men and women were very similar. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPorfimer sodium was not mutagenic in standard genotoxicity tests in the absence of light. With light \nactivation, porfimer sodium was mutagenic in some in-vitro tests.  \n \nReproductive toxicology studies were insufficient to support the safety of porfimer sodium during \npregnancy, as no light activation had been used. In these studies foetotoxicity, but not teratogenicity, \noccurred in rats and rabbits only at evaluated intravenous doses (greater than of equal to 4 mg/kg) and \nat greater frequency (daily) compared in the clinical use. \n \nPreclinical studies indicate that the excretion of porfimer sodium components occurs primarily via the \nfaecal route. \n \n \n6.

Skin and eye contact should be avoided \ndue to the potential for photosensitivity reactions upon exposure to light; use of rubber gloves and eye \nprotection is recommended.  \nPhotoBarr is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded. \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAccidental exposure  \nPhotoBarr is neither a primary ocular irritant nor a primary dermal irritant.  However, because of its \npotential to induce photosensitivity, PhotoBarr might be an eye and/or skin irritant in the presence of \nbright light.  It is important to avoid contact with the eyes and skin during preparation and/or \nadministration.  As with therapeutic overdose, any accidentally overexposed person must be protected \nfrom bright light.\u2019 \n \n7.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection. \n \nA dark red to reddish brown lyophilised powder or cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) with PhotoBarr is indicated for: \n \n- ablation of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with Barrett's Oesophagus (BO). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPhotodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr should be performed only by, or under the supervision of, a \nphysician with experience in endoscopic laser procedures. The medicinal product should only be \nadministered when material and personnel experienced in evaluating and treating anaphylaxis are \nimmediately available. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of PhotoBarr is 2 mg/kg body weight.  \n \nReconstituted PhotoBarr solution (ml) = Patient's weight (kg) x 2 mg/kg = 0.8 x patient's weight \n\n2.5 mg/ml \n \nAfter reconstitution, PhotoBarr is a dark red to reddish brown, opaque solution. \n \nOnly a solution without particles should be used and without visible signs of deterioration. \n \nPhotodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr is a two-stage process requiring administration of both \nmedicinal product and light. One course of PDT consists of one injection plus one or two light \napplications.  \n \nIn case of persistence of HGD, further treatment courses (up to a maximum of three courses) may be \ngiven (separated by a minimum of 90 days) to increase the response rate. This has to be balanced \nagainst the increased rate of stricture formation (see section 4.8 and section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 17\n\nProgression to cancer was related to the number of PDT courses administered. Patients who received \none course of PDT had a greater risk of progression to cancer than patients who received two or three \ncourses of PDT (50% vs. 39% and 11% respectively) \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on reconstitution prior to administration, see section 6.6 \n \nPhysicians should be trained in the use of PDT. The first stage of PDT is the slow intravenous \ninjection of PhotoBarr. The second stage of therapy is illumination with laser light 40-50 hours \nfollowing injection with PhotoBarr. Patients may receive a second laser light application 96-120 hours \nafter administration.  \n \n PhotoBarr should be administered as a single slow intravenous injection over 3 to 5 minutes at 2 \nmg/kg body weight. If accidentally injected paravenously there may be damage to paravenous tissue. \nTherefore, care should be taken to prevent extravasation at the injection site. If extravasation does \noccur, the area should be protected from light for a minimum of 90 days. There is no known benefit \nfrom injecting the extravasation site with another substance. \n \nApproximately 40-50 hours after PhotoBarr administration, light should be delivered by a fibre optic \ndiffuser passed through the central channel of a centring balloon. The choice of fibre optic/balloon \ndiffuser combination will depend on the length of oesophagus to be treated (Table 1). \n \nTable 1.

The objective is to expose and treat all \nareas of HGD and the entire length of BO. The light dose administered will be 130 Joules/cm (J/cm) of \ndiffuser length using a centring balloon. Based on preclinical studies, acceptable light intensity for the \nballoon/diffuser combination ranges from 175-270 mW/cm of diffuser. \n \nTo calculate the light dose, the following specific light dosimetry equation applies for all fibre optic \ndiffusers:   \n \nThe light dose (J/cm)=  power output from diffuser (W) x treatment time (sec) \n\n    Diffuser length (cm) \n \nTable 2 provides the settings that would be used to deliver the dose within the shortest time (light \nintensity of 270 mW/cm). A second option (light intensity of 200 mW/cm) has also been included \nwhere necessary to accommodate lasers with a total capacity that does not exceed 2.5 W. \n \nTable 2.

For this treatment, the fibre optic diffuser is used without a balloon, and a \nlight intensity of 400 mW/cm should be used. Table 3 lists appropriate fibre optic power outputs and \ntreatment times using a light intensity of 400 mW/cm. \n \nTable 3.

Note: No more than 1.5 times the required diffuser power \noutput should be needed from the laser. If more than this is required, the system should \nbe checked. \n\n \nFirst light application \nA maximum of 7 cm of Barrett's mucosa is treated at the first light session using an appropriate size of \ncentering balloon and fibre optic diffuser (Table 1). Whenever possible, the segment selected for the \nfirst light application should include all the areas of HGD. Also, whenever possible, the BO segment \nselected for the first light applications should include normal tissue margin of a few millimetre at the \nproximal and distal ends. Nodules are to be pre-treated at a light doses of 50 J/cm of diffuser length \nwith a short (< 2.5 cm) fibre optic diffuser placed directly against the nodules followed by standard \nballoon application as described above. \n \nRepeat light application \nA second laser light application may be given to a previously treated segment that shows a 'skip' area, \n(i.e., an area that does not show sufficient mucosal response) using a short < 2.5 cm fibre optic diffuser \nat the light dose of 50 J/cm of diffuser length (see Table 3). The treatment regimen is summarized in \nTable 4. Patients with BO > 7 cm, should have the remaining untreated length of Barrett's epithelium \ntreated with a second PDT course at least 90 days later. \n \nTable 4.

Both residual and additional segments may be treated in the same light session(s) \nif the total length of the segments treated with the balloon/diffuser combination is not greater than 7 \ncm. In the case of a previously treated oesophageal segment, if it has not sufficiently healed and/or \nhistological assessment of biopsies is not clear, the subsequent course of PDT may be delayed for an \nadditional 1-2 months. \n \nSpecial care to ensure accurate PhotoBarr dosing and/or light dose is crucial, since miscalculation of \neither medicinal product or light dose may lead to a less effective treatment or cause detrimental effect \nto the patient. Photodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr should be applied by physicians trained in \nendoscopic use of PDT and only in those facilities properly equipped for the procedure. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients \nPhotoBarr is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nElderly patients(\u2265 65 years old) \nDose modification based upon age is not required. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe influence of renal impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated. (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nThe influence of hepatic impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated (see \nsection 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other porphyrins or to any of the excipients. \n \n- Porphyria.  \n \n- Severe renal and/or hepatic impairment. \n \n- Oesophageal or gastric varices or patients with oesophageal ulcers >1 cm in diameter. \n \n- Tracheo-oesophageal or broncho-oesophageal fistula. \n \n- Suspected erosion of major blood vessels due to risk of massive, potentially fatal haemorrhage. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy and especially safety of PDT with PhotoBarr have not been established in patients with \ncontraindications to, or not being eligible for, oesophagectomy. Photodynamic therapy with PhotoBarr \nhas exclusively been studied in patients not suffering from severe medical conditions, such as \ncongestive heart failure of advanced stage or serious pulmonary conditions that might impair the \neligibility of patients for surgical procedures. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 20\n\n \nIn clinical trials, PhotoBarr PDT has only been tested in patients being treatment naive concerning \nmucosal ablative therapy. Safety and efficacy in patients with treatment failure of other local mucosal \nablative therapy has not been evaluated. \n \nElderly \nPatients older than 75 years may be at a higher risk of respiratory related adverse events such as \npleural effusion and dyspnoea \n \nPulmonary or cardiac disorders \nPatients with pulmonary or cardiac medical illness or a history of such illness should be treated with \ncaution. These patients may be at higher risk for the development of cardiac and pulmonary related \nadverse events such as heart rhythm disorders, angina pectoris, dyspnoea, cough, pleural effusion, \npharyngitis, atelectasis and events like dehydration (see also section 4.8). \n \nPhotosensitivity \nAll patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid \nexposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light (from examination lamps, including \ndental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity, neon lights, etc.) for at \nleast 90 days after treatment as some patients may remain photosensitive for up to 90 days or more.  \nDuring this period, patients should wear dark sunglasses, which have an average white light \ntransmittance of <4% when outdoors. The photosensitivity is due to residual photoactive substances, \nwhich will be present in all parts of the skin. Exposure of the skin to ambient indoor light is, however, \nbeneficial because the remaining medicinal product will be inactivated gradually through a photo-\nbleaching reaction. Therefore, patients should not stay in a darkened room during this period and \nshould be encouraged to expose their skin to ambient indoor light. The level of photosensitivity will \nvary for different areas of the body, depending on the extent of previous exposure to light. Before \nexposing any area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light, the patient should test it for residual \nphotosensitivity. A small area of skin should be exposed to sunlight for 10 minutes. The tissue around \nthe eyes may be more sensitive, and therefore, it is not recommended that the face be used for testing. \nIf no photosensitivity reaction (erythema, oedema, blistering) occurs within 24 hours, the patient can \ngradually resume normal outdoor activities, initially continuing to exercise caution and gradually \nallowing increased exposure. If some photosensitivity reaction occurs with the limited skin test, the \npatient should continue exercising precautions for another 2 weeks before retesting. If patients travel \nto a different geographical area with greater sunshine, they should retest their level of photosensitivity. \nConventional UV (ultraviolet) sunscreens are of no value in protecting against photosensitivity \nreactions because photoactivation is caused by visible light. \n \nHepatic Impairment \nNo pharmacokinetic and safety data in patients with hepatic impairment are available.  Based on \nevidence for a primarily hepatic/biliary elimination of photoactive substances, severity of phototoxic \nreactions and duration of the period of photosensitivity in patients with any grade of hepatic \nimpairment may be increased.  PhotoBarr is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment.  Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be clearly instructed that the \nperiod requiring the precautionary measures described below may be longer than 90 days.   \n \nOcular sensitivity \nPatients should be advised to consult their ophthalmologist if they notice any vision changes after \ntreatment with PhotoBarr PDT. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAcute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported. In case of an allergic \nreaction, appropriate measures (standard of care) should be taken and the PDT treatment should not be \nrepeated.  The medicinal product should only be administered when material and personnel \nexperienced in evaluating and treating anaphylaxis are immediately available. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 21\n\n \nNon Cardiac Chest Pain \nAs a result of PDT treatment, patients may complain of substernal chest pain because of inflammatory \nresponses within the area of treatment. Such pain may be of sufficient intensity to warrant the short-\nterm prescription of opiate analgesics. \n \nOesophageal Stenosis  \nProphylactic use of corticosteroids to reduce stricture formation should be avoided during PDT as its \nuse has shown not to reduce, and may worsen, stricture formation.  \n \nNutrition in Patients \nPhotoBarr PDT regularly causes dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea and vomiting. Therefore, patients \nshould be advised to receive liquid food during the first days (up to 4 weeks) after the laser light \napplication. If intake of food and/or drink becomes impossible or repeated vomiting occurs, patients \nshould be advised to return to the clinic for evaluation and to receive intravenous fluids if needed. \n \nUse Before or After Radiotherapy \nIf PDT is to be used before or after radiotherapy, sufficient time should be allowed between the \ntherapies to ensure that the inflammatory reaction produced by the first treatment has subsided prior to \ncommencement of the second treatment. \n \nThrombo-embolism \nThere may be an increase in the risk of thrombo-embolic events especially in patients with prolonged \nimmobilization, post major surgery and other thromboembolic risk factors. \n \nFollow-up procedure \nData on the long-term effect of PhotoBarr (beyond two years) are not available at the moment. Also, \ntreating physicians should be aware of the possibility of squamous overgrowth and the risk of \noverlooking cancer. \n \nTherefore, adequate and rigorous surveillance should be continued despite possible endoscopic partial \nor complete restitution of the normal squamous mucosa. \n \nIn the clinical studies with PhotoBarr, follow-up surveillance was done every three months, or every \nsix months after four consecutive biopsy results had shown no more high-grade dysplasia (see section \n5.1). \nAvailable treatment and surveillance guidelines should be considered. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed with PhotoBarr investigating pharmacokinetic \nproduct interactions with other medicinal products.  \n \nA study investigating pharmacodynamic interactions has demonstrated that corticosteroids given \nbefore or concomitant with PDT to decrease formation of strictures may decrease the safety of \ntreatment. \n \nIt is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising agents (e.g., tetracyclines, sulphonamides, \nphenothiazines, sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin and \nfluoroquinolones) could increase the photosensitivity reaction. \n \nPhotoBarr PDT causes direct intracellular damage by initiating radical chain reactions that damage \nintracellular membranes and mitochondria. Tissue damage also results from ischaemia secondary to \nvasoconstriction, platelet activation and aggregation and clotting. Research in animals and in cell \nculture has suggested that many active substances could influence the effects of PDT, possible \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 22\n\nexamples of which are described below. There are no human data available to support or rebut these \npossibilities. \n \nCompounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, b-\ncarotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol would be expected to decrease PDT activity. Preclinical data \nalso suggest that tissue ischaemia, allopurinol, calcium channel blockers and some prostaglandin \nsynthesis inhibitors could interfere with PhotoBarr PDT. Medicinal products that decrease clotting, \nvasoconstriction or platelet aggregation, e.g., thromboxane A2 inhibitors, could decrease the efficacy \nof PDT.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies available for porfimer sodium. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition and postnatal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Porfimer sodium should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \nWomen of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception before, during and for at least \n90 days after treatment. \n \nLactation \nIt is not known whether porfimer sodium is excreted into human breast milk. In rats porfimer sodium \npassed into breast milk. Breastfeeding should be terminated prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nFor the PDT procedure, sedation may be required and consequently caution should be taken. Patients \nshould not drive or use machines after the light treatment if they have been sedated for the procedure. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of safety profile \n \nAll patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid \nsunlight and bright indoor light (see section 4.4). In an open label pharmacokinetic study, all \n24 healthy subjects experienced photosensitivity reactions, which were characteristically represented \nby erythematous rash and oedema and were mild to moderate in intensity. The photosensitivity \nreactions occurred primarily on the face, hands, and neck regions, which are the areas of the skin that \nare most susceptible to accidental sunlight exposure. Other less common skin manifestations were \nreported in areas where photosensitivity reactions had occurred, such as increased hair growth, skin \ndiscolouration, skin nodules, skin wrinkling and skin fragility. These manifestations may be \nattributable to a pseudoporphyria state (temporary medicinal product-induced cutaneous porphyria). \nThe frequency and nature of the photosensitivity reactions experienced in this study are unlike the \ndocumented incidence seen in previous clinical studies in cancer patients (approx. 20%) or the \nspontaneously reported incidence from commercial use of PhotoBarr (< 20%). It is possible that \nprolonged exposure to light at the clinical research unit or accidental sunlight exposure after discharge \nmay be responsible for the high frequency of photosensitivity reactions. The more active lifestyle of \nthe healthy and relatively younger subjects compared with cancer patients may have been a \ncontributing factor to these photosensitivity reactions. \n \nPhotoBarr PDT plus omeprazole (PDT + OM) treatment was compared to a group treated with \nomeprazole alone (OM only), in the BO with HGD controlled clinical trial. In the PDT + OM group, \n133 patients were treated. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were photosensitivity \nreactions (69%), oesophageal stenosis (40%), vomiting (32%), chest pain of non-cardiac origin (20%), \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 23\n\npyrexia (20%), dysphagia (19%), constipation (13%), dehydration (12%) and nausea (11%). The \nmajority of these reported adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. \n \nb Tabulated summary of adverse events \nAdverse reactions reported are listed below in Table 5 by organ class and frequency.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nOf the serious adverse events (SAEs) in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group, 44 (23.1%) were considered \nassociated with the treatment. The most frequently reported treatment-associated serious adverse \nreaction (SAR) was dehydration (4%), experienced by 5 patients. The majority of the SAEs \nexperienced were gastrointestinal disorders (8% - 11 patients), specifically nausea (3% - 4 patients), \nvomiting (3% - 4 patients) and upper abdominal pain (2% - 2 patients). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 25\n\n \nThe majority of treatment-associated oesophageal stenosis (which includes oesophageal narrowing and \noesophageal strictures) reported in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group were of mild or moderate intensity \n(92%). All incidences of strictures were considered associated with treatment of which 1% was \nconsidered serious.  \n \nAn occurrence rate of 12% for oesophageal strictures was observed during the first course of \ntreatment. The occurrence rate rose to 32% when a second course of therapy was given, especially in \nthe areas where second treatment overlaps the first and amounted to 10% for those who received a \nthird treatment course. The majority of these was mild to moderate in intensity and could be managed \nthrough 1-2 dilatations. Eight percent were severe, requiring multiple (6 - >10) dilatations. The \nformation of oesophageal stenosis cannot be reduced or eliminated by the use of steroids. \n \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nPhotoBarr  \nThere is no information on overdose of PhotoBarr.  The recommended 2 mg/kg dose, instead of the \nrecommended single administration, was given twice two days apart (10 patients) and three times \nwithin two weeks (1 patient) without any notable adverse reactions being reported. The effects of an \noverdose on the duration of photosensitivity are unknown. Laser treatment should not be given if an \noverdose of PhotoBarr is administered. In the event of an overdose, patients should protect their eyes \nand skin from direct sunlight or bright indoor lights for 90 days. At this time, patients should test for \nresidual photosensitivity (see section 4.4). Porfimer sodium is not dialyzable. \n \nLaser light  \nLight doses of two to three times the recommended dose have been administered to a few patients with \nsuperficial endobronchial tumours. One patient experienced life-threatening dyspnoea and the others \nhad no notable complications. Increased symptoms and damage to normal tissue might be expected \nfollowing an overdose of light. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sensitizers used in photodynamic/radiation therapy, ATC code: \nL01XD01 \n \nMechanism of action \nPorfimer sodium is a mixture of porphyrin units, which are linked together in chains of two to eight \nunits. The cytotoxic actions of porfimer sodium are light and oxygen-dependent. Photodynamic \ntherapy with PhotoBarr is a 2-stage process. The first stage is the intravenous injection of PhotoBarr. \nClearance from a variety of tissues occurs over 40-72 hours, but tumours, skin, and organs of the \nreticuloendothelial system (including liver and spleen) retain porfimer sodium for a longer period. \nIllumination of the target area with 630 nm wavelength laser light constitutes the second stage of \ntherapy. Tumour and dysplastic tissue selectivity in treatment may occur partly through selective \nretention of porfimer sodium but mainly through a selective delivery of light. Cellular damage caused \nby porfimer sodium PDT is a consequence of the propagation of free radical reactions. Radical \ninitiation may occur after porfimer sodium absorbs light to form a porphyrin excited state. Spin \ntransfer from porfimer sodium to molecular oxygen may then generate singlet oxygen. Subsequent \nfree radical reactions can form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Tumour cell death also occurs \nthrough ischaemic necrosis secondary to vascular occlusion that appears to be partly mediated by \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 26\n\nthromboxane A2 release. The laser treatment induces a photochemical, not a thermal, effect. The \nnecrotic reaction and associated inflammatory response evolve over several days. \n \nClinical efficacy \nIn a controlled clinical trial, a PhotoBarr PDT + OM (omeprazole) patient group (n=183) was \ncompared to a group of patients receiving OM only (n=70). Eligible patients for this study were to \nhave biopsy-proven HGD in Barrett\u2019s oesophagus (BO). Patients were excluded from the study if \nthere was a presence of invasive oesophageal cancer, if they had a history of cancer other than non-\nmelanoma skin cancer or if they had received prior PDT to the oesophagus. Other exclusion criteria \nwere patients in whom omeprazole therapy was contraindicated. \n \nPatients randomised to treatment with PDT received PhotoBarr at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight \nthrough slow intravenous injection over 3 to 5 minutes. One or 2 laser light treatments were \nadministered following PhotoBarr injection. The first laser light session occurred 40-50 hours after \ninjection and a second session, if indicated, occurred 96-120 hours after injection. Co-administration \nof omeprazole (20 mg BID) began at least 2 days before PhotoBarr injection. Patients randomised to \nthe OM only group received orally omeprazole 20 mg BID for the duration of the study.   \n \nPatients were followed every 3 months until 4 consecutive, quarterly follow-up endoscopic biopsy \nresults were negative for HGD, and then biannually until the last enrolled patient had completed a \nminimum of 24 months of follow-up evaluations after randomisation.    \n \nPhotoBarr PDT + OM was effective in eliminating HGD in patients with BO. At final analysis, \nperformed at a minimum of 24 months follow-up, a statistically significant percentage of patients \n(77%) in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group demonstrated complete HGD ablation compared to 39% of \npatients in the OM alone group (p<0.0001). Fifty-two percent of patients in the PDT + OM group \nshowed normal squamous cell epithelium while 59% had absence of dysplasia compared to 7% and \n14% in the OM alone group, respectively (p<0.0001). These results confirm those observed after a \nminimum of 6 months follow-up which showed HGD ablation in 72% of patients in the PhotoBarr \nPDT + OM group compared to 31% in the OM only group. Forty-one percent of patients showed \nnormal squamous cell epithelium and 49% had absence of dysplasia. \n \nBy the end of the minimum follow-up of two years, 13% in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group had \nprogressed to cancer compared to 28% in the OM only group in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. \nThe proportion of patients who progressed to cancer in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group was \nstatistically lower than in the OM only group (p=0.0060). The survival curves indicated that, by the \nend of the entire follow-up period, patients in the PhotoBarr PDT + OM group had a 83% chance of \nbeing cancer-free as compared to a 53% chance for patients in the OM only group. Comparison \nbetween the survival curves of the two treatment arms using the log rank test showed a statistically \nsignificant difference between the curves of the two groups in the ITT population (p=0.0014) \nindicating a significant delay in the progression to cancer. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of porfimer sodium have been studied  in 12 patients with endobronchial cancer \nand 23 healthy subjects (11 men and 12 women), given 2 mg/kg porfimer sodium through slow \nintravenous injection. Plasma samples were obtained up to 56 days (patients) or 36 days (volunteers)  \npost injection.   \n \nIn patients,the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 79.6 \u03bcg/ml (C.V. 61%, range 39-222), \nwhereas in volunteers Cmax was 40 \u03bcg/ml and AUCinf was 2400 \u03bcg/h/ml. \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro binding of porfimer sodium to human serum protein is around 90% and independent of \nconcentration between 20 and 100 \u03bcg/ml. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 27\n\n \nElimination \nPorfimer sodium is cleared slowly from the body, with a mean CLT of 0.859 ml/h/kg (C.V. 53%) in \npatients. \n \nThe serum decay was bi-exponential, with a slow distribution phase and a very long elimination phase \nthat started approximately 24 hours after injection. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was 21.5 days \n(CV 26 %, range 264-672) in patients and 17 days in volunteers. \n \nSpecial populations \nThe influence of renal and hepatic impairment on exposure to porfimer sodium has not been evaluated \n(see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nGender had no effect on pharmacokinetic parameters except for tmax, which was approximately \n1.5 hours in women and 0.17 hours in men. At the time of intended photoactivation 40-50 hours after \ninjection, the pharmacokinetic profiles of porfimer sodium in men and women were very similar. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPorfimer sodium was not mutagenic in standard genotoxicity tests in the absence of light. With light \nactivation, porfimer sodium was mutagenic in some in-vitro tests.  \n \nReproductive toxicology studies were insufficient to support the safety of porfimer sodium during \npregnancy, as no light activation had been used. In these studies foetotoxicity, but not teratogenicity, \noccurred in rats and rabbits only at evaluated intravenous doses (greater than of equal to 4 mg/kg) and \nat greater frequency (daily) compared in the clinical use. \n \nPreclinical studies indicate that the excretion of PhotoBarr components occurs primarily via the faecal \nroute \n \n \n6.

Do not mix PhotoBarr with other medicinal products in the same solution.  \nSufficient vials of PhotoBarr should be reconstituted to provide the patient with a dose of 2 mg/kg. For \nmost patients (up to 75 kg) two vials of PhotoBarr 75 mg will suffice. A PhotoBarr 15 mg vial will be \nneeded for every additional 7.5 kg body weight. \n \nSpills and disposal \nSpills of PhotoBarr should be wiped up with a damp cloth.  Skin and eye contact should be avoided \ndue to the potential for photosensitivity reactions upon exposure to light; use of rubber gloves and eye \nprotection is recommended.  \n \nPhotoBarr is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAccidental exposure  \nPhotoBarr is neither a primary ocular irritant nor a primary dermal irritant.  However, because of its \npotential to induce photosensitivity, PhotoBarr might be an eye and/or skin irritant in the presence of \nbright light.  It is important to avoid contact with the eyes and skin during preparation and/or \nadministration.  As with therapeutic overdose, any accidentally overexposed person must be protected \nfrom bright light.\u2019 \n \n \n7.

WHAT PHOTOBARR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nPhotoBarr is a light-activated medicine used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) in combination with a \nnon-burning red laser light. PDT specifically targets and destroys abnormal cells.  \n \nPhotoBarr is used to remove high-grade dysplasia (cells with atypical changes that increase the risk of \ndeveloping cancer) in patients with Barrett's oesophagus (gullet). \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE PHOTOBARR \n \nDo not use PhotoBarr \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to porfimer sodium, other porphyrins or any of the other \n\ningredients of PhotoBarr (listed in section 6, \u2018What PhotoBarr contains\u2019) \n- if you have porphyria \n- if you have an opening (fistula) between the oesophagus and the airways \n- if you suffer from varices of your oesophageal veins or erosion of other major blood vessels \n- if you have ulcers in your oesophagus \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n \nTake special care with PhotoBarr \nTell your doctor if any of the following applies to you: \n- you are taking any other medicines (see below), \n- you have a liver or kidney problems \n- you have a family history of cataracts \n- you are 75 years or older, \n- you have or have had heart or lung disease \n \nPhotoBarr should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, due to lack of \nexperience. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 44\n\nUsing other medicines \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. Some other medicines may increase the risk for \nphotosensitivity reactions for example antibiotics or antidiabetic medicines. \n \nUsing PhotoBarr with food and drink  \nThe laser light application will induce difficulties with swallowing (pain, nausea and vomiting). \nTherefore, you should take liquid food only for a few days (in some cases up to 4 weeks). \nIf eating or drinking becomes impossible or if you keep vomiting, please return to the clinical for \nmedical attention. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPhotoBarr should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.   \nWomen of childbearing age should take adequate contraceptive precautions whilst and up to 90 days \nafter receiving PhotoBarr.  \n \nYou should stop breast-feeding before using PhotoBarr. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nDuring your light treatment you may receive sedation. In this case, you should avoid any activities that \nrequire mental alertness such as driving a car or using any machine.  \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE PHOTOBARR \n \nHow does photodynamic therapy (PDT) work? \nOne course of PDT consists of one injection of PhotoBarr plus one or two laser light applications.  \nTo increase your response rate, you may need up to three PDT courses, separated by at least 90 days. \n \nPhotoBarr injection: You will receive one intravenous injection of PhotoBarr (2 mg per kg of body \nweight), 40 to 50 hours before laser light treatment. The reddish-brown solution is slowly injected, \nover 3 to 5 minutes, into a vein. \n \nLaser light treatment: Your doctor will apply the red laser light (not a burning laser) to the involved \narea using an endoscope (a device used to see inside certain parts of the body). You may receive a \nsecond laser light treatment 96-120 hours after the initial injection of PhotoBarr.  \nYou will be given a sedative along with a local anaesthetic to minimise discomfort. \n \nIf you miss the laser light treatment \nBoth the medicine and laser light are necessary for the therapy to work. If you realise that you have \nmissed your appointment for the laser treatment, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide how to proceed with the treatment. \n \nHow to prevent a photosensitivity reaction \nPhotosensitivity reactions are very common side effects of PhotoBarr (affecting more than 2 users in \n3). They consist mainly of sunburn-like reactions, mild redness on exposed skin, usually the face and \nhands. For 90 days following your PhotoBarr injection, you must take precautions to avoid exposure \nof skin and eyes to light. If you have liver problems, this period might be longer. \n \nSince PhotoBarr is activated by the red part of light, sunscreens for UV (ultraviolet) light will not \nprotect you against photosensitivity reactions. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 45\n\nDirect sunlight:  \nBefore you go to receive your PhotoBarr injection, check that there are adequate shades and curtains in \nyour home to keep out bright sunlight. If you go out during daylight hours (even on cloudy days and \nwhile travelling in a vehicle), you should take the following precautions:  \n- cover as much skin as possible by wearing a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, gloves \n\nand a wide brimmed hat \n- protect your eyes with dark sunglasses. \n- remember to take protective clothing and sunglasses with you to your appointment, as you will \n\nbe photosensitive once the injection has been given. \n \nIndoor light:  \nAvoid direct exposure to bright indoor lights, including dental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded \nlight bulbs at close proximity or neon lights.  \nHowever, to speed up the natural process of inactivating the medicine in your body, it is good to \nexpose the skin to normal levels of indoor light. You do not need to stay in a darkened room.  \n \nPhotosensitivity skin test \nAbout 90 days after the PhotoBarr injection, you should test the photosensitivity of your skin as \nfollows: \nCut a 2-inch hole in a paper bag, put it on your hand or elbow (not your face).  \nExpose a small area of skin to sunlight for 10 minutes.  \nCheck for the appearance of red marks, swelling or blistering after one day.  \n- if none of these appear on the exposed area, then you can gradually return to your normal \n\noutdoor activities, limiting exposure to the sun during the midday hours.  \n- if any of these signs are seen, then continue to protect yourself from bright light for 2 more \n\nweeks, then repeat the skin test.  \nIf you go on holiday to an area with more sunshine, remember to repeat the skin test, especially if \nsome areas of skin have not been exposed to sunlight since your PhotoBarr treatment. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, PhotoBarr can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAll patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive (sensitive to light) and must observe \nprecautions to avoid direct sunlight and bright indoor light (see above \u2018How to prevent a \nphotosensitivity reaction\u2019). \n \nTell your doctor immediately: \n- if you notice a change in your eyesight. You should visit your eye specialist. \n- if you are not able to swallow at all or repeated vomiting occurs \n \nSide effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows: \nVery common: affects more than 1 user in 10 \nCommon: affects 1 to 10 users in 100 \nUncommon: affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000 \nRare: affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000  \nVery rare: affects less than 1 user in 10,000 \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 46\n\nVery common side effects  \n \n- fever \n- photosensitivity reactions (see section 3) \n- vomiting, nausea  \n- tightening of the gullet (oesophagus), difficulty in swallowing that may cause pain \n- constipation, dehydration  \n \n\nCommon side effects  \n \n- back pain, pain in arms and legs, pain due to treatment \n- headache, feeling nervous, tingling feeling, problems sleeping   \n- abdominal stiffness, stomach pain, vomiting blood  \n- disorders of the gullet such as ulcer, irritation or constriction \n- loose stools, passing dark tarry stool, sore throat, hiccups, belching  \n- fluid in chest, chest pain, fast heart beat, shortness of breath, shakes due to high fever, chills  \n- loss of weight, decrease in appetite, feeling tired, loss of taste \n- skin ulcer, rash, itchiness, hives, change in skin colour, scratch, scar, abnormal tissue, bump on \n\nthe skin, very small cysts in the skin, dry and fragile skin  \n \nUncommon side effects  \n \n- difficulty breathing, decrease in level of oxygen, choking, swelling of the airways, fluid in \n\nairways, shortness of breath during physical activity, wheezing, coughing up more phlegm, \ncoughing up blood, stuffy nose \n\n- lung infection, sinus infection \n- chest pain or heart attack, high blood pressure or low blood pressure, chest discomfort \n- abnormal blood test results, including increase in white blood cells, low potassium levels  \n- bleeding, loss of blood, increased tendency to bruise  \n- over development of breasts in men, inability to urinate, temperature intolerance, cold sweats, \n\nnight sweats \n- general swelling, general pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, stiffness of joint, inflammation of the \n\nheel  \n- shakes, restlessness, dizziness, numbness, flushes, feeling weak, feeling unwell \n- loss of hearing, ringing in the ears, swelling of the eye, eye pain  \n- rash, redness at the injection site, nail fungal infection, skin infection, blister, itchy skin,  \n\novergrowth of tissue at the site of skin injury, scar pain, scab, presence of skin moles, abnormal \nhair growth  \n\n \nFrequency not known side effects \n \n- lung infection \n- lower number of red cells in your blood \n- cataract  \n- lesion in intestine, abnormal opening between the wind pipe and the food pipe  \n- allergic reaction  \n- blood clots in your vessels, blockage of blood arteries, inflammation of a vein  \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5.

therapy (pdt) work? one course of pdt consists of one injection of photobarr plus one or two laser light applications. to increase your response rate, you may need up to three pdt courses, separated by at least 90 days. photobarr injection: you will receive one intravenous injection of photobarr (2 mg per kg of body weight), 40 to 50 hours before laser light treatment. the reddish-brown solution is slowly injected, over 3 to 5 minutes, into a vein. laser light treatment: your doctor will apply the red laser light (not a burning laser) to the involved area using an endoscope (a device used to see inside certain parts of the body). you may receive a second laser light treatment 96-120 hours after the initial injection of photobarr. you will be given a sedative along with a local anaesthetic to minimise discomfort. if you miss the laser light treatment both the medicine and laser light are necessary for the therapy to work. if you realise that you have missed your appointment for the laser treatment, contact your doctor immediately. your doctor will decide how to proceed with the treatment. how to prevent a photosensitivity reaction photosensitivity reactions are very common side effects of photobarr (affecting more than 2 users in 3). they consist mainly of sunburn-like reactions, mild redness on exposed skin, usually the face and hands. for 90 days following your photobarr injection, you must take precautions to avoid exposure of skin and eyes to light. if you have liver problems, this period might be longer. since photobarr is activated by the red part of light, sunscreens for uv (ultraviolet) light will not protect you against photosensitivity reactions. direct sunlight: before you go to receive your photobarr injection, check that there are adequate shades and curtains in your home to keep out bright sunlight. if you go out during daylight hours (even on cloudy days and while travelling in a vehicle), you should take the following precautions: - cover as much skin as possible by wearing a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, gloves and a wide brimmed hat - protect your eyes with dark sunglasses. - remember to take protective clothing and sunglasses with you to your appointment, as you will be photosensitive once the injection has been given. indoor light: avoid direct exposure to bright indoor lights, including dental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity or neon lights. however, to speed up the natural process of inactivating the medicine in your body, it is good to expose the skin to normal levels of indoor light. you do not need to stay in a darkened room. photosensitivity skin test about 90 days after the photobarr injection, you should test the photosensitivity of your skin as follows: cut a 2-inch hole in a paper bag, put it on your hand or elbow (not your face). expose a small area of skin to sunlight for 10 minutes. check for the appearance of red marks, swelling or blistering after one day. - if none of these appear on the exposed area, then you can gradually return to your normal outdoor activities, limiting exposure to the sun during the midday hours. - if any of these signs are seen, then continue to protect yourself from bright light for 2 more weeks, then repeat the skin test. if you go on holiday to an area with more sunshine, remember to repeat the skin test, especially if some areas of skin have not been exposed to sunlight since your photobarr treatment.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "photobarr", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset":
