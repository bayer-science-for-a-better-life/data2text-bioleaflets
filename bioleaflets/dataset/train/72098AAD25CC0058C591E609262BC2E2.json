PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection.\nClear liquid with white precipitate.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nGardasil 9 is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 9 years against the \nfollowing HPV diseases:\n\uf0b7 Premalignant lesions and cancers affecting the cervix, vulva, vagina and anus caused by vaccine \n\nHPV types.\n\uf0b7 Genital warts (Condyloma acuminata) caused by specific HPV types.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support these indications.\n\nThe use of Gardasil 9 should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose (0, 6 \u2013 12 months) schedule (see section 5.1).\nThe second dose should be administered between 5 and 13 months after the first dose. If the second \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nvaccine dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should always be \nadministered. \n\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) schedule. The second dose \nshould be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should be \nadministered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year \nperiod.\n\nIndividuals 15 years of age and older at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) schedule.\n\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period.\n\nThe use of Gardasil 9 should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil 9 (see section 4.4).\n\nThe need for a booster dose has not been established.\n\nStudies using a mixed regimen (interchangeability) of HPV vaccines were not performed for \nGardasil 9.\n\nSubjects previously vaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 \nvaccine (Gardasil), hereafter referred to as qHPV vaccine, may receive 3 doses of Gardasil 9 (see \nsection 5.1). qHPV vaccine was also known as Silgard in some countries.\n\nPaediatric population (children <9 years of age)\nThe safety and efficacy of Gardasil 9 in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the deltoid area of \nthe upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.\n\nGardasil 9 must not be injected intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should \nnot be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solution. \n\nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nIndividuals with hypersensitivity after previous administration of Gardasil 9 or Gardasil/Silgard \nshould not receive Gardasil 9.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nThe decision to vaccinate an individual should take into account the risk for previous HPV exposure \nand potential benefit from vaccination.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nSyncope (fainting), sometimes associated with falling, can occur following, or even before, any \nvaccination, especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be \naccompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia, and\ntonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Therefore, vaccinees should be observed for \napproximately 15 minutes after vaccination. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury \nfrom fainting.\n\nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. \nHowever, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or low-\ngrade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.\n\nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil 9 may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.\n\nThe vaccine will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types targeted by the vaccine \n(see section 5.1). Therefore, appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should\ncontinue to be used.\n\nThe vaccine is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established \nclinical disease. The vaccine has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect. The vaccine is therefore \nnot indicated for treatment of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar, \nvaginal and anal dysplastic lesions or genital warts. It is also not intended to prevent progression of \nother established HPV-related lesions.\n\nGardasil 9 does not prevent lesions due to a vaccine HPV type in individuals infected with that HPV \ntype at the time of vaccination.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100% effective and \nGardasil 9 will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against HPV infections present at \nthe time of vaccination, routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local \nrecommendations.\n\nThere are no data on the use of Gardasil 9 in individuals with impaired immune responsiveness. Safety \nand immunogenicity of a qHPV vaccine have been assessed in individuals aged 7 to 12 years who are \nknown to be infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (see section 5.1).\n\nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, due to either the use of potent immunosuppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may not \nrespond to the vaccine.\n\nThis vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.\n\nLong-term follow-up studies are currently ongoing to determine the duration of protection (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Gardasil 9 with \nbivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSafety and immunogenicity in individuals who have received immunoglobulin or blood-derived \nproducts during the 3 months prior to vaccination have not been studied in clinical trials.\n\nUse with other vaccines\n\nGardasil 9 may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing \ndiphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis \n[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) with no significant interference with antibody \nresponse to any of the components of either vaccine. This is based on the results from a clinical trial in \nwhich a combined dTap-IPV vaccine was administered concomitantly with the first dose of Gardasil 9\n(see section 4.8).\n\nUse with hormonal contraceptives\n\nIn clinical studies, 60.2% of women aged 16 to 26 years who received Gardasil 9 used hormonal \ncontraceptives during the vaccination period of the clinical studies. Use of hormonal contraceptives \ndid not appear to affect the type-specific immune responses to Gardasil 9.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicates no \nmalformative nor foeto/neonatal toxicity of Gardasil 9 (see section 5.1).\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nHowever, these data are considered insufficient to recommend use of Gardasil 9 during pregnancy. \nVaccination should be postponed until completion of pregnancy (see section 5.1).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nGardasil 9 can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nA total of 92 women were breast-feeding during the vaccination period of the clinical studies of \nGardasil 9 in women aged 16 to 26 years. In the studies, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable \nbetween breast-feeding women and women who did not breast-feed. In addition, the adverse \nexperience profile for breast-feeding women was comparable to that of the women in the overall \nsafety population. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse experiences reported in infants who \nwere breast-feeding during the vaccination period.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of Gardasil 9 on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nGardasil 9 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, some of the \neffects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may temporarily affect the ability to drive \nor use machines.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nA. Summary of the safety profile\n\nIn 7 clinical trials, individuals were administered Gardasil 9 on the day of enrolment and \napproximately 2 and 6 months thereafter. Safety was evaluated using vaccination report card \n(VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil 9. A total of 15,776 individuals \n(10,495 subjects aged 16 to 26 years and 5,281 adolescents aged 9 to 15 years at enrolment) received \nGardasil 9. Few individuals (0.1%) discontinued due to adverse experiences. \n\nIn a clinical trial that included 640 individuals aged 27 to 45 years and 570 individuals aged 16 to \n26 years who received Gardasil 9, the safety profile of Gardasil 9 was comparable between the two \nage groups.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions observed with Gardasil 9 were injection-site adverse reactions \n(84.8% of vaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit) and headache (13.2% of the \nvaccinees within 15 days following any vaccination visit). These adverse reactions usually were mild \nor moderate in intensity.\n\nB. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nClinical trials\n\nAdverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination have been categorised by \nfrequency.\n\nFrequencies are reported as:\n- Very common (\u22651/10)\n- Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)\n- Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions following administration of Gardasil 9 occurring with a frequency of at \nleast 1.0% from clinical trials*\n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery common Headache\nCommon Dizziness\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery common At the injection site: pain, swelling, erythema\n\nCommon Pyrexia, fatigue, \nAt the injection site: pruritus, bruising\n\n*Adverse reactions included in this table are from 7 clinical trials (PN 001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007 and 009, N=15,776 individuals) (see \nsection 5.1 for description of the clinical trials).\n\nIn a clinical trial of 1,053 healthy adolescents aged 11 to 15 years, administration of the first dose of \nGardasil 9 concomitantly with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] and \npoliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine showed that more injection-site reactions (swelling, \nerythema), headache and pyrexia were reported. The differences observed were < 10% and in the \nmajority of subjects, the adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in intensity (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nPost-marketing experience\n\nThe following adverse experiences have been spontaneously reported during post-approval use of \nqHPV vaccine and may also be seen in post-marketing experience with Gardasil 9. The \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\npost-marketing safety experience with qHPV vaccine is relevant to Gardasil 9 since the vaccines \ncontain L1 HPV proteins of 4 of the same HPV types.\n\nBecause these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to \nreliably estimate their frequency or to establish, for all events, a causal relationship to vaccine \nexposure.\n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported from Post-marketing experience with qHPV vaccine\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions\n\nInfections and infestations Not known Injection-site cellulitis\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura, \nlymphadenopathy\n\nImmune system disorders Not known Hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, \nbronchospasm and urticaria\n\nNervous system disorders Not known Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, syncope sometimes \naccompanied by tonic-clonic movements\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Not known Vomiting\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nNot known Arthralgia, myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nNot known Asthenia, chills, malaise\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo cases of overdose have been reported.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Papillomavirus vaccines, ATC code: J07BM03\n\nMechanism of action\n\nGardasil 9 is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant 9-valent vaccine. It is prepared from the \nhighly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein from the same four HPV \ntypes (6, 11, 16, 18) in qHPV vaccine and from 5 additional HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52, 58). It uses the \nsame amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant as qHPV vaccine. The VLPs cannot \ninfect cells, reproduce or cause disease. The efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines is thought to be mediated by \nthe development of a humoral immune response. The genotypes for the vaccine comprised of HPV \ntypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 will be referred to as vaccine HPV types.\n\nBased on epidemiology studies, Gardasil 9 is anticipated to protect against the HPV types that cause\napproximately: 90% of cervical cancers, more than 95% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), 75-85% of \nhigh-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), 85-90% of HPV related vulvar cancers,\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\n90-95% of HPV related high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3), 80-85% of HPV related \nvaginal cancers, 75-85% of HPV related high-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3), \n90-95% of HPV related anal cancer, 85-90% of HPV related high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia \n(AIN 2/3), and 90% of genital warts.\n\nThe indication of Gardasil 9 is based on:\n\uf0b7 demonstration of efficacy of qHPV vaccine to prevent persistent infection and disease related to \n\nHPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in females aged 16 to 45 years and males aged 16 to 26 years.\n\uf0b7 demonstration of non-inferior immunogenicity between Gardasil 9 and the qHPV vaccine for \n\nHPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in girls aged 9 to 15 years, women and men aged 16 to 26 years; \nefficacy for Gardasil 9 against persistent infection and disease related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or \n18 can be inferred to be comparable to that of the qHPV vaccine.\n\n\uf0b7 demonstration of efficacy against persistent infection and disease related to HPV types 31, 33,\n45, 52 and 58 in girls and women aged 16 to 26 years, and \n\n\uf0b7 demonstration of non-inferior immunogenicity against the Gardasil 9 HPV types in boys and \ngirls aged 9 to 15 years, men aged 16 to 26 years and women aged 27 to 45 years, compared to \ngirls and women aged 16 to 26 years.\n\nClinical studies for Gardasil 9\n\nEfficacy and/or immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 were assessed in ten clinical studies. Clinical studies \nevaluating the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against placebo were not acceptable because HPV vaccination is \nrecommended and implemented in many countries for protection against HPV infection and disease.\n\nTherefore, the pivotal clinical study (Protocol 001) evaluated the efficacy of Gardasil 9 using qHPV \nvaccine as a comparator.\n\nEfficacy against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was primarily assessed using a bridging strategy that \ndemonstrated comparable immunogenicity (as measured by Geometric Mean Titres [GMT]) of \nGardasil 9 compared with qHPV vaccine (Protocol 001, GDS01C/Protocol 009 and GDS07C/Protocol \n020).\n\nIn the pivotal study Protocol 001, the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 \nwas evaluated compared to qHPV vaccine in women aged 16 to 26 years (N=14,204: 7,099 receiving \nGardasil 9; 7,105 receiving qHPV vaccine).\n\nProtocol 002 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to 15 years and women \naged 16 to 26 years (N=3,066: 1,932 girls; 666 boys; and 468 women receiving Gardasil 9). \n\nProtocol 003 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in men aged 16 to 26 years and women aged 16 \nto 26 years (N=2,515:1,103 Heterosexual Men [HM]; 313 Men Who Have Sex with Men [MSM]; and \n1,099 women receiving Gardasil 9).\n\nProtocol 004 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in women aged 16 to 45 years (N=1,210: 640 \nwomen aged 27 to 45 years and 570 women aged 16 to 26 years). \n\nProtocols 005 and 007 evaluated Gardasil 9 concomitantly administered with vaccines recommended \nroutinely in girls and boys aged 11 to 15 years (N=2,295). \n\nProtocol 006 evaluated administration of Gardasil 9 to girls and women aged 12 to 26 years previously \nvaccinated with qHPV vaccine (N=921; 615 receiving Gardasil 9 and 306 receiving placebo). \n\nGDS01C/Protocol 009 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in girls aged 9 to 15 years (N=600; \n300 receiving Gardasil 9 and 300 receiving qHPV vaccine). \n\nGDS07C/Protocol 020 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in men aged 16 to 26 years (N=500; \n249 receiving Gardasil 9 and 251 receiving qHPV vaccine).\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nProtocol 010 evaluated the immunogenicity of 2 doses of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to \n14 years and 3 doses of Gardasil 9 in girls aged 9 to 14 years and women aged 16 to 26 years \n(N=1,518; 753 girls; 451 boys and 314 women).\n\nStudies supporting the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18\n\nEfficacy of qHPV vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18\n\nThe efficacy and long-term effectiveness of qHPV vaccine against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related \ndisease endpoints have been demonstrated in clinical studies in the PPE (Per Protocol Efficacy)\npopulation. The PPE population consisted of individuals who received all 3 vaccinations with qHPV \nvaccine in the base study within 1 year of enrolment without major deviations from the study protocol, \nwere seronegative to the relevant HPV type(s) (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior to dose 1, and among \nsubjects 16 years and older at enrolment in the base study, PCR negative to the relevant HPV type(s) \nprior to dose 1 through one month postdose 3 (Month 7).\n\nIn 16- through 26- year-old women (N=20,541) efficacy against HPV 16- and 18-related CIN2/3, AIS \nor cervical cancer was 98.2% (95% CI: 93.5, 99.8) based on follow-up to 4 years (median 3.6 years); \nefficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18-related diseases was 96.0% (95% CI: 92.3, 98.2) for CIN or AIS, \n100% (95% CI: 67.2, 100) for VIN2/3, 100% (95% CI: 55.4, 100) for VaIN2/3, and 99.0% (95% CI: \n96.2, 99.9) for genital warts.\n\nIn 24- through 45- year-old women (N=3,817) efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18-related persistent \ninfection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers was \n88.7% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.8).\n\nIn 16- through 26- year-old men (N=4,055) efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18-related diseases was \n74.9% (95% CI: 8.8, 95.4) for AIN 2/3 (median duration of follow-up of 2.15 years), 100.0% (95% \nCI: -52.1, 100) for penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) 1/2/3, and 89.3% (95% CI: \n65.3, 97.9) for genital warts (median duration of follow-up of 4 years). \n\nIn the long-term extension registry study for 16-23 year old women (n = 2,121), no cases of high grade \nCIN were observed up to approximately 14 years. In this study, a durable protection was statistically \ndemonstrated to approximately 12 years.\n\nIn long-term extensions of clinical studies, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and no \ncases of genital warts were observed:\n\n- through 10.7 years in girls (n=369) and 10.6 years in boys (n = 326), 9-15 years of age at \ntime of vaccination (median follow-up of 10.0 years and 9.9 years, respectively); \n\n- through 11.5 years in men (n=917), 16-26 years of age at time of vaccination (median \nfollow-up of 9.5 years); and through 10.1 years in women (n = 685), 24-45 years of age at \ntime of vaccination (median follow-up of 8.7 years).\n\nImmunogenicity bridging from qHPV Vaccine to Gardasil 9 for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18\n\nComparison of Gardasil 9 with qHPV vaccine with respect to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were \nconducted in a population of women aged 16 to 26 years from Protocol 001, girls aged 9 to 15 years \nfrom GDS01C/Protocol 009 and men aged 16 to 26 years from GDS07C/Protocol 020.\n\nA statistical analysis of non-inferiority was performed at Month 7 comparing cLIA anti-HPV 6, \nanti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs between individuals administered Gardasil 9 and \nindividuals administered Gardasil.

The efficacy of Gardasil 9 \nagainst CIN 3 related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV vaccine was 100% (95% CI 46.3,\n100.0) with 0/5,952 versus 8/5,947 cases.\n\nImpact of Gardasil 9 against cervical biopsy and definite therapy related to vaccine HPV types \nin the PPE\nThe efficacy of Gardasil 9 against cervical biopsy related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV \nvaccine was 95.9% (95% CI 92.7, 97.9) with 11/6,016 versus 262/6,018 cases. The efficacy of \nGardasil 9 against cervical definitive therapy (including loop electrosurgical excision procedure \n[LEEP] or conisation) related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV vaccine was 90.7% (95% CI \n76.3, 97.0) with 4/6,016 versus 43/6,018 cases.\n\nLong-term effectiveness studies\n\nA subset of subjects is being followed up for 10 to 14 years after Gardasil 9 vaccination for safety, \nimmunogenicity, and effectiveness against clinical diseases related to the HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nIn the long-term extensions of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, effectiveness was observed in \nthe PPE population. The PPE population consisted of individuals:\n\n- who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, without major deviations from the \nstudy protocol,\n\n- who were seronegative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and among women \naged 16 to 26 years, PCR negative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 through \none month postdose 3 (Month 7).\n\nIn Protocol 001registry study, no cases of vaccine HPV types related high-grade CIN were observed \nthrough 9.5 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 6.3 years) in women (n = 1,448) who were aged 16 \nto 26 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9.\n\nIn Protocol 002 extension study, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or genital warts were \nobserved through 8.2 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 7.6 years) in girls (n = 864) and through \n8.1 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 7.6 years) in boys (n = 261) who were aged 9 to 15 years at \ntime of vaccination with Gardasil 9.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nThe minimum anti-HPV titre that confers protective efficacy has not been determined.\n\nType-specific immunoassays with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each \nvaccine HPV type. These assays measured antibodies against neutralising epitopes for each HPV type. \nThe scales for these assays are unique to each HPV type; thus, comparisons across types and to other \nassays are not appropriate.\n\nImmune response to Gardasil 9 at Month 7\n\nImmunogenicity was measured by (1) the percentage of individuals who were seropositive for \nantibodies against the relevant vaccine HPV type, and (2) the Geometric Mean Titre (GMT).\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nGardasil 9 induced robust anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, anti-HPV 18, anti-HPV 31, \nanti-HPV 33, anti-HPV 45, anti-HPV 52, and anti-HPV 58 responses measured at Month 7, in \nProtocols 001, 002, 004, 005, 007, and GDS01C/Protocol 009. In clinical studies 99.2% to 100% who \nreceived Gardasil 9 became seropositive for antibodies against all 9 vaccine types by Month 7 across \nall groups tested. GMTs were higher in girls and boys than in women aged 16 to 26 years, and higher \nin boys than in girls and women. As expected for women 27 to 45 years of age (Protocol 004), the \nobserved GMTs were lower than those seen in women aged 16 to 26 years.\n\nAnti-HPV responses at Month 7 among girls/boys aged 9 to 15 years were comparable to anti-HPV \nresponses in women aged 16 to 26 years in the combined database of immunogenicity studies for \nGardasil 9.\n\nOn the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to\n15 years is inferred.\n\nIn Protocol 003, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at Month 7 among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years\nwere comparable to anti-HPV antibody GMTs among girls and women aged 16 to 26 years for vaccine \nHPV types. High immunogenicity in MSM aged 16 to 26 years was also observed, although lower \nthan in HM, similarly to qHPV vaccine. In Protocol 020/GDS07C, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at \nMonth 7 among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years were comparable to anti-HPV antibody \nGMTs among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years administered with the qHPV vaccine for HPV \n6, 11, 16 and 18. These results support the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in the male population.\n\nIn Protocol 004, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at Month 7 among women aged 27 to 45 years were \nnon-inferior to anti-HPV antibody GMTs among girls and women aged 16 to 26 years for HPV 16, 18, \n31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 with GMT ratios between 0.66 and 0.73. In a post hoc analysis for HPV 6 and \n11, the GMT ratios were 0.76 and 0.81 respectively. These results support the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in \nwomen aged 27 to 45 years.\n\nPersistence of immune response to Gardasil 9\n\nIn long-term follow-up extension of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, persistence of antibody \nresponses was observed:\n\uf0b7 for at least 5 years in women who were aged 16 to 26 years at time of vaccination with \n\nGardasil 9, depending on HPV type, 78 to100 % of subjects were seropositive; however, \nefficacy was maintained in all subjects regardless of seropositivity status for any vaccine HPV \ntype through the end of the study (up to 67 months postdose 3, median follow-up duration of \n43 months postdose 3),\n\n\uf0b7 for at least 7 years in girls and boys who were aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with \nGardasil 9; depending on HPV type, 91 to 99 % of subjects were seropositive.\n\nEvidence of anamnestic (Immune Memory) response\n\nEvidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated women who were seropositive to relevant\nHPV type(s) prior to vaccination. In addition, women (n = 150) who received 3 doses of Gardasil 9 in \nProtocol 001 and a challenge dose 5 years later, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response that \nexceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month postdose 3.\n\nAdministration of Gardasil 9 to individuals previously vaccinated with qHPV vaccine\n\nProtocol 006 evaluated the immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in 921 girls and women (aged 12 to \n26 years) who had previously been vaccinated with qHPV vaccine. For subjects receiving Gardasil 9 \nafter receiving 3 doses of qHPV vaccine, there was an interval of at least 12 months between \ncompletion of vaccination with qHPV vaccine and the start of vaccination with Gardasil 9 with a \n3-dose regimen (the time interval ranged from approximately 12 to 36 months).\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nSeropositivity to vaccine HPV types in the per protocol population ranged from 98.3 to 100% by \nMonth 7 in individuals who received Gardasil 9. The GMTs to HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18 were higher\nthan in the population who had not previously received qHPV vaccine in other studies whereas the \nGMTs to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were lower. The clinical significance of this observation is \nnot known.\n\nImmunogenicity in HIV infected subjects\n\nNo clinical study of Gardasil 9 was conducted in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nA study documenting safety and immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine has been performed in 126 HIV \ninfected subjects aged 7 to12 years with baseline CD4% \u226515 and at least 3 months of highly active \nantiretroviral therapy (HAART) for subjects with a CD4% <25 (of which 96 received qHPV vaccine). \nSeroconversion to all four antigens occurred in more than 96% of the subjects. The GMTs were \nsomewhat lower than reported in non-HIV infected subjects of the same age in other studies. The \nclinical relevance of the lower response is unknown. The safety profile was similar to non-HIV \ninfected subjects in other studies. The CD4% or plasma HIV RNA was not affected by vaccination.\n\nImmune responses to Gardasil 9 using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9 through 14 years of age\n\nProtocol 010 measured HPV antibody responses to the 9 HPV types after Gardasil 9 vaccination in the \nfollowing cohorts: girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years receiving 2 doses at a 6-month or 12-month \ninterval (+/- 1-month); girls aged 9 to 14 years receiving 3 doses (at 0, 2, 6 months); and women aged \n16 to 26 years receiving 3 doses (at 0, 2, 6 months).\n\nOne month following the last dose of the assigned regimen, between 97.9% and 100% of subjects \nacross all groups became seropositive for antibodies against the 9 vaccine HPV types. GMTs were \nhigher in girls and boys who received 2 doses of Gardasil 9 (at either 0, 6 months or 0, 12 months) \nthan in girls and women 16 to 26 years of age who received 3 doses of Gardasil 9 (at 0, 2, 6 months) \nfor each of the 9 vaccine HPV types. On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of a \n2-dose regimen of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years is inferred. \n\nIn the same study, in girls and boys aged 9 to14 years, GMTs at one month after the last vaccine dose \nwere numerically lower for some vaccine types after a 2-dose schedule than after a 3-dose schedule \n(i.e., HPV types 18, 31, 45, and 52 after 0, 6 months and HPV type 45 after 0, 12 months). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n\nIn girls and boys receiving 2 doses at 6- or 12-month interval (+/- 1-month), persistence of antibody \nresponse was demonstrated through Month 36; depending on HPV type, 81% to 99% of girls and boys \nreceiving 2 doses at 6-month interval and 88% to 100% of girls and boys receiving 2 doses at \n12-month interval were seropositive. At Month 36, the GMTs in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years \nreceiving 2 doses at a 6-month interval (+/- 1-month) remained non-inferior to GMTs in women aged\n16 to 26 years receiving 3 doses of Gardasil 9.\n\nIn a clinical trial, persistence of antibody response has been demonstrated for at least 5 years in girls\naged 9 to13 years who received 2 doses of qHPV vaccine.\n\nDuration of protection of a 2-dose schedule of Gardasil 9 has not been established.\n\nPregnancy\n\nSpecific studies of Gardasil 9 in pregnant women were not conducted. The qHPV vaccine was used as \nan active control during the clinical development program for Gardasil 9.\n\nDuring the clinical development of Gardasil 9; 2,586 women (1,347 in the Gardasil 9 group vs. 1,239 \nin the qHPV vaccine group) reported at least one pregnancy. The types of anomalies or proportion of \npregnancies with an adverse outcome in individuals who received Gardasil 9 or qHPV vaccine were \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\ncomparable and consistent with the general population.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nA repeat dose toxicity study in rats, which included an evaluation of single-dose toxicity and local \ntolerance, revealed no special hazards to humans.\n\nGardasil 9 administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or \nembryonic/foetal development.\n\nGardasil 9 administered to female rats had no effects on development, behaviour, reproductive\nperformance or fertility of the offspring. Antibodies against all 9 HPV types were transferred to the \noffspring during gestation and lactation.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- If you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Gardasil 9 is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Gardasil 9\n3. How Gardasil 9 is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Gardasil 9\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Gardasil 9 is and what it is used for\n\nGardasil 9 is a vaccine for children and adolescents from 9 years of age and adults. It is given to \nprotect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 \nand 58.\n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and \nvagina), pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the anus and genital warts in males and females.\n\nGardasil 9 has been studied in males 9 to 26 years of age and females 9 to 45 years of age.\n\nGardasil 9 protects against the HPV types that cause most cases of these diseases.\n\nGardasil 9 is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nGardasil 9 does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil 9 can still protect against diseases associated \nwith the other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 cannot cause HPV-related diseases.\n\nWhen an individual is vaccinated with Gardasil 9, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence \nsystem) stimulates production of antibodies against the nine vaccine HPV types, to help protect \nagainst the diseases caused by these viruses.\n\nIf you or your child receive a first dose of Gardasil 9, you have to complete the full vaccination course \nwith Gardasil 9.\n\nIf you or your child already received an HPV vaccine, ask your doctor if Gardasil 9 is right for you.\n\nGardasil 9 should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Gardasil 9\n\nDo not receive Gardasil 9 if you or your child\n\n\uf0b7 is allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed \nunder \u201cother ingredients\u201d, in section 6).\n\n\uf0b7 developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil or Silgard (HPV types 6, 11, \n16, and 18) or Gardasil 9.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you or your child:\n\uf0b7 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia;\n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system;\n\uf0b7 suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for \n\nexample having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. If you are a woman, you should \ncontinue to follow your doctor\u2019s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and \nprotective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil 9\n\nThe duration of protection is not yet known. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine \nwhether a booster dose is needed.\n\nOther medicines and Gardasil 9\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nGardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) \nwith either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, \ndT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the \nother arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nGardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nHormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil 9.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before you receive this vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nGardasil 9 may slightly and temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4 \n\u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\nGardasil 9 contains sodium chloride\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How Gardasil 9 is given\n\nGardasil 9 is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil 9 is intended for adolescents and adults \nfrom 9 years of age onwards.\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose) \n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)\nAll three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more \ninformation.\n\nIf you are from 15 years of age at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose)\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)\nAll three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more \ninformation.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil 9.\n\nGardasil 9 will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the \nupper arm or thigh).\n\nIf you forget one dose of Gardasil 9\n\nIf a scheduled injection is missed, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\nIt is important that you follow your doctor or nurse\u2019s instructions regarding return visits for the follow-\nup doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor \nfor advice. When Gardasil 9 is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Gardasil 9, and not another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Gardasil 9:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): side effects found at the injection site (pain, \nswelling, and redness) and headache.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): side effects found at the injection site (bruising, and \nitching), fever, tiredness, dizziness and nausea.\n\nWhen Gardasil 9 was given with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] \nand poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine during the same visit, there was more injection-site \nswelling.\n\nThe following side effects have been reported with GARDASIL or SILGARD and may also be \nseen after getting GARDASIL 9:\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported. Although fainting \nepisodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive HPV vaccine.\n\nAllergic reactions have been reported. Some of these reactions have been severe. Symptoms may \ninclude difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives and/or rash.\n\nAs with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands \n(neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper \nbody, or confusion (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); vomiting, joint \npain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, bleeding or \nbruising more easily than normal and skin infection at the injection site.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national\nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more \ninformation on the safety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Gardasil 9\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial label after EXP.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Gardasil 9 is and what it is used for\n\nGardasil 9 is a vaccine for children and adolescents from 9 years of age and adults. It is given to \nprotect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 \nand 58.\n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and \nvagina), pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the anus and genital warts in males and females.\n\nGardasil 9 has been studied in males 9 to 26 years of age and females 9 to 45 years of age.\n\nGardasil 9 protects against the HPV types that cause most cases of these diseases.\n\nGardasil 9 is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nGardasil 9 does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil 9 can still protect against diseases associated \nwith the other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 cannot cause HPV-related diseases.\n\nWhen an individual is vaccinated with Gardasil 9, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence \nsystem) stimulates production of antibodies against the nine vaccine HPV types, to help protect \nagainst the diseases caused by these viruses.\n\nIf you or your child receive a first dose of Gardasil 9, you have to complete the full vaccination course \nwith Gardasil 9.\n\nIf you or your child already received an HPV vaccine, ask your doctor if Gardasil 9 is right for you.\n\nGardasil 9 should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Gardasil 9\n\nDo not receive Gardasil 9 if you or your child\n\n\uf0b7 is allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed \nunder \u201cother ingredients\u201d, in section 6).\n\n\uf0b7 developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil or Silgard (HPV types 6, 11, \n16, and 18) or Gardasil 9.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you or your child:\n\uf0b7 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia;\n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system;\n\uf0b7 suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for \n\nexample having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. If you are a woman, you should \ncontinue to follow your doctor\u2019s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and \nprotective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil 9\n\nThe duration of protection is not yet known. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine \nwhether a booster dose is needed.\n\nOther medicines and Gardasil 9\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nGardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) \nwith either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, \ndT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the \nother arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nGardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nHormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil 9.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before you receive this vaccine.\n\nGardasil 9 may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nGardasil 9 may slightly and temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4 \n\u201cPossible side effects\u201d).\n\nGardasil 9 contains sodium chloride\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d.\n\n3. How Gardasil 9 is given\n\nGardasil 9 is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil 9 is intended for adolescents and adults \nfrom 9 years of age onwards.\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nGardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose) \n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)\nAll three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more \ninformation.\n\nIf you are from 15 years of age at time of first injection\nGardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n- First injection: at chosen date\n- Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose)\n- Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)\nAll three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more \ninformation.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination \ncourse with Gardasil 9.\n\nGardasil 9 will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the \nupper arm or thigh).\n\nIf you forget one dose of Gardasil 9\n\nIf a scheduled injection is missed, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.\nIt is important that you follow your doctor or nurse\u2019s instructions regarding return visits for the follow-\nup doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor \nfor advice. When Gardasil 9 is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Gardasil 9, and not another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Gardasil 9:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): side effects found at the injection site (pain, \nswelling, and redness) and headache.\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): side effects found at the injection site (bruising, and \nitching), fever, tiredness, dizziness and nausea.\n\nWhen Gardasil 9 was given with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] \nand poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine during the same visit, there was more injection-site \nswelling.\n\nThe following side effects have been reported with GARDASIL or SILGARD and may also be \nseen after getting GARDASIL 9:\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported. Although fainting \nepisodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive HPV vaccine.\n\nAllergic reactions have been reported. Some of these reactions have been severe. Symptoms may \ninclude difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives and/or rash.\n\nAs with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands \n(neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper \nbody, or confusion (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); vomiting, joint \npain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, bleeding or \nbruising more easily than normal and skin infection at the injection site.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national \nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more \ninformation on the safety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Gardasil 9\n\nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and syringe label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00baC - 8\u00baC). Do not freeze. Keep the syringe in the outer carton in order to \nprotect from light.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what gardasil 9 is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "gardasil 9 is a vaccine for children and adolescents from 9 years of age and adults. it is given to protect against diseases caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. these diseases include pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and vagina), pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the anus and genital warts in males and females. gardasil 9 has been studied in males 9 to 26 years of age and females 9 to 45 years of age. gardasil 9 protects against the hpv types that cause most cases of these diseases. gardasil 9 is intended to prevent these diseases. the vaccine is not used to treat hpv related diseases. gardasil 9 does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease associated with any of the hpv types in the vaccine. however, in individuals who are already infected with one or more of the vaccine hpv types, gardasil 9 can still protect against diseases associated with the other hpv types in the vaccine. gardasil 9 cannot cause hpv-related diseases. when an individual is vaccinated with gardasil 9, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) stimulates production of antibodies against the nine vaccine hpv types, to help protect against the diseases caused by these viruses. if you or your child receive a first dose of gardasil 9, you have to complete the full vaccination course with gardasil 9. if you or your child already received an hpv vaccine, ask your doctor if gardasil 9 is right for you. gardasil 9 should be used in accordance with official guidelines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "gardasil 9", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

allergic reaction after receiving a dose of gardasil or silgard (hpv types 6, 11, 16, and 18) or gardasil 9. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or nurse if you or your child: has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example haemophilia; has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, hiv infection or medicines that affect the immune system; suffer from an illness with high fever. however, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle injection. therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection. as with any vaccine, gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine. gardasil 9 will not protect against every type of human papillomavirus. therefore appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used. vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. if you are a woman, you should continue to follow your doctor's advice on cervical smear/pap tests and preventative and protective measures. what other important information should you or your child know about gardasil 9 the duration of protection is not yet known. longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine whether a booster dose is needed. other medicines and gardasil 9 tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. gardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (t) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (ipv) (dtap, dt-ipv, dtap-ipv vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the other arm or leg) during the same visit. gardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system. hormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained

swelling, and redness) and headache. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): side effects found at the injection site (bruising, and itching), fever, tiredness, dizziness and nausea. when gardasil 9 was given with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component] and poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine during the same visit, there was more injection-site swelling. the following side effects have been reported with gardasil or silgard and may also be seen after getting gardasil 9: fainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported. although fainting episodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive hpv vaccine. allergic reactions have been reported. some of these reactions have been severe. symptoms may include difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives and/or rash. as with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands (neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper body, or confusion (guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis); vomiting, joint pain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal and skin infection at the injection site. reporting of side effects if you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting
