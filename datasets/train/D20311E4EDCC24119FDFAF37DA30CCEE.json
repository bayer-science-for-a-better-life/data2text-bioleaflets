PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2775 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \n\ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not \nrecommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage \nadjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary inolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended for use in children and adolescents \nbecause the safety and efficacy have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25aa Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n\u25aa Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u25aa Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n\u25aa Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n\u25aa Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\u25aa The concomitant use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products \n\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \u226530 ml/min but <60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). \nDual blockade of RAAS  through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nblockers or aliskirenis therefore not recommended ( see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy \nis considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, minimal or no \neffects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-\ncontaining salts substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is administered with \nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \nantiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after these medications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \n\nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n\n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried \nout in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n\n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended and alternative \ntreatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while \nnursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast feeding is not recommended. If Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used during \nbreast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is unlikely to affect \nthe ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken \ninto account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated \n\ncases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by \ncuff during office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva as initial therapy for severe \nhypertension (defined as SeDBP \u2265 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-\nblind, active-controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 \nratio to either irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and \nsystematically force-titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were \u2265 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were \u2265 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (\u226550,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, the absolute \noral bioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food \ndoes not affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Peak plasma \nconcentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for \nhydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in oldersubjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary inolder people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n\u2022 kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n\u2022 slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n\u2022 stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n\u2022 decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n\n\u2022  Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \nwhose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or \nirbesartan 150 mg alone; \n\n\u2022  Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n\u2022  Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not \nrecommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage \nadjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary inolder people. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended for use in children and adolescents \nbecause the safety and efficacy have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25aa Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n\u25aa Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u25aa Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n\u25aa Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n\u25aa Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\u25aa The concomitant use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products \n\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) (see sections4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is \u2265 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 30 ml/min but <60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, minimal or no \neffects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-\ncontaining salts substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is administered with \nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \nantiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after these medications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \n\nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n\n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried \nout in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended and alternative \ntreatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while \nnursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast feeding is not recommended. If Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used during \nbreast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is unlikely to affect \nthe ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken \ninto account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated \n\ncases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \n\nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, \nphotosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \n\nand unspecified (incl cysts and \n\npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by \ncuff during office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva as initial therapy for severe \nhypertension (defined as SeDBP \u2265 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-\nblind, active-controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 \nratio to either irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and \nsystematically force-titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were \u2265 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were \u2265 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group that in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (\u226550,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, the absolute \noral bioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food \ndoes not affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Peak plasma \nconcentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for \nhydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary inolder people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n\u2022 kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n\u2022 slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n\u2022 stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n\u2022 decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\n \nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \n\ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not \nrecommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage \nadjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended for use in children and adolescents \nbecause the safety and efficacy have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25aa Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n\u25aa Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u25aa Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n\u25aa Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n\u25aa Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\u25aa The concomitant use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products \n\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nclearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is \u2265 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 30 ml/min but <60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, minimal or no \neffects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-\ncontaining salts substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is administered with \nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \nantiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after these medications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \n\nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried \nout in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended and alternative \ntreatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while \nnursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast feeding is not recommended. If Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used during \nbreast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is unlikely to affect \nthe ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken \ninto account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \n\nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \n\nand unspecified (incl cysts and \n\npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by \ncuff during office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva as initial therapy for severe \nhypertension (defined as SeDBP \u2265 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-\nblind, active-controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 \nratio to either irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and \nsystematically force-titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were \u2265 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were \u2265 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group that in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (\u226550,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, the absolute \noral bioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food \ndoes not affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Peak plasma \nconcentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for \nhydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in oldersubjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary inolder people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n\u2022 kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n\u2022 slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n\u2022 stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n\u2022 decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan \n\n\n\n 48 \n\n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not \nrecommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage \nadjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary inolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended for use in children and adolescents \nbecause the safety and efficacy have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25aa Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n\u25aa Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u25aa Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n\u25aa Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n\u25aa Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\u25aa The concomitant use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products \n\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \u226530 ml/min but <60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, minimal or no \neffects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-\ncontaining salts substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is administered with \nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \nantiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after these medications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \n\nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 56 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried \nout in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended and alternative \ntreatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while \nnursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast feeding is not recommended. If Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used during \nbreast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is unlikely to affect \nthe ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken \ninto account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders: \nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \n\nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \n\nand unspecified (incl cysts and \n\npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanisme of action \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \n\n\n\n 60 \n\nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by \ncuff during office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva as initial therapy for severe \nhypertension (defined as SeDBP \u2265 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-\nblind, active-controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 \nratio to either irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and \nsystematically force-titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were \u2265 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were \u2265 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group that in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (\u226550,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, the absolute \noral bioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food \ndoes not affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Peak plasma \nconcentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for \nhydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary inolder people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n\u2022 kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n\u2022 slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n\u2022 stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in a \n\n6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n\u2022 decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\n \nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n\u2022 Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see sections 4.3, 4.4,  4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n 67 \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not \nrecommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage \nadjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended for use in children and adolescents \nbecause the safety and efficacy have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u25aa Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n\u25aa Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n\u25aa Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n\u25aa Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n\u25aa Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\u25aa The concomitant use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products \n\nis contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nclearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is \u226530 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance \u226530 ml/min but <60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, minimal or no \neffects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in \npatients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-\ncontaining salts substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is administered with \nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \nantiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after these medications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \n\nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 72 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried \nout in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) \n\n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended and alternative \ntreatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while \nnursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nduring breast feeding is not recommended. If Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used during \nbreast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is unlikely to affect \nthe ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken \ninto account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders: \nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions: \nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders: \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by \ncuff during office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nZentiva 150 mg/12.5 mg and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n\n\n\n 77 \n\n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva as initial therapy for severe \nhypertension (defined as SeDBP \u2265 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-\nblind, active-controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 \nratio to either irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and \nsystematically force-titrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were \u2265 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were \u2265 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) andVA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n\n\n\n 78 \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (\u226550,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, the absolute \noral bioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food \ndoes not affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. Peak plasma \nconcentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for \nhydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary inolder people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \n\n\n\n 79 \n\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n\u2022 kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n\u2022 slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n\u2022 stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n\u2022 decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\n \nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n3. How to take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant.

How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nZentiva in early pregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n\u25aa if you have difficulty in producing urine \n\u25aa if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva and if any of the following \napply to you: \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from liver problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from diabetes \n\u25aa if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n\u25aa if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \no aliskiren. \n\n\u25aa if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer).

How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in early pregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n\u25aa if you have difficulty in producing urine \n\u25aa if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 119 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva and if any of the following \napply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from liver problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from diabetes \n\u25aa if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n\u25aa if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the hormone \n\naldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood pressure). \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren. \n\u25aa if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \n\nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n\u25aa if you are on a low-salt diet \n\u25aa if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva) \n\n\u25aa if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  \n\u25aa if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva.

How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u25aa if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in early pregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n\u25aa if you have difficulty in producing urine \n\u25aa if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 127 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva and if any of the following \napply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from liver problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from diabetes \n\u25aa if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n\u25aa if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \no aliskiren. \n\n\u25aa if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n\u25aa if you are on a low-salt diet \n\u25aa if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva) \n\n\u25aa if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  \n\u25aa if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. This could be a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased \npressure in your eye(s). You should discontinue Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \ntreatment and seek medical attention. \n\n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva should not be given to children and adolescents \n(under 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n\n\n\n 128 \n\nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \nmay have an effect on other medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva without close supervision by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n\u25aa some laxatives \n\u25aa medicines for the treatment of gout \n\u25aa therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n\u25aa medicines to control heart rhythm \n\u25aa medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins)  \n\u25aa carbamazepine (a medicine for the treatment of epilepsy). \n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines, or colestyramine and colestipol \nresins for lowering blood cholesterol. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva, if you drink \nalcohol while on treatment with this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on \nstanding up, specially when getting up from a sitting position. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u25aa if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva in early pregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n\u25aa if you have difficulty in producing urine \n\u25aa if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in your \n\nblood \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n \n \n\n\n\n 135 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva and if any of the following \napply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from liver problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from diabetes \n\u25aa if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n\u25aa if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood pressure) \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren. \n\u25aa if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \n\nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n\n if you are on a low-salt diet \n\u25aa if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide Zentiva) \n\n\u25aa if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such \nas redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  \n\u25aa if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide Zentiva. This could be a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased \npressure in your eye(s).

Efficacy and safety of \n\nsartan-containing medicines in these indications are per se well-established and are not questioned \n\nin this referral. The key issue of this referral concerns the detection of N-nitrosamine (esp. NDMA \n\nand/or NDEA) contaminations in sartans, the resulting potential long-term risk to patients and \n\nmeasures to minimise as much as possible these contaminations. \n\nNitrosamines are chemically simple molecules and can be formed in pharmaceutical manufacturing \n\nsteps whenever there is a presence of a secondary (or tertiary) amines and nitrites, usually in \n\nacidic conditions. This is the background to the current referral procedure. However, it should be \n\nnoted that nitrosamines can also be formed in many other situations, including in biological \n\nprocesses.  \n\nNDMA and NDEA are two of the most potent mutagenic carcinogens known. As soon as the \n\nproblem of nitrosamine-contamination became known, immediate, precautionary measures were \n\ntaken by competent authorities across the EU such as recalls of affected batches from pharmacies. \n\nInitially, this was only necessary for valsartan containing APIs from few manufacturers but later \n\nalso for some other sartans with a tetrazole ring. \n\nAssessment of the excess risk of cancer  \n\nThe impact of NDMA and NDEA on human health is currently only extrapolated from animal \n\nstudies. However, as the DNA damage mechanisms documented in these studies are also relevant \n\nin humans and in vitro data in human cells are not significantly different from those in animal cells, \n\nit is prudent to assume that effects seen in animals may also occur in humans after exposure to \n\nsufficiently large amounts of these nitrosamines.  \n\nIn addition to NDMA and NDEA, other N-nitrosamines have been detected in a few sartan-\n\ncontaining medicinal products. Risks resulting from multiple exposures are considered to add up in \n\npatients as mutagenic carcinogens are currently considered as summation toxins. \n\nThe ICH M7(R1) guideline sets out principles for determining limits for mutagenic / DNA-reactive \n\nimpurities. The determination of an acceptable intake (AI) is based on extrapolation of carcinogenic \n\nrisk from rodent carcinogenicity data, as the dose resulting in one cancer case among 100,000 \n\nindividuals exposed for a life-time to the impurity. N-nitrosamines belong to a \u201ccohort of concern\u201d \n\ncompounds in this guideline. For these reasons, N-nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals such \n\nas sartans intended for long-term use should be reduced as much as possible. \n\nA full risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA and/or NDEA impurities in sartans, \n\nespecially valsartan which was found to contain the highest nitrosamine contamination, is not \n\npossible as the real extent of exposure of patients is unknown. For an individual risk assessment, \n\ndata on the exact drug products and batches used by each individual patient would be necessary. \n\nThus, the risk assessment is based on a potential worst case scenario, which would be a partially \n\ncombined exposure to the highest levels of NDEA for 4 years (2011 \u2013 2015) and to NDMA for 6 \n\nyears (2012 \u2013 2018) reported from a sartan, resulting in a cumulative theoretical excess cancer \n\nrisk of 29.5:100,000 or 1:3390 (0.029%) when extrapolated from the available rat studies \n\naccording to ICH M7(R1). Compared to the lifetime cancer risk in the European population of \n\napproximately 50%, this additional risk is considered to be very low.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 144 \n\n \n\nConsiderations on monitoring of exposed patients \n\nThe above stated very small theoretical risk has to be balanced against the risks of potential \n\nmeasures to monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy which may exceed the \n\ntheoretical excess cancer risk. For example, a recent review has estimated risks of perforation of 4 \n\nper 10,000 (95% confidence interval, 2-5) and major haemorrhage of 8 per 10,000 (95% \n\nconfidence interval, 5-14) with screening colonoscopy. In addition, advancing age, comorbidity and \n\nuse of anticoagulants were found to be strongly associated with both gastrointestinal and non-\n\ngastrointestinal complications. Furthermore, the target organ(s) of NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans \n\nare still not sufficiently clear.  \n\nFor these reasons, CHMP could not identify cancer screening methods that patients would benefit \n\nfrom.  \n\n \n\nMeasures to mitigate the risk \n\nAppropriate regulatory actions (such as quarantine or batch recalls) have been taken where \n\nrelevant. \n\nAdditional measures are needed to minimise prospectively the reoccurrence of such contamination. \n\nBased on all available data, the CHMP requires the following: \n\n1. Obligatory risk assessments to be performed for manufacturing processes of the drug \n\nsubstances in order to evaluate the theoretical risk of N-nitrosamine formation and contamination \n\n2. Modifying manufacturing processes, where necessary, to minimise contamination as much as \n\npossible. \n\n3. Implement a control strategy to detect and control N-nitrosamine impurities in the API (or \n\nintermediate, if justified). \n\nSpecifically, CHMP considered that NDMA and NDEA limits should be as low as technically possible. \n\nIn this regard, a limit of quantification of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA would be achievable \n\naccording to the available data on analytical methods. This limit is considered a sufficiently robust \n\nthreshold for APIs that can technically be reached. In comparison to the daily intake levels \n\ncalculated based on ICH M7(R1) using non-clinical toxicology, it is possible to generate additional \n\nsafety factors ranging from 2.73 \u2013 27.3 for NDMA and 10.0 \u2013 100 for NDEA, by defining 0.03 ppm \n\nas the common technical target limit for NDEA and NDMA in tetrazole sartan APIs. The underlying \n\nconcept of the proposed approach is to keep the amount of N-nitrosamine impurities as low as \n\npossible, irrespective of the type of sartan or dose. \n\nThe limit of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA will be enforceable after a transitional period of 2 years \n\nfrom the notification of the Commission Decision. During this time period, MAHs and manufacturers \n\nare requested to introduce relevant changes to the manufacturing processes of the drug \n\nsubstances, as well as develop appropriate analytical methods while ensuring adequate supply of \n\nthe market for these essential medicinal products. An interim limit based on daily intakes according \n\nto principles in ICH M7(R1) using toxicology data are set in order to control these impurities in the \n\nmeantime at an acceptable level. These interim limits are based on the maximum daily dose \n\nauthorised in the EU for each of the sartans and therefore vary between them, as outlined in the \n\ntable below: \n\n \n\n\n\n 145 \n\n \n\nDrug \n\nsubstance \n\nMax. daily \n\ndose (mg) \n\nNDEA   \n\nLimit in ppm \nin API \n\nNDMA  \n\n Limit in ppm \nin API \n\nValsartan 320 0.082  0.300 \n\nLosartan 150 0.177 0.640 \n\nOlmesartan 40 0.663 2.400 \n\nIrbesartan 300 0.088 0.320 \n\nCandesartan 32 0.820  3.000 \n\n \n\nShould NDMA and NDEA be detected in parallel in an API batch, this should lead to rejection of the \n\nrespective batch, considering that a combined contamination would translate into a combined risk, \n\nwhich may be higher than one additional case of cancer in 100.000 individuals. \n\nWhilst the measures are focused on NDMA and NDEA, the principles used in this procedure in terms \n\nof toxicology assessment, control strategy and changes to the manufacturing processes for drug \n\nsubstances should be applied by analogy to other nitrosamines. \n\nIn case of identification of other nitrosamines, this should be forthwith reported to the competent \n\nauthorities, together with a toxicology assessment of the impurity, a clinical assessment for the \n\nexposed patients, a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan (e.g. changes to the \n\nmanufacturing process). \n\n \n\nOverall, taking into account the available data assessed in this procedure, the benefit risk balance \n\nof medicines containing a sartan with a tetrazole ring remains positive subject to the conditions \n\nimposed. \n\n \n\nGrounds for CHMP opinion \n\nWhereas \n\n\u2022 The CHMP considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for products \n\ncontaining sartans with a tetrazole group (candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, \n\nvalsartan) \n\n\u2022 The CHMP reviewed data on quality regarding the manufacturing processes of sartans with \n\na tetrazole group, analytical data including test results and available methods, and \n\ntoxicological data available for the N-nitrosamines found in some of these products. The \n\nCHMP also carried out a risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA and \n\nNDEA in sartans and calculated daily intake levels based on the principles of ICH M7(R1) \n\nwhich are associated with an additional lifetime risk of 1 in 100,000 patients. \n\n\u2022 Based on the analysis of potential root causes the CHMP considered that all the MAHs \n\nshould perform risk assessment of the manufacturing processes used for the APIs in their \n\nfinished products to evaluate the risk of N-nitrosamine formation and contamination. \n\n\u2022 A two-year transition period) is considered acceptable to change production processes to \n\nachieve syntheses in which N-nitrosamines are not formed, to adopt analytical methods for \n\nthe control strategy and in order to avoid product shortages.  \n\n\u2022 During this period, NDMA and NDEA impurities in the API should be controlled for a \n\ntransition period at limits calculated based on the principles of ICH M7(R1) using validated \n\nassays \n\n\n\n 146 \n\n\u2022 After the transition period, a limit for NDMA and NDEA of maximum 0.03 ppm should be \n\nimplemented, which reflects the lowest quantifiable level based on capability of the \n\navailable analytical methods. \n\n\u2022 In case of detection of other N-nitrosamines this should be forthwith reported to the \n\ncompetent authorities, together with a toxicology assessment of the impurity, a clinical \n\nassessment for the exposed patients, a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan.  \n\n\u2022 CHMP could not identify cancer screening methods that patients would benefit from, \n\nconsidering the uncertainty of the target organ(s) of NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans and \n\nthe risks of measures to monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy which may \n\nexceed the theoretical excess cancer risk. \n\n \n\nCHMP opinion \n\nThe CHMP, as a consequence, considers that the benefit-risk balance of products containing \n\ncandesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, valsartan remains favourable subject to the \n\nconditions described above. \n\nTherefore the CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations for \n\nproducts containing candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, valsartan. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
