NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFampridine Accord 10 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 10 mg of fampridine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet. \n \nWhite to off white, oval shaped, biconvex, bevel-edged, film coated tablets, approximately \n13.1 x 8.1 mm in dimensions, debossed with \u2018FH6\u2019 on one side and plain on other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFampridine Accord is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple \nsclerosis with walking disability (EDSS 4-7). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Fampridine Accord is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians \nexperienced in the management of MS. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (one tablet in the \nmorning and one tablet in the evening). Fampridine Accord  should not be administered more \nfrequently or at higher doses than recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets should be taken without \nfood (see section 5.2). \n \nStarting and Evaluating Fampridine Accord  Treatment \n \n\u2022 Initial prescription should be limited to two to four weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should \n\ngenerally be identified within two to four weeks after starting  Fampridine Accord.   \n\u2022 An assessment of walking ability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) or Twelve Item \n\nMultiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), is recommended to evaluate improvement \nwithin two to four weeks. If no improvement is observed, Fampridine Accord should be \ndiscontinued \n\n\u2022 Fampridine Accord should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. \n \nRe-Evaluating Fampridine Accord Treatment \n \nIf decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in \norder to reassess the benefits of Fampridine Accord (see above). The re-evaluation should include \n\n\n\n3 \n\nwithdrawal of Fampridine Accord and performing an assessment of walking ability. Fampridine \nAccord should be discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit.   \n \nMissed dose \nThe usual dosing regimen should always be followed. A double dose should not be taken if a dose is \nmissed. \n \nElderly Renal function should be checked in  the elderly before starting treatment with Fampridine \nAccord. Monitoring renal function to detect any renal impairment is recommended in  the elderly (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \nFampridine Accord  is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance <50 ml/min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of fampridine  in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFampridine Accord is for oral use. \n \nThe tablet must be swallowed whole. It must not be divided, crushed, dissolved, sucked or chewed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to fampridine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine). \n \nPatients with prior history or current presentation of seizure. \n \nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). \n \nConcomitant use of Fampridine Accord with medicinal products that are inhibitors of Organic Cation \nTransporter 2 (OCT2) for example, cimetidine. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSeizure risk \n \nTreatment with fampridine increases seizure risk (see section 4.8). \n \nFampridine Accord should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may \nlower seizure threshold. \n \nFampridine Accord  should be discontinued in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nFampridine   is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment have \nhigher plasma concentrations which are associated with increased adverse reactions, in particular \n\n\n\n4 \n\nneurological effects. Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring during \ntreatment is recommended in all patients (particularly in  the elderly    in whom renal function might \nbe reduced). Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. \n \nCaution is required when Fampridine Accord  is prescribed in patients with mild renal impairment or \nin patients using medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol \nand metformin. \n \nHypersensitivity Reactions \n \nIn post-marketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) \nhave been reported, the majority of these cases occurred within the first week of treatment. Particular \nattention should be given to patients with a previous history of allergic reactions. If an anaphylactic or \nother serious allergic reaction occurs, Fampridine Accord should be discontinued and not restarted. \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \nFampridine Accord  should be administered with caution to patients with cardiovascular symptoms of \nrhythm and sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction cardiac disorders (these effects are seen in \noverdose). There is limited safety information in these patients. \n \nThe increased incidence of dizziness and balance disorder seen with fampridine may result in an \nincreased risk of falls. Therefore, patients should use walking aids as needed. \n \nIn clinical studies low white blood cell counts were seen in 2.1% of fampridine patients versus 1.9% \nof patients on placebo. Infections were seen in the clinical studies (see section 4.8) and increased \ninfection rate and impairment of the immune response cannot be excluded.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% \n(see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the \nconcomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, \ncimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol and metformin is cautioned \n(see section 4.4.) \n \nInterferon: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with interferon-beta and no \npharmacokinetic medicinal product interactions were observed. \n \nBaclofen: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with baclofen and no pharmacokinetic \nmedicinal product interactions were observed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is \npreferable to avoid the use of Fampridine Accord in pregnancy. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fampridine is excreted in human or animal milk. Fampridine Accord is not \nrecommended during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal studies no effects on fertility were seen. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFampridine Accord has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because \nfampridine can cause dizziness.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of fampridine has been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open label \nlong term studies and in the post marketing setting. \n \nAdverse reactions identified are mostly neurological and include seizure, insomnia, anxiety, balance \ndisorder, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremor, headache and asthenia. This is consistent with fampridine\u2019s \npharmacological activity. The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo-\ncontrolled trials in multiple sclerosis patients with fampridine given at the recommended dose, are \nreported as urinary tract infection (in approximately 12% of patients).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMedDRA SOC Adverse Reaction Frequency category \nInfections and infestations Urinary tract infection1 \n\nInfluenza1 \nNasopharyngitis1 \nViral infection1 \n\nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis \nAngioedema \nHypersensitivity \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia \nAnxiety \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness \nHeadache \nBalance disorder \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nSeizure3 \nExacerbation of trigeminal \nneuralgia \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n \n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations Common \n Tachycardia Uncommon \nVascular disorders Hypotension2 Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea Pharyngolaryngeal \npain \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nDyspepsia  \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash \nUrticaria \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nBack pain Common  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nAsthenia \nChest discomfort2 \n\nCommon \nUncommon \n\n1 See section 4.4 \n2 These symptoms were observed in the context of hypersensitivity \n3 See sections 4.3 and 4.4 \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIn post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions (including \nanaphylaxis) which have occurred with one or more of the following: dyspnoea, chest discomfort, \nhypotension, angioedema, rash and urticaria. For further information on hypersensitivity reactions, \nplease refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nAcute symptoms of overdose with fampridine were consistent with central nervous system excitation \nand included confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, and amnesia. \n \nCentral nervous system side effects at high doses of 4-aminopyridine include dizziness, confusion, \nseizures, status epilepticus, involuntary and choreoathetoid movements. Other side effects at high \ndoses include cases of cardiac arrhythmias (for example, supraventricular tachycardia and \nbradycardia) and ventricular tachycardia as a consequence of potential QT prolongation. Reports of \nhypertension have also been received. \n \nManagement \n \nPatients who overdose should be provided supportive care. Repeated seizure activity should be treated \nwith benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or other appropriate acute anti-seizure therapy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX07. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFampridine is a potassium channel blocker. By blocking potassium channels, fampridine  reduces the \nleakage of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing \naction potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by \nenhancing action potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous \nsystem. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThree phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled confirmatory studies, (MS-F203 and \nMS-F204 and 218MS305) have been performed. The proportion of responders was independent of \nconcomitant immunomodulatory therapy (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod and \nnatalizumab). The fampridine dose was 10 mg BID. \n \nStudies MS-F203 and MS-F204 \n \nThe primary endpoint in studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 was the responder rate in walking speed as \nmeasured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW). A responder was defined as a patient who \nconsistently had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double \nblind period as compared to the maximum value among five off-treatment visits. \n \nA significantly greater proportion of fampridine  treated patients were responders as compared to \nplacebo (MS-F203: 34.8% vs. 8.3%, p<0.001; MS-F204: 42.9% vs. 9.3%, p<0.001). \n \nPatients who responded to fampridine  increased their walking speed on average by 26.3% vs 5.3% on \nplacebo (p<0.001) (MS-F203) and 25.3% vs 7.8% (p< 0.001) (MS-F204). The improvement appeared \nrapidly (within weeks) after starting fampridine. \n \nStatistically and clinically meaningful improvements in walking were seen, as measured by the 12- \nitem Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTable 1: Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 \n \nSTUDY * MS-F203 MS-F204 \n     \n Placebo Fampridine \n\n10 mg BID \nPlacebo                                       \n\nmpridine10 mg BID \nn of subjects  72 224 118 119 \n\n     \nConsistent \nimprovement \n\n8.3% 34.8% 9.3% 42.9% \n\nDifference   26.5%  33.5% \nCI95% \n\nP-value \n 17.6%, 35.4% \n\n< 0.001 \n 23.2%, 43.9% \n\n< 0.001 \n \n\n\u226520% improvement 11.1% 31.7% 15.3% 34.5% \nDifference   20.6%  19.2% \n\nCI95% \nP-value \n\n 11.1%,30.1% \n<0.001 \n\n 8.5%,29.9% \n<0.001 \n\nWalking speed Feet/sec  Ft per sec  Ft per sec Ft per sec  Ft per sec \nBaseline  2.04 2.02 2.21 2.12 \nEndpoint 2.15 2.32 2.39 2.43 \n\nChange  0.11 0.30 0.18  0.31 \nDifference 0.19 0.12 \n\np-value 0.010 0.038 \nAverage  change 5.24 13.88 7.74 14.36 \n\nDifference 8.65 6.62 \np-value < 0.001 0.007 \n\nMSWS-12-score (mean, \nsem)  \n\n    \n\nBaseline 69.27 (2.22) 71.06 (1.34) 67.03 (1.90) 73.81 (1.87) \nAverage change -0.01 (1.46) -2.84 (0.878) 0.87 (1.22) -2.77 (1.20) \n\nDifference 2.83 3.65 \np-value 0.084 0.021 \n\nLEMMT (mean, sem) \n(Lower Extremity \nManual Muscle Test) \n\n    \n\nBaseline 3.92 (0.070) 4.01 (0.042) 4.01 (0.054) 3.95 (0.053) \nAverage change 0.05 (0.024) 0.13 (0.014) 0.05 (0.024) 0.10 (0.024) \n\nDifference 0.08 0.05 \np-value 0.003 0.106 \n\nAshworth Score \n(A test for muscle \nspasticity) \n\n    \n\nBaseline 0.98 (0.078) 0.95 (0.047) 0.79 (0.058) 0.87 (0.057) \nAverage change -0.09 (0.037) -0.18 (0.022) -0.07 (0.033) -0.17 (0.032) \n\nDifference 0.10 0.10 \np-value 0.021 0.015 \n\n \nStudy 218MS305 \n \nStudy 218MS305 was conducted in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. \nDuration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post\u2013treatment follow-up. The \nprimary endpoint was improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients \n\n\n\n9 \n\nachieving a mean improvement of \u2265 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks. In this \nstudy there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of fampridine \ntreated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled \npatients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]). Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 \nweeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. \n \nFampridine treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up \nand Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary \nendpoint, a greater proportion of fampridine treated patients achieved \u2265 15% mean improvement from \nbaseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo. The difference in the Berg Balance \nScale (BBS; a measure of static balance), was not statistically significant. \n \nIn addition, patients treated with fampridine  demonstrated a statistically significant mean \nimprovement from baseline compared to placebo in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) \nphysical score (LSM difference -3.31, p<0.001). \n \nTable 2: Study 218MS305 \n \nOver 24 weeks Placebo \n\nN = 318* \nFampridine \n10 mg BID \nN = 315* \n\nDifference (95% CI) \nP - value \n\nProportion of patients with \nmean improvement of \u2265 8 \npoints from baseline \nMSWS-12 score \n \n\n34% 43% \n \n\nRisk difference: 10.4% \n(3% ; 17.8%) \n\n0.006 \n\nMSWS-12 score \nBaseline \nImprovement from \nbaseline \n\n \n65.4 \n-2.59 \n\n \n63.6 \n-6.73 \n\nLSM: -4.14 \n(-6.22 ; -2.06) \n\n<0.001 \n \n\nTUG \nProportion of patients with \nmean improvement of \u2265 15% \nin TUG speed \n \n\n35% 43% \n \n\nRisk difference: 9.2% \n(0.9% ; 17.5%) \n\n0.03 \n\nTUG \nBaseline \nImprovement from \nbaseline (sec) \n\n \n27.1 \n-1.94 \n\n \n24.9 \n-3.3 \n\nLSM: -1.36 \n(-2.85 ; 0.12) \n\n0.07 \n\nMSIS-29 physical score \nBaseline \nImprovement from \nbaseline \n\n55.3 \n-4.68 \n\n52.4 \n-8.00 \n\n \n\nLSM: -3.31 \n(-5.13 ; -1.50) \n\n<0.001 \n\nBBS score \nBaseline \nImprovement from \nbaseline \n\n \n40.2 \n1.34 \n\n \n40.6 \n1.75 \n\n \n\nLSM: 0.41 \n(-0.13 ; 0.95) \n\n0.141 \n\n*Intent to treat population = 633; LSM = Least square mean \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing fampridine in all subsets of the paediatric population in \ntreatment of multiple sclerosis with walking disability (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: \n \nOrally administered fampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. \nFampridine has a narrow therapeutic index. Absolute bioavailability of fampridine prolonged-release \ntablets has not been assessed, but relative bioavailability (as compared to an aqueous oral solution) is \n95%. The fampridine  prolonged-release tablet has a delay in the absorption of fampridine manifested \nby slower rise to a lower peak concentration, without any effect on the extent of absorption. \n \nWhen fampridine  tablets are taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve (AUC0-\u221e) of fampridine is approximately 2-7% (10 mg dose). The small \nreduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. However, Cmax \nincreases by 15-23%. Since there is a clear relationship between Cmax and dose related adverse \nreactions, it is recommended to take fampridine  without food (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution: \n \nFampridine is a lipid-soluble medicinal product which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. \nFampridine is largely unbound to plasma proteins (bound fraction varied between 3-7% in human \nplasma). Fampridine has a volume of distribution of approximately 2.6 l/kg. \nFampridine is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation: \n \nFampridine is metabolised in humans by oxidation to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and further \nconjugated to the 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate. No pharmacological activity was found for the \nfampridine metabolites against selected potassium channels in vitro. \n \nThe 3-hydroxylation of fampridine to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine by human liver microsomes \nappeared to be catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). \n \nThere was evidence of direct inhibition of CYP2E1 by fampridine at 30 \u03bcM (approximately 12% \ninhibition) which is approximately 100 times the average plasma fampridine concentration measured \nfor the 10 mg tablet. \n \nTreatment of cultured human hepatocytes with fampridine had little or no effect on induction of \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5 enzyme activities. \n \nElimination: \n \nThe major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with approximately 90% of the dose \nrecovered in urine as parent medicinal product within 24 hours. Renal clearance (CLR 370 ml/min) is \nsubstantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined glomerular filtration and active \nexcretion by the renal OCT2 transporter. Faecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the \nadministered dose. \n \nFampridine is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) pharmacokinetics with a terminal \nelimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a \nsmaller extent, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with \ndose. There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of fampridine taken at the \nrecommended dose in patients with full renal function. In patients with renal impairment, \naccumulation occurs relative to the degree of impairment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nElderly: \n \nFampridine is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, and with creatinine clearance known to \ndecrease with age, monitoring of renal function in elderly patients is recommended (see section 4.2).  \n \nPaediatric population: \n \nNo data are available. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: \n \nFampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged medicinal product and therefore renal \nfunction should be checked in patients where renal function might be compromised. Patients with \nmild renal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times the fampridine \nconcentrations achieved by patients with normal renal function. Fampridine Accord must not be \nadministered to patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFampridine was studied in oral repeat dose toxicity studies in several animal species. \n \nAdverse responses to orally administered fampridine were rapid in onset, most often occurring within \nthe first 2 hours post-dose. Clinical signs evident after large single doses or repeated lower doses were \nsimilar in all species studied and included tremors, convulsions, ataxia, dyspnoea, dilated pupils, \nprostration, abnormal vocalization, increased respiration, and excess salivation. Gait abnormalities \nand hyper-excitability were also observed. These clinical signs were not unexpected and represent \nexaggerated pharmacology of fampridine. In addition, single cases of fatal urinary tract obstructions \nwere observed in rats. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated, but a causal \nrelationship with fampridine treatment cannot be excluded. \n \nIn reproduction toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, decreased weight and viability of foetuses and \noffspring were observed at maternally toxic doses. However, no increased risk for malformations or \nadverse effects on fertility was noted. \n \nIn a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies fampridine did not show any potential to be mutagenic, \nclastogenic or carcinogenic. \n \n \n6.

They work by stopping potassium leaving the nerve cells which \nhave been damaged by MS. This medicine is thought to work by letting signals pass down the nerve \nmore normally, which allows you to walk better. \n \n \n2.
