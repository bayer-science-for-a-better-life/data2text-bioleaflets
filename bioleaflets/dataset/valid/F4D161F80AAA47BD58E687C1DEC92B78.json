CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  \n \nPandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account available data from: \n \n\u2022 Ongoing clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose of Arepanrix (H1N1) \n\u2022 Clinical studies in healthy subjects (including elderly subjects) who received two doses of a \n\nversion of Arepanrix containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  3 \n\nAnd also from: \n \n\u2022 On-going clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose or two doses of an \n\nAS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process \n\u2022 Clinical studies in healthy subjects who received two doses of an AS03-containing vaccine \n\ncontaining HA from H5N1 manufactured using a different process. \n \nIn some age groups there are limited clinical study data (adults aged 60-79 years and children aged 10 \nto 17 years), very limited clinical study data (adults aged 80 years and older, children aged 6 months to \n9 years) or no data (children aged less than 6 months) with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H5N1 or from H1N1v manufactured using a different process as detailed in sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.1. \n \nAdults aged 18-60 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Arepanrix (H1N1) in clinical \nstudies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand the second dose. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine \ncontaining HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that a \nsingle dose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand the second dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 10-17 years \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine \ncontaining HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that \ndosing may be in accordance with the recommendations for adults.   \n \nChildren aged from 6 months to 9 years \nOne dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date.  \nPreliminary immunogenicity data obtained with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v manufactured using a different process in a limited number of children aged 6-35 months \nshow that there is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval \nof three weeks. \n \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 \nand 5.1. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Arepanrix should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Arepanrix (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine. If \nvaccination is considered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available \nin case of need. \n \nSee section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nArepanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Arepanrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need \nto assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThere are no safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with Arepanrix or with an \nAS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in \nchildren aged less than 6 months. There are limited data available from a clinical study with an AS03-\ncontaining vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy \nchildren aged from 10 to 17 years, very limited data with the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy children aged from 6 to 35 months and \nlimited data from a study with a version of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 \nmanufactured using a different process in children aged from 3 to 9 years. \n \nVery limited data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process in children aged 6 to 35 months (N=51) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of \nthe adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses indicate an increase in the rates of injection \nsite reactions and general symptoms (see section 4.8).  In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature \n\u226538\u00b0C) may increase considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and \nmeasures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are \nrecommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) after each vaccination. \n \nThere are limited data available from clinical studies with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA \nfrom H1N1v manufactured using a different process in adults aged over 60 years and very limited data \nin adults aged over 80 years.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  5 \n\nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Arepanrix with \nother H1N1 pandemic vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData obtained on co-administration of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v \nmanufactured using a different process with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a \nsplit virion vaccine) in healthy adults aged over 60 years did not suggest any significant interference in \nthe immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v. The immune \nresponse to Fluarix was satisfactory.   Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local \nor systemic reactions compared to administration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v alone.  \nTherefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nData obtained on the administration of a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a split \nvirion vaccine) three weeks before a dose of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v \nmanufactured using a different process in healthy adults over 60 years of age, did not suggest any \nsignificant interference in the immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v. Therefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be administered three weeks after the \nadministration of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with \nanother vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are currently no data available on the use of Arepanrix in pregnancy. Data from pregnant \nwomen vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest \nmalformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nAnimal studies with Arepanrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Arepanrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking \ninto account official recommendations. \n \nArepanrix may be used in lactating women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive \nor operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\u2022 Clinical trials \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  6 \n\n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in approximately 4,500 subjects 18 \nyears old and above who received a version of Arepanrix containing 3.75 microgram HA derived from \nA/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: lymphadenopathy \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nUncommon: dizziness, paraesthesia \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: vertigo \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: dyspnoea \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea, diarrhoea \nUncommon: abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, stomach discomfort \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: pruritus, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: joint pain, muscle aches \nUncommon: back pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, neck pain, muscle spasms, pain in extremity \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: pain at the injection site, fatigue \nCommon: redness at the injection site, swelling at the injection site, fever, shivering  \nUncommon: injection site reactions (such as bruising, induration, pruritus, warmth), asthenia, chest \npain, malaise \n \nAdditional data on reactogenicity are available from clinical studies in healthy subjects of various age \ngroups from 6 months of age upwards who received an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from \nH1N1v manufactured using a different process.

Control groups included ferrets \nimmunized with adjuvant alone and non-adjuvanted vaccine (7.5 micrograms HA). Ferrets immunized \nwith the non adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine were not protected from death and showed similar \nlung viral loads and degree of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract as those exhibited by ferrets \nimmunized with the adjuvant alone. Conversely the combination of a range of doses of H5N1 antigen \nwith AS03 adjuvant was able to protect against mortality and to reduce lung virus loads and viral \nshedding after intra-tracheal challenge with a homologous wild type H5N1 virus.  Serological testing \nindicated a direct correlation between vaccines induced HI and neutralising antibody titres in protected \nanimals compared to antigen and adjuvant controls. \n \n- Challenge with a heterologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Hong Kong/156/97) \n\nIn this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with \nvaccine candidate containing four different doses of H5N1 antigen (3.75, 1.5, 0.6 and 0.24 \u00b5g of HA \nantigen) adjuvanted with half dose of AS03. In addition, one group of six ferrets were immunized with \nvaccine candidate containing 3.75 \u00b5g H5N1 + full dose of AS03 and one control group included \nferrets immunized with non-adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 micrograms HA). The results of this \nheterologous challenge study indicate 80.7%-100% protection in all adjuvanted candidate vaccines \ncompared to 43% protection with the non adjuvanted vaccine, showing the benefit of AS03 \nadjuvantation. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  15 \n\nNon-clinical data obtained with a version of Arepanrix containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal \nand postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). \n \n \n6.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature.  Whitish sediments may be observed in the suspension vial; \nthese sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of the suspension.  The emulsion \npresents as a whitish appearance. \n\n2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than \nthe white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of \neither being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen.  \n\n4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the \nvaccine. \n\n5. The volume of the Arepanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). \n\n6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly.  \n\n8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25\u00b0C. If the mixed vaccine is \nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature before each withdrawal. \n\n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

The MAH should check regarding the possible confounding layouts with other \npandemic vaccine supplied in EU. \n\n \n\u2022 The Applicant/MAH shall agree with Member States on mechanisms allowing patients and \n\nhealth care professionals to have continuous access to updated information regarding Arepanrix.   \n \n\u2022 The Applicant/MAH shall agree with Member Sates on the provision of a targeted \n\ncommunication to healthcare professionals which should address the following: \n \n\n\u2022 The correct way to prepare the vaccine prior to administration. \n \n\u2022 Adverse events to be prioritised for reporting, i.e. fatal and life-threatening adverse \n\nreactions, unexpected severe adverse reactions, adverse events of special interest (AESI). \n \n\u2022 The minimal data elements to be transmitted in individual case safety reports in order to \n\nfacilitate the evaluation and the identification of the vaccine administered to each subject, \nincluding the invented name, the vaccine manufacturer and the batch number. \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  19 \n\n \n\u2022 If a specific notification system has been put in place, how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n \n\u2022 OTHER CONDITIONS \n \nOfficial batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official \nbatch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. \n \nPharmacovigilance system \nThe MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 3.05 (dated \nSeptember 2009) presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation application, is in place and \nfunctioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains \nin use. \n \nPSUR submission during the influenza pandemic:  \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified \nin Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a \npandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.  Such \nsituation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for \nbenefit-risk balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of the \nextent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be \nvaccinated.  The MAH shall submit on a monthly basis a simplified periodic safety update report with \nthe timelines, format and content as defined in the CHMP Recommendations for the \nPharmacovigilance Plan as part of the Risk Management Plan to be submitted with the Marketing \nAuthorisation Application for a Pandemic Influenza Vaccine (EMEA/359381/2009) and any \nsubsequent update. \n \nRisk Management Plan \nThe MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in \nthe Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 4 (dated January 2010) of the Risk Management Plan \n(RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent \nupdates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. \n \n \nC.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for \n2. Before you receive Arepanrix \n3. How Arepanrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Arepanrix \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for \n \nArepanrix is a vaccine against a pandemic influenza (flu).  \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but may be more severe. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Arepanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. Before you are given Arepanrix \n \nYou should not receive Arepanrix: \n \n\u2022 if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nArepanrix (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be \npresent in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or \nsodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be \nappropriate for you to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is \nimmediately available in case of an allergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nTake special care with Arepanrix: \n \n\u2022 if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\nhttp://www.emea.europa.eu/\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  35 \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, \nformaldehyde  or to sodium deoxycholate. (see section 6. Further information). \n\n\u2022 if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with Arepanrix. \n\n\u2022 if you have a poor immune response (as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer), \n\n\u2022 if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Arepanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Arepanrix. \n\nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nIf your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after \nthe second dose, especially temperature over 38\u00b0C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures \nto lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each \ndose are recommended.  \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. \n \nAreapanrix can be given at the same time as seasonal influenza vaccines that do not contain an \nadjuvant. \n \nPersons who have received a seasonal influenza vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant may receive \nArepanrix after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nThere is no information on administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines and no information on \nadministration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process with any other vaccines than non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. However, if \nthis cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.  In such cases, you should \nbe aware that the side effects may be more intense.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant. You should \ndiscuss with your doctor whether you should receive Arepanrix. \nThe vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Arepanrix \nThis vaccine contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an \nallergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium \n(39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  36 \n\n3. How Arepanrix is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \n \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).  \n \nAdults including the elderly and children from the age of 10 years onwards: \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given \nClinical data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a \ndifferent process suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren from 6 months to 9 years of age \nA dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine will be given.  \nIf a second dose of 0.25 ml is given this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose.  \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months of age \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Arepanrix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Arepanrix (and not another vaccine \nagainst H1N1) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Arepanrix can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Arepanrix (H5N1) in clinical studies in adults, \nincluding the elderly. In these clinical studies most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \nThe side-effects are generally similar to those related to seasonal flu vaccines.  \n \nThese side effects have also been observed with similar frequencies in clinical studies in adults \nincluding the elderly and in children aged 10 to 17 years with a similar vaccine (H1N1), except for \nredness (uncommon in the adults and common in the elderly) and fever (uncommon in the adults and \nelderly). Gastro-intestinal symptoms and shivering were at a higher rate in the children 10-17 years of \nage. In children aged 3-9 years who received a first half adult dose of a similar vaccine (H1N1), the \nside effects were similar compared to the side effects reported in adults, with the exception of \nshivering, sweating and gastro-intestinal symptoms which were reported at a higher rate in children \naged 3 to 9 years. Additionally, in children aged 3 to 5 years of age, drowsiness, irritability and loss of \nappetite were reported very commonly. \n \nVery common: \n\u2022 Pain at the injection site \n\n\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n \n \n\n  37 \n\n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Tiredness \n\u2022 Aching muscles, joint pain \n \nCommon: \n\u2022 Redness and swelling at the injection site \n\u2022 Fever \n\u2022 Sweating \n\u2022 Shivering \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, feeling sick \n \nUncommon: \n\u2022 Reactions at the injection site such as bruising, hard lump, itching, warmth \n\u2022 Swollen glands in the axilla \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Generally feeling unwell \n\u2022 Unusual weakness  \n\u2022 Being sick, stomach pain, acid indigestion \n\u2022 Inability to sleep \n\u2022 Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet \n\u2022 Shortness of breath \n\u2022 Pain in the chest \n\u2022 Itching, rash \n\u2022 Pain in the back or neck, stiffness in the muscles, muscle spasms, pain in extremity such as leg \n\nor hand \n \nIn children aged 6-35 months who received a half of the adult dose (0.25 ml) of a similar vaccine \n(H1N1), fever and irritability occurred more often compared to the children 3-9 years who received a \nhalf of the adult dose (0.25 ml) of a similar vaccine (H5N1). \n \nIn children aged 6-35 months who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) the side \neffects after the second dose were more intense, especially fever (\u226538\u00b0C), which occurred very \ncommonly.  \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1 to 2 days without treatment.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature. Whitish sediments may be observed in the suspension vial; \nthese sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of the suspension.  The emulsion \npresents as a whitish appearance \n\n2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than \nthe white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of \neither being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen.  \n\n4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the \nvaccine. \n\n5. The volume of the Arepanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 \u201cHow Arepanrix is \ngiven\u201d). \n\n6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly. \n\n8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25\u00b0C. If the mixed vaccine is \nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature before each withdrawal. \n\n \nThe vaccine should not be administered intravascularly. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
