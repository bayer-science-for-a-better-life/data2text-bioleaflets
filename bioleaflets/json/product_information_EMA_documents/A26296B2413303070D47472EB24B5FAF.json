NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTasmar 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg tolcapone. \n\nExcipients with known effect: Each tablet contains 7.5 mg lactose  \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\nPale to light yellow, hexagonal, biconvex, film-coated tablet. “TASMAR” and “100” are engraved on \n\none side.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTasmar is indicated in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in \n\npatients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to \n\nrespond to or are intolerant of other catechol-O-methyltransferase COMT inhibitors (see section 5.1). \n\nBecause of the risk of potentially fatal, acute liver injury, Tasmar should not be considered as a first-\n\nline adjunct therapy to levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSince Tasmar should be used only in combination with levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa, \n\nthe prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is also applicable to their concomitant use \n\nwith Tasmar. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety \n\nor efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) \n\nTasmar is contraindicated for patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment (see section 5.2) \n\nNo dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment \n\n(creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min or greater). Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone \n\nin these populations is available (see section 5.2) \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe administration of Tasmar is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced \n\nin the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTasmar is administered orally three times daily. \n\nTasmar may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nTasmar tablets are film-coated and should be swallowed whole because tolcapone has a bitter taste. \n\n \n\nTasmar can be combined with all pharmaceutical formulations of levodopa/benserazide and \n\nlevodopa/carbidopa (see also section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe first dose of the day of Tasmar should be taken together the first dose of the day of a levodopa \n\npreparation, and the subsequent doses should be given approximately 6 and 12 hours later. Tasmar \n\nmay be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\nThe recommended dose of Tasmar is 100 mg three times daily, always as an adjunct to \n\nlevodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Only in exceptional circumstances, when the \n\nanticipated incremental clinical benefit justifies the increased risk of hepatic reactions, should the dose \n\nbe increased to 200 mg three times daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If substantial clinical benefits are \n\nnot seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment (regardless of dose) Tasmar should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\nThe maximum therapeutic dose of 200 mg three times daily should not be exceeded, as there is no \n\nevidence of additional efficacy at higher doses. \n\n \n\nLiver function should be checked before starting treatment with Tasmar and then monitored every 2 \n\nweeks for the first year of therapy, every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. \n\nIf the dose is increased to 200 mg tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the \n\ndose and then be reinitiated following the same sequence of frequencies as above (see sections  4.4 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nTasmar treatment should also be discontinued if ALT (alanine amino transferase) and/or AST \n\n(aspartate amino transferase) exceed the upper limit of normal or symptoms or signs suggest the onset \n\nof hepatic failure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLevodopa adjustments during Tasmar treatment:  \n\nAs Tasmar decreases the breakdown of levodopa in the body, side effects due to increased levodopa \n\nconcentrations may occur when beginning Tasmar treatment. In clinical trials, more than 70 % of \n\npatients required a decrease in their daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa was >600 mg \n\nor if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment. \n\nThe average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 30 % in those patients requiring a levodopa \n\ndose reduction. When beginning Tasmar, all patients should be informed of the symptoms of excessive \n\nlevodopa dose and what to do if it occurs. \n\nLevodopa adjustments when Tasmar is discontinued:  \n\nThe following suggestions are based on pharmacological considerations and have not been evaluated \n\nin clinical trials. Levodopa dose should not be decreased when Tasmar therapy is being discontinued \n\ndue to side effects related to too much levodopa. However, when Tasmar therapy is being \n\ndiscontinued for reasons other than too much levodopa, levodopa  dosemay have to be increased to \n\nlevels equal to or greater than before initiation of Tasmar therapy, especially if the patient had large \n\ndecreases in levodopa when starting Tasmar. In all cases, patients should be educated on the \n\nsymptoms of levodopa under-dose and what to do if it occurs. Adjustments in levodopa are most likely \n\nto be required within 1-2 days of Tasmar discontinuation. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to tolcapone or any of its other ingredients listed in section 6.1. \n\n• Evidence of liver disease or increased liver enzymes \n\n• Severe dyskinesia \n\n•   A previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex  and /or  \n\n            non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis or Hyperthermia. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Phaeochromocytoma. \n\n•   Treatment with non-selective mono amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTasmar therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of advanced \n\nParkinson’s disease, to ensure an appropriate risk-benefit assessment. Tasmar should not be prescribed \n\nuntil there has been a complete informative discussion of the risks with the patient. \n\n \n\nTasmar should be discontinued if substantial clinical benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the \n\ninitiation of the treatment regardless of dose. \n\n \n\nLiver injury: \n\nBecause of the risk of rare but potentially fatal acute liver injury, Tasmar is only indicated for use in \n\npatients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to \n\nrespond to or are intolerant of other COMT inhibitors. Periodic monitoring of liver enzymes cannot \n\nreliably predict the occurrence of fulminant hepatitis. However, it is generally believed that early \n\ndetection of medicine-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect \n\nmedication enhances the likelihood for recovery. Liver injury has most often occurred between 1 \n\nmonth and 6 months after starting treatment with Tasmar. Additionally late onset hepatitis after \n\napproximately 18 months of treatment has been reported rarely.  \n\nIt should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver injury (see  section 4.8). \n\n \n\nBefore starting treatment: If liver function tests are abnormal or there are signs of impaired liver \n\nfunction, Tasmar should not be prescribed. If Tasmar is to be prescribed, the patient should be \n\ninformed about the signs and symptoms which may indicate liver injury, and to contact the physician \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\nDuring treatment: Liver function should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first year of therapy, \n\nevery 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. If the dose is increased to 200 mg \n\ntid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be re-initiated \n\nfollowing the sequence of frequencies as above. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if \n\nALT and/or AST exceed the upper limit of normal or if symptoms or signs suggesting the onset of \n\nhepatic failure (persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper \n\nquadrant tenderness) develop. \n\n \n\nIf treatment is discontinued: Patients who show evidence of acute liver injury while on Tasmar and are \n\nwithdrawn from the medicinal product  may be at increased risk for liver injury if Tasmar is re-\n\nintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment. \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): \n\nIn Parkinson`s patients, NMS tends to occur when discontinuing or stopping dopaminergic-enhancing \n\nmedications. Therefore, if symptoms occur after discontinuing Tasmar, physicians should consider \n\nincreasing the patient’s levodopa dose (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIsolated cases consistent with NMS have been associated with Tasmar treatment. Symptoms have \n\nusually onset during Tasmar treatment or shortly after Tasmar has been discontinued. NMS is \n\ncharacterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus and tremor), mental status changes (agitation, \n\nconfusion, stupor and coma), elevated temperature, autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, \n\ntachycardia) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) which may be a consequence of \n\nmyolysis. A diagnosis of NMS should be considered even if not all the above findings are present. \n\nUnder such a diagnosis Tasmar should be immediately discontinued and the patient should be \n\nfollowed up closely.  \n\n \n\nBefore starting treatment: To reduce the risk of NMS, Tasmar should not be prescribed for patients \n\nwith severe dyskinesia or a previous history of NMS including rhabdomyolysis or hyperthermia (see \n\nsection 4.3). Patients receiving multiple medications with effects on different central nervous system \n\n\n\n5 \n\n(CNS) pathways (e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticholinergics) may be at greater risk of \n\ndeveloping NMS.  \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders: Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse \n\ncontrol disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse \n\ncontrol disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \n\nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Tasmar in association with levodopa. Review \n\nof treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop. \n\n \n\nDyskinesia, nausea and other levodopa-associated adverse reactions: Patients may experience an \n\nincrease in levodopa-associated adverse reactions. Reducing the dose of levodopa (see section 4.2) \n\nmay often mitigate these adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: In clinical trials, diarrhoea developed in 16 % and 18 % of patients receiving Tasmar \n\n100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, compared to 8 % of patients receiving placebo. Diarrhoea \n\nassociated with Tasmar usually began 2 to 4 months after initiation of therapy. Diarrhoea led to \n\nwithdrawal of 5% and 6% of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, \n\ncompared to 1 % of patients receiving placebo. \n\n \n\nBenserazide interaction: Due to the interaction between high dose benserazide and tolcapone (resulting \n\nin increased levels of benserazide), the prescriber should, until more experience has been gained, be \n\nobservant of dose-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMAO inhibitors: Tasmar should not be given in conjunction with non-selective monoamine oxidase \n\n(MAO) inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine and tranylcypromine). The combination of MAO-A and MAO-B \n\ninhibitors is equivalent to non-selective MAO-inhibition, therefore they should not both be given \n\nconcomitantly with Tasmar and levodopa preparations (see also section 4.5). Selective MAO-B \n\ninhibitors should not be used at higher than recommended doses (e.g. selegiline 10 mg/day) when co-\n\nadministered with Tasmar.  \n\n \n\nWarfarin: Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, \n\ncoagulation parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations: Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) should \n\nbe treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone in these populations is \n\navailable (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance: Tasmar contains lactose. Patients with hereditary problems of galactose \n\nintolerance, the Lapp lactose deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nTasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-adminstered levodopa. \n\nThe consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic adverse reactions \n\nobserved after treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, \n\nnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, \n\nsomnolence, hallucination. \n\n \n\nLevodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \n\nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very \n\nrarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating \n\nmachines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an \n\nepisode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines (see section 4.7). \n\nFurthermore a reduction of levodopa  dose or termination of therapy may be considered.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCatechols and other drugs metabolised by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT): Tolcapone may \n\ninfluence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolised by COMT. No effects were seen on the \n\npharmacokinetics of the COMT substrate carbidopa. An interaction was observed with benserazide, \n\nwhich may lead to increased levels of benserazide and its active metabolite. The magnitude of the \n\neffect was dependent on the dose of benserazide. The plasma concentrations of benserazide observed \n\nafter co-administration of tolcapone and benserazide-25 mg/levodopa were still within the range of \n\nvalues observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. On the other hand, after co-administration of \n\ntolcapone and benserazide-50 mg/levodopa the benserazide plasma concentrations could be increased \n\nabove the levels usually observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. The effect of tolcapone on the \n\npharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolised by COMT such as -methyldopa, dobutamine, \napomorphine, adrenaline and isoprenaline have not been evaluated. The prescriber should be observant \n\nof adverse reactions caused by putative increased plasma levels of these drugs when combined with \n\nTasmar. \n\n \n\nEffect of tolcapone on the metabolism of other drugs: Due to its affinity for cytochrome CYP2C9 in \n\nvitro, tolcapone may interfere with drugs whose clearance is dependent on this metabolic pathway, \n\nsuch as tolbutamide and warfarin. In an interaction study, tolcapone did not change the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions involving cytochrome \n\nCYP2C9 appear unlikely. \n\n \n\nSince clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation \n\nparameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. \n\n \n\nDrugs that increase catecholamines: Since tolcapone interferes with the metabolism of catecholamines, \n\ninteractions with other drugs affecting catecholamine levels are theoretically possible. \n\n \n\nWhen Tasmar was given together with levodopa/carbidopa and desipramine, there was no significant \n\nchange in blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma concentrations of desipramine. Overall, the frequency \n\nof adverse reactions increased slightly. These adverse reactions were predictable based on the known \n\nadverse reactions to each of the three drugs individually. Therefore, caution should be exercised when \n\npotent noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline, or venlafaxine are \n\nadministered to Parkinson’s disease patients being treated with Tasmar and levodopa preparations. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, patients receiving Tasmar/levodopa preparations reported a similar adverse reaction \n\nprofile independent of whether or not they were also concomitantly administered selegiline (a MAO-B \n\ninhibitor). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of tolcapone in pregnant women. Therefore, Tasmar should \n\nbe used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIn animal studies, tolcapone was excreted into maternal milk. \n\nThe safety of tolcapone in infants is unknown; therefore, women should not breast-feed during \n\ntreatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIn rats and rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity was observed after tolcapone administration (see section \n\n5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects of Tasmar on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThere is no evidence from clinical studies that Tasmar adversely influences a patient’s ability to drive \n\nand use machines. However patients should be advised that their ability to drive and operate machines \n\nmay be compromised due to their Parkinson’s disease symptoms.  \n\n \n\nTasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-adminstered levodopa. \n\nThe consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects \n\nobserved after treatment with COMT inhibitors. Patients being treated with Levodopa and presenting \n\nwith somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging \n\nin activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death \n\n(e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section \n\n4.4)  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Tasmar, occurring more \n\nfrequently than in placebo-treated patients are listed in the table below. However, Tasmar, as a COMT \n\ninhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered levodopa. The consequent \n\nincrease in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects observed after \n\ntreatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, nausea, \n\nvomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, somnolence, \n\nhallucination. \n\n \n\nThe only adverse reactions commonly leading to discontinuation of Tasmar in clinical trials was \n\ndiarrhoea (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nVery common (≥1/10) \n\nCommon (≥1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nRare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) \n\nVery rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \n\nExperience with Tasmar obtained in parallel placebo-controlled randomised studies in patients with \n\nParkinson’s disease is shown in the following table, which lists adverse reactions with a potential \n\nrelationship to Tasmar. \n\n \n\nSummary of potentially Tasmar-related adverse reactions, with crude incidence rates for the phase III \n\nplacebo-controlled studies: \n\n \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nIncidence \n\n \n\nAdverse Events \n\nInfections and infestations Common Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very common Sleep disorder \n\n  Dreaming excessive \n\n  Somnolence \n\n  Confusion \n\n  Hallucination \n\n Rare Impulse control disorders* \n\n(Libido increased, hypersexuality, \n\npathological gambling, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating, \n\ncompulsive eating (see section 4.4)) \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Dyskinesia \n\n  Dystonia \n\n  Headache \n\n  Dizziness \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nIncidence \n\n \n\nAdverse Events \n\n  Somnolence \n\n  Orthostatic complaints \n\n Rare Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \n\nSymptom Complex (see section 4.4) \n\n Common Hypokinesia \n\n   \n\n  Syncope \n\n   \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea \n\n   \n\n  Diarrhoea \n\n Common Vomiting \n\n  Constipation \n\n  Xerostomia \n\n  Abdominal pain \n\n  Dyspepsia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Sweating increased \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Urine discoloration \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Chest pain \n\n  Influenza like illness \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Hepatocellular injury, in rare \n\ncases with fatal outcome* \n\n(see section 4.4) \n\nInvestigations Common Increase of alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT) \n\n \n\n*: Adverse reactions for which no frequency could be derived from clinical studies (i.e. where a \n\nspecific adverse reaction was not observed in clinical trials but was reported post-marketing only) \n\nare indicated by an asterisk (*), and the frequency category has been calculated according to EU \n\nGuideline. \n \n\n \n\nIncrease of alanine aminotransferase \n\nIncreases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in alanine aminotransferase \n\n(ALT)occurred in 1 % of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg three times daily, and 3 % of patients at \n\n200 mg three times daily. Increases were approximately two times more likely in females. The \n\nincreases usually appeared within 6 to 12 weeks of starting treatment, and were not associated with \n\nany clinical signs or symptoms. In about half the cases, transaminase levels returned spontaneously to \n\nbaseline values whilst patients continued Tasmar treatment. For the remainder, when treatment was \n\ndiscontinued, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels. \n\n \n\nHepatocellular injury \n\nRare cases of severe hepatocellular injury resulting in death have been reported during marketed use \n\n(see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex \n\n\n\n9 \n\nIsolated cases of patients with symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom \n\nComplex (see section 4.4) have been reported following reduction or discontinuation of Tasmar and \n\nfollowing introduction of Tasmar when this was accompanied by a significant reduction in other \n\nconcomitant dopaminergic medications. In addition, rhabdomyolysis, secondary to NMS or severe \n\ndyskinesia, has been observed.  \n\n \n\nUrine discolouration: Tolcapone and its metabolites are yellow and can cause a harmless \n\nintensification in the colour of the patient’s urine. \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \n\nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Tasmar in association with Levedopa (see \n\nsection 4.4 `special warnings and precautions for use´). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via \n\n \n\nthe national reporting system listed in Appendix V*. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of either accidental or intentional overdose with tolcapone tablets have been reported. \n\nHowever clinical circumstances of these cases were so diverse, that no general conclusions can be \n\ndrawn from the cases. \n\n \n\nThe highest dose of tolcapone administered to humans was 800 mg three times daily, with and without \n\nlevodopa coadministration, in a one week study in healthy elderly volunteers. The peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of tolcapone at this dose were on average 30 µg/ml (compared to 3 and 6 µg/ml with \n\n100 mg tid and 200 mg tid of tolcapone respectively). Nausea, vomiting and dizziness were observed, \n\nparticularly in combination with levodopa. \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose: Hospitalisation is advised. General supportive care is indicated. Based on \n\nthe physicochemical properties of the compound, hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: NO4BX01  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nTolcapone is an orally active, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) \n\ninhibitor. Administered concomitantly with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase \n\ninhibitor (AADC-I), it leads to more stable plasma levels of levodopa by reducing metabolism of \n\nlevodopa to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD). \n\n \n\nHigh levels of plasma 3-OMD have been associated with poor response to levodopa in Parkinson’s \n\ndisease patients. Tolcapone markedly reduces the formation of 3-OMD. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nStudies in healthy volunteers have shown that tolcapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT \n\nactivity after oral administration. The inhibition is closely related to plasma tolcapone concentration. \n\nWith 200 mg tolcapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is, on average, greater \n\n\n\n10 \n\nthan 80 %. During dosing with Tasmar 200 mg three times daily, erythrocyte COMT inhibition at \n\ntrough is 30 % to 45 %, with no development of tolerance.  \n\n \n\nTransient elevation above pretreatment levels of erythrocyte COMT activity was observed after \n\nwithdrawal of tolcapone. However, a study in Parkinson’s patients confirmed that after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation there was no significant change in levodopa pharmacokinetics or in patient response to \n\nlevodopa compared to pretreatment levels. \n\n \n\nWhen Tasmar is administered together with levodopa, it increases the relative bioavailability (AUC) \n\nof levodopa approximately twofold. This is due to a decrease in clearance in L-dopa resulting in a \n\nprolongation of the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa. In general, the average peak \n\nlevodopa plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time of its occurrence (tmax) were unaffected. The onset \n\nof effect occurs after the first administration. Studies in healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients \n\nhave confirmed that the maximum effect occurs with 100 – 200 mg tolcapone. Plasma levels of 3-\n\nOMD were markedly and dose-dependently decreased by tolcapone when given with \n\nlevodopa/AADC-I (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase - inhibitor) (benserazide or carbidopa). \n\n \n\nTolcapone’s effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics is similar with all pharmaceutical formulations of \n\nlevodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa; it is independent of levodopa dose, levodopa/AADC-I \n\n(benserazide or carbidopa) ratio and the use of sustained-release formulations. \n\n \n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety \n\nDouble blind placebo controlled clinical studies have shown a significant reduction of approximately \n\n20 % to 30 % in OFF time and a similar increase in ON time, accompanied by reduced severity of \n\nsymptoms in fluctuating patients receiving Tasmar. Investigator’s global assessments of efficacy also \n\nshowed significant improvement. \n\n \n\nA double-blind trial compared Tasmar with entacapone in Parkinson's disease patients who had at least \n\nthree hours of OFF time per day while receiving optimised levodopa therapy. The primary outcome \n\nwas the proportion of patients with a 1 or more hour increase in ON time (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nTab. 1 Primary and Secondary Outcome of double-blind Trial \n\n Entacapone \n\nN=75 \n\nTolcapon\n\ne N=75 \n\np value 95 % CI \n\nPrimary Outcome     \n\nNumber (proportion) with ≥1 hour ON time response 32 (43 %) 40 (53 %) p=0.191 -5.2;26.6 \n\nSecondary Outcome     \n\nNumber (proportion) with moderate or marked \n\nimprovement \n\n19 (25 %) 29 (39 %) p=0.080 -1.4;28.1 \n\n     \n\nNumber (proportion) improved on both primary and \n\nsecondary outcome \n\n13 (17 %) 24 (32 %) NA NA \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nIn the therapeutic range, tolcapone pharmacokinetics are linear and independent of levodopa/AADC-I \n\n(benserazide or carbidopa) coadministration. \n\n \n\nAbsorption: Tolcapone is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 2 hours. The absolute \n\nbioavailability of an oral administration is around 65 %. Tolcapone does not accumulate with three \n\ntimes daily dosing of 100 or 200 mg. At these doses, Cmax is approximately 3 and 6 µg/ml, \n\nrespectively. Food delays and decreases the absorption of tolcapone, but the relative bioavailability of \n\na dose of tolcapone taken with a meal is still 80 % to 90 %. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The volume of distribution (Vss) of tolcapone is small (9 l). Tolcapone does not distribute \n\nwidely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding (>99.9 %). In vitro experiments have shown \n\nthat tolcapone binds mainly to serum albumin. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nBiotransformation/Elimination: Tolcapone is almost completely metabolised prior to excretion, with \n\nonly a very small amount (0.5 % of dose) found unchanged in urine. The main metabolic pathway of \n\ntolcapone is conjugation to its inactive glucuronide. In addition, the compound is methylated by \n\nCOMT to 3-O-methyl-tolcapone and metabolised by cytochromes P450 3A4 and P450 2A6 to a \n\nprimary alcohol (hydroxylation of the methyl group), which is subsequently oxidised to the carboxylic \n\nacid. The reduction to a putative amine, as well as the subsequent N-acetylation, occurs to a minor \n\nextent. After oral administration, 60 % of drug-related material is excreted into urine and 40 % into \n\nfaeces. \n\n \n\nTolcapone is a low-extraction-ratio drug (extraction ratio = 0.15), with a moderate systemic clearance \n\nof about 7 L/h. The t1/2 of tolcapone is approximately 2 hours. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment: Because of the risk of liver injury observed during post-marketing use, Tasmar is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. A study in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment has shown that moderate non-cirrhotic liver disease had no impact on the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolcapone. However, in patients with moderate cirrhotic liver disease, clearance \n\nof unbound tolcapone was reduced by almost 50 %. This reduction may increase the average \n\nconcentration of unbound drug two-fold. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment: The pharmacokinetics of tolcapone have not been investigated in patients with \n\nrenal impairment. However, the relationship of renal function and tolcapone pharmacokinetics has \n\nbeen investigated using population pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. The data of more than 400 \n\npatients have confirmed that over a wide range of creatinine clearance values (30-130 mL/min) the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolcapone are unaffected by renal function. This could be explained by the fact \n\nthat only a negligible amount of unchanged tolcapone is excreted in the urine, and the main \n\nmetabolite, tolcapone-glucuronide, is excreted both in urine and in bile (faeces). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis: 3 % and 5 % of rats in the mid- and high- dose groups, respectively, of \n\nthe 24-month carcinogenicity study were shown to have renal epithelial tumours (adenomas or \n\ncarcinomas). However, no evidence of renal toxicity was observed in the low-dose group. An \n\nincreased incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas was seen in the high-dose group of the rat \n\ncarcinogenicity study. There were no similar renal findings in the mouse or dogs carcinogenicity \n\nstudies.  \n\nMutagenesis: Tolcapone was shown not to be genotoxic in a complete series of mutagenicity studies. \n\n \n\nToxicity to reproduction: Tolcapone, when administered alone, was shown to be neither teratogenic \n\nnor to have any relevant effects on fertility. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTasmar 200 mg film coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg tolcapone. \n\nExcipients with known effect: Each tablet contains 15 mg lactose  \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\n Film-coated tablet. \n\nOrange yellow to brown yellow, hexagonal, biconvex, film-coated tablet. “TASMAR” and “200” are \n\nengraved on one side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTasmar is indicated in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in \n\npatients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to \n\nrespond to or are intolerant of other catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (see section 5.1). \n\nBecause of the risk of potentially fatal, acute liver injury, Tasmar should not be considered as a first-\n\nline adjunct therapy to levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\nSince Tasmar should be used only in combination with levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa, \n\nthe prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is also applicable to their concomitant use \n\nwith Tasmar. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety \n\nor efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) \n\nTasmar is contraindicated for patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes.  \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairement (see section 5.2) \n\nNo dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment \n\n(creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min or greater). Patients with severe renal impairement (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone \n\nin these populations is available (see section 5.2) \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe administration of Tasmar is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced \n\nin the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. \n\n \n\nTasmar is administered orally three times daily. \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTasmar may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\nTasmar tablets are film-coated and should be swallowed whole because tolcapone has a bitter taste. \n\n \n\nTasmar can be combined with all pharmaceutical formulations of levodopa/benserazide and \n\nlevodopa/carbidopa (see also section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe first dose of the day of Tasmar should be taken together the first dose of the day of a levodopa \n\npreparation, and the subsequent doses should be given approximately 6 and 12 hours later. Tasmar \n\nmay be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\nThe recommended dose of Tasmar is 100 mg three times daily, always as an adjunct to \n\nlevodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Only in exceptional circumstances, when the \n\nanticipated incremental clinical benefit justifies the increased risk of hepatic reactions, should the dose \n\nbe increased to 200 mg three times daily. (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If substantial clinical benefits are \n\nnot seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment (regardless of dose) Tasmar should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\nThe maximum therapeutic dose of 200 mg three times daily should not be exceeded, as there is no \n\nevidence of additional efficacy at higher doses. \n\n \n\nLiver function should be checked before starting treatment with Tasmar and then monitored every 2 \n\nweeks for the first year of therapy, every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. \n\nIf the dose is increased to 200 mg tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the \n\ndose and then be reinitiated following the same sequence of frequencies as above (see sections 4.4 and \n\n4.8). \n\n \n\nTasmar treatment should also be discontinued if ALT (alanine amino transferase) and/or AST \n\n(aspartate amino transferase) exceed the upper limit of normal or symptoms or signs suggest the onset \n\nof hepatic failure (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLevodopa adjustments during Tasmar treatment:  \n\nAs Tasmar decreases the breakdown of levodopa in the body, side effects due to increased levodopa \n\nconcentrations may occur when beginning Tasmar treatment. In clinical trials, more than 70 % of \n\npatients required a decrease in their daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa was >600 mg \n\nor if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment. \n\nThe average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 30 % in those patients requiring a levodopa \n\ndose reduction. When beginning Tasmar, all patients should be informed of the symptoms of excessive \n\nlevodopa dose and what to do if it occurs. \n\nLevodopa adjustments when Tasmar is discontinued:  \n\nThe following suggestions are based on pharmacological considerations and have not been evaluated \n\nin clinical trials. Levodopa dose should not be decreased when Tasmar therapy is being discontinued \n\ndue to side effects related to too much levodopa. However, when Tasmar therapy is being \n\ndiscontinued for reasons other than too much levodopa, levodopa dose may have to be increased to \n\nlevels equal to or greater than before initiation of Tasmar therapy, especially if the patient had large \n\ndecreases in levodopa when starting Tasmar. In all cases, patients should be educated on the \n\nsymptoms of levodopa under-dose and what to do if it occurs. Adjustments in levodopa are most likely \n\nto be required within 1-2 days of Tasmar discontinuation. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to tolcapone or any of its other ingredients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n• Evidence of liver disease or increased liver enzymes \n\n• Severe dyskinesia \n\n•   A previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex  and /or  \n\n            non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis or Hyperthermia. \n\n•           Phaeochromocytoma. \n\n•  Treatment with non-selective mono amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors \n\n\n\n16 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTasmar therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of advanced \n\nParkinson’s disease, to ensure an appropriate risk-benefit assessment. Tasmar should not be prescribed \n\nuntil there has been a complete informative discussion of the risks with the patient. \n\n \n\nTasmar should be discontinued if substantial clinical benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the \n\ninitiation of the treatment regardless of dose. \n\n \n\nLiver injury: \n\nBecause of the risk of rare but potentially fatal acute liver injury, Tasmar is only indicated for use in \n\npatients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to \n\nrespond to or are intolerant of other COMT inhibitors. Periodic monitoring of liver enzymes cannot \n\nreliably predict the occurrence of fulminant hepatitis. However, it is generally believed that early \n\ndetection of medicine-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect \n\nmedication enhances the likelihood for recovery. Liver injury has most often occurred between 1 \n\nmonth and 6 months after starting treatment with Tasmar. Additionally late onset hepatitis after \n\napproximately 18 months of treatment has been reported rarely. \n\nIt should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver injury (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nBefore starting treatment: If liver function tests are abnormal or there are signs of impaired liver \n\nfunction, Tasmar should not be prescribed. If Tasmar is to be prescribed, the patient should be \n\ninformed about the signs and symptoms which may indicate liver injury, and to contact the physician \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\nDuring treatment: Liver function should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first year of therapy, \n\nevery 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. If the dose is increased to 200 mg \n\ntid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be re-initiated \n\nfollowing the sequence of frequencies as above. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if \n\nALT and/or AST exceed the upper limit of normal or if symptoms or signs suggesting the onset of \n\nhepatic failure (persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper \n\nquadrant tenderness) develop. \n\n \n\nIf treatment is discontinued: Patients who show evidence of acute liver injury while on Tasmar and are \n\nwithdrawn from the medicinal product may be at increased risk for liver injury if Tasmar is re-\n\nintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment. \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): \n\nIn Parkinson`s patients, NMS tends to occur when discontinuing or stopping dopaminergic-enhancing \n\nmedications. Therefore, if symptoms occur after discontinuing Tasmar, physicians should consider \n\nincreasing the patient’s levodopa dose (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIsolated cases consistent with NMS have been associated with Tasmar treatment. Symptoms have \n\nusually onset during Tasmar treatment or shortly after Tasmar has been discontinued. NMS is \n\ncharacterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus and tremor), mental status changes (agitation, \n\nconfusion, stupor and coma), elevated temperature, autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, \n\ntachycardia) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) which may be a consequence of \n\nmyolysis. A diagnosis of NMS should be considered even if not all the above findings are present. \n\nUnder such a diagnosis Tasmar should be immediately discontinued and the patient should be \n\nfollowed up closely.  \n\n \n\nBefore starting treatment: To reduce the risk of NMS, Tasmar should not be prescribed for patients \n\nwith severe dyskinesia or a previous history of NMS including rhabdomyolysis or hyperthermia (see \n\nsection 4.3). Patients receiving multiple medications with effects on different central nervous system \n\n(CNS) pathways (e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticholinergics) may be at greater risk of \n\ndeveloping NMS.  \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nImpulse control disorders: Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse \n\ncontrol disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse \n\ncontrol disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \n\nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Tasmar in association with levodopa. Review \n\nof treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop. \n\n \n\nDyskinesia, nausea and other levodopa-associated adverse reactions: Patients may experience an \n\nincrease in levodopa-associated adverse reactions. Reducing the dose of levodopa (see section 4.2) \n\nmay often mitigate these adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: In clinical trials, diarrhoea developed in 16 % and 18 % of patients receiving Tasmar \n\n100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, compared to 8 % of patients receiving placebo. Diarrhoea \n\nassociated with Tasmar usually began 2 to 4 months after initiation of therapy. Diarrhoea led to \n\nwithdrawal of 5% and 6% of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, \n\ncompared to 1 % of patients receiving placebo. \n\n \n\nBenserazide interaction: Due to the interaction between high dose benserazide and tolcapone (resulting \n\nin increased levels of benserazide), the prescriber should, until more experience has been gained, be \n\nobservant of dose-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMAO inhibitors: Tasmar should not be given in conjunction with non-selective monoamine oxidase \n\n(MAO) inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine and tranylcypromine). The combination of MAO-A and MAO-B \n\ninhibitors is equivalent to non-selective MAO-inhibition, therefore they should not both be given \n\nconcomitantly with Tasmar and levodopa preparations (see also section 4.5). Selective MAO-B \n\ninhibitors should not be used at higher than recommended doses (e.g. selegiline 10 mg/day) when co-\n\nadministered with Tasmar.  \n\n \n\nWarfarin: Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, \n\ncoagulation parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations: Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) should \n\nbe treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone in these populations is \n\navailable (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLactose intolerance: Tasmar contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \n\nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nTasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-adminstered levodopa. \n\nThe consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic adverse reactions \n\nobserved after treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, \n\nnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, \n\nsomnolence, hallucination. \n\n \n\nLevodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \n\nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very \n\nrarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating \n\nmachines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an \n\nepisode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a \n\nreduction of levodopa dose or termination of therapy may be considered (see section 4.7).  \n\n \n\nCatechols and other drugs metabolised by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT): Tolcapone may \n\ninfluence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolised by COMT. No effects were seen on the \n\npharmacokinetics of the COMT substrate carbidopa. An interaction was observed with benserazide, \n\nwhich may lead to increased levels of benserazide and its active metabolite. The magnitude of the \n\n\n\n18 \n\neffect was dependent on the dose of benserazide. The plasma concentrations of benserazide observed \n\nafter co-administration of tolcapone and benserazide-25 mg/levodopa were still within the range of \n\nvalues observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. On the other hand, after co-administration of \n\ntolcapone and benserazide-50 mg/levodopa the benserazide plasma concentrations could be increased \n\nabove the levels usually observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. The effect of tolcapone on the \n\npharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolised by COMT such as -methyldopa, dobutamine, \napomorphine, adrenaline and isoprenaline have not been evaluated. The prescriber should be observant \n\nof adverse reactions caused by putative increased plasma levels of these drugs when combined with \n\nTasmar. \n\n \n\nEffect of tolcapone on the metabolism of other drugs: Due to its affinity for cytochrome CYP2C9 in \n\nvitro, tolcapone may interfere with drugs whose clearance is dependent on this metabolic pathway, \n\nsuch as tolbutamide and warfarin. In an interaction study, tolcapone did not change the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions involving cytochrome \n\nCYP2C9 appear unlikely. \n\n \n\nSince clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation \n\nparameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. \n\n \n\nDrugs that increase catecholamines: Since tolcapone interferes with the metabolism of catecholamines, \n\ninteractions with other drugs affecting catecholamine levels are theoretically possible. \n\n \n\nWhen Tasmar was given together with levodopa/carbidopa and desipramine, there was no significant \n\nchange in blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma concentrations of desipramine. Overall, the frequency \n\nof adverse reactions increased slightly. These adverse reactions were predictable based on the known \n\nadverse reactions to each of the three drugs individually. Therefore, caution should be exercised when \n\npotent noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline, or venlafaxine are \n\nadministered to Parkinson’s disease patients being treated with Tasmar and levodopa preparations. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, patients receiving Tasmar/levodopa preparations reported a similar adverse reaction \n\nprofile independent of whether or not they were also concomitantly administered selegiline (a MAO-B \n\ninhibitor). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of tolcapone in pregnant women. Therefore, Tasmar should \n\nbe used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIn animal studies, tolcapone was excreted into maternal milk. \n\n \n\nThe safety of tolcapone in infants is unknown; therefore, women should not breast-feed during \n\ntreatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIn rats and rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity was observed after tolcapone administration (see section \n\n5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects of Tasmar on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\nThere is no evidence from clinical studies that Tasmar adversely influences a patient’s ability to drive \n\nand use machines. However patients should be advised that their ability to drive and operate machines \n\nmay be compromised due to their Parkinson’s disease symptoms.  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nTasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-adminstered levodopa. \n\nThe consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects \n\nobserved after treatment with COMT inhibitors. Patients being treated with Levodopa and presenting \n\nwith somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging \n\nin activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death \n\n(e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section \n\n4.4)  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Tasmar, occurring more \n\nfrequently than in placebo-treated patients are listed in the table below. However, Tasmar, as a COMT \n\ninhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered levodopa. The consequent \n\nincrease in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects observed after \n\ntreatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, nausea, \n\nvomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, somnolence, \n\nhallucination. \n\n \n\nThe only adverse reaction commonly leading to discontinuation of Tasmar in clinical trials was \n\ndiarrhoea (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nVery common (≥1/10) \n\nCommon (≥1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nRare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) \n\nVery rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \n\nExperience with Tasmar obtained in parallel placebo-controlled randomised studies in patients with \n\nParkinson’s disease is shown in the following table, which lists adverse reactions with a potential \n\nrelationship to Tasmar. \n\nSummary of potentially Tasmar-related adverse reactions, with crude incidence rates for the phase III \n\nplacebo-controlled studies: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nIncidence \n\n \n\nAdverse Events \n\nInfections and infestations Common Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nPsychiatric disorders Very common Sleep disorder \n\n  Dreaming excessive \n\n  Somnolence \n\n  Confusion \n\n  Hallucination \n\n Rare Impulse control disorders* \n\n(Libido increased, hypersexuality, \n\npathological gambling, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating, \n\ncompulsive eating (see section 4.4)) \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Dyskinesia \n\n  Dystonia \n\n  Headache \n\n  Dizziness \n\n  Somnolence \n\n  Orthostatic complaints \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\n \n\nIncidence \n\n \n\nAdverse Events \n\n Rare Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \n\nSymptom Complex (see section 4.4) \n\n Common Hypokinesia \n\n  Syncope \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea \n\n   \n\n  Diarrhoea \n\n Common Vomiting \n\n  Constipation \n\n  Xerostomia \n\n  Abdominal pain \n\n  Dyspepsia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common Anorexia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Sweating increased \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Urine discoloration \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Chest pain \n\n  Influenza like illness \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Hepatocellular injury, in rare cases \n\nwith fatal outcome* (see section 4.4) \n\nInvestigations Common Increase of alanine aminotransferase \n\n(ALT) \n\n*: Adverse reactions for which no frequency could be derived from clinical studies (i.e. where a \n\nspecific adverse reaction was not observed in clinical trials but was reported post-marketing only) \n\nare indicated by an asterisk (*), and the frequency category has been calculated according to EU \n\nGuideline. \n \n\nIncrease of alanine aminotransferase \n\nIncreases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \n\noccurred in 1 % of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg three times daily, and 3 % of patients at 200 mg \n\nthree times daily. Increases were approximately two times more likely in females. The increases \n\nusually appeared within 6 to 12 weeks of starting treatment, and were not associated with any clinical \n\nsigns or symptoms. In about half the cases, transaminase levels returned spontaneously to baseline \n\nvalues whilst patients continued Tasmar treatment. For the remainder, when treatment was \n\ndiscontinued, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels. \n\n \n\nHepatocellular injury \n\nRare cases of severe hepatocellular injury resulting in death have been reported during marketed use \n\n(see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex  \n\nIsolated cases of patients with symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom \n\nComplex (see sectiom 4.4) have been reported following reduction or discontinuation of Tasmar and \n\nfollowing introduction of Tasmar when this was accompanied by a significant reduction in other \n\nconcomitant dopaminergic medications. In addition, rhabdomyolysis, secondary to NMS or severe \n\ndyskinesia, has been observed.  \n\n \n\nUrine discolouration: Tolcapone and its metabolites are yellow and can cause a harmless \n\nintensification in the colour of the patient’s urine. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \n\nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Tasmar in association with Levedopa (see \n\nsection 4.4 `special warnings and precautions for use´). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via \n\n \n\nthe national reporting system listed in Appendix V*. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of either accidental or intentional overdose with tolcapone tablets have been reported. \n\nHowever clinical circumstances of these cases were so diverse, that no general conclusions can be \n\ndrawn from the cases. \n\n \n\nThe highest dose of tolcapone administered to humans was 800 mg three times daily, with and without \n\nlevodopa coadministration, in a one week study in healthy elderly volunteers. The peak plasma \n\nconcentrations of tolcapone at this dose were on average 30 µg/ml (compared to 3 and 6 µg/ml with \n\n100 mg tid and 200 mg tid of tolcapone respectively). Nausea, vomiting and dizziness were observed, \n\nparticularly in combination with levodopa. \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose: Hospitalisation is advised. General supportive care is indicated. Based on \n\nthe physicochemical properties of the compound, hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: NO4BX01  \n\n \n\nMecahnism of action \n\nTolcapone is an orally active, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) \n\ninhibitor. Administered concomitantly with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase \n\ninhibitor (AADC-I), it leads to more stable plasma levels of levodopa by reducing metabolism of \n\nlevodopa to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD). \n\n \n\nHigh levels of plasma 3-OMD have been associated with poor response to levodopa in Parkinson’s \n\ndisease patients. Tolcapone markedly reduces the formation of 3-OMD. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nStudies in healthy volunteers have shown that tolcapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT \n\nactivity after oral administration. The inhibition is closely related to plasma tolcapone concentration. \n\nWith 200 mg tolcapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is, on average, greater \n\nthan 80 %. During dosing with Tasmar 200 mg three times daily, erythrocyte COMT inhibition at \n\ntrough is 30 % to 45 %, with no development of tolerance.  \n\n \n\nTransient elevation above pretreatment levels of erythrocyte COMT activity was observed after \n\nwithdrawal of tolcapone. However, a study in Parkinson’s patients confirmed that after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation there was no significant change in levodopa pharmacokinetics or in patient response to \n\nlevodopa compared to pretreatment levels. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nWhen Tasmar is administered together with levodopa, it increases the relative bioavailability (AUC) \n\nof levodopa approximately twofold. This is due to a decrease in clearance in L-dopa resulting in a \n\nprolongation of the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa. In general, the average peak \n\nlevodopa plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time of its occurrence (tmax) were unaffected. The onset \n\nof effect occurs after the first administration. Studies in healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients \n\nhave confirmed that the maximum effect occurs with 100 – 200 mg tolcapone. Plasma levels of 3-\n\nOMD were markedly and dose-dependently decreased by tolcapone when given with \n\nlevodopa/AADC-I (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase - inhibitor) (benserazide or carbidopa). \n\n \n\nTolcapone’s effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics is similar with all pharmaceutical formulations of \n\nlevodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa; it is independent of levodopa dose, levodopa/AADC-I \n\n(benserazide or carbidopa) ratio and the use of sustained-release formulations. \n\n \n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety \n\nDouble blind placebo controlled clinical studies have shown a significant reduction of approximately \n\n20 % to 30 % in OFF time and a similar increase in ON time, accompanied by reduced severity of \n\nsymptoms in fluctuating patients receiving Tasmar. Investigator’s global assessments of efficacy also \n\nshowed significant improvement. \n\n \n\nA double-blind trial compared Tasmar with entacapone in Parkinson's disease patients who had at least \n\nthree hours of OFF time per day while receiving optimised levodopa therapy. The primary outcome \n\nwas the proportion of patients with a 1 or more hour increase in ON time (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nTab. 1 Primary and Secondary Outcome of double-blind Trial \n\n Entacapone \n\nN=75 \n\nTolcapon\n\ne N=75 \n\np value 95 % CI \n\nPrimary Outcome     \n\nNumber (proportion) with ≥1 hour ON time response 32 (43 %) 40 (53 %) p=0.191 -5.2;26.6 \n\nSecondary Outcome     \n\nNumber (proportion) with moderate or marked \n\nimprovement \n\n19 (25 %) 29 (39 %) p=0.080 -1.4;28.1 \n\n     \n\nNumber (proportion) improved on both primary and \n\nsecondary outcome \n\n13 (17 %) 24 (32 %) NA NA \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nIn the therapeutic range, tolcapone pharmacokinetics are linear and independent of levodopa/AADC-I \n\n(benserazide or carbidopa) coadministration. \n\n \n\nAbsorption: Tolcapone is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 2 hours. The absolute \n\nbioavailability of an oral administration is around 65 %. Tolcapone does not accumulate with three \n\ntimes daily dosing of 100 or 200 mg. At these doses, Cmax is approximately 3 and 6 µg/ml, \n\nrespectively. Food delays and decreases the absorption of tolcapone, but the relative bioavailability of \n\na dose of tolcapone taken with a meal is still 80 % to 90 %. \n\n \n\nDistribution: The volume of distribution (Vss) of tolcapone is small (9 l). Tolcapone does not distribute \n\nwidely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding (>99.9 %). In vitro experiments have shown \n\nthat tolcapone binds mainly to serum albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation/Elimination: Tolcapone is almost completely metabolised prior to excretion, with \n\nonly a very small amount (0.5 % of dose) found unchanged in urine. The main metabolic pathway of \n\ntolcapone is conjugation to its inactive glucuronide. In addition, the compound is methylated by \n\nCOMT to 3-O-methyl-tolcapone and metabolised by cytochromes P450 3A4 and P450 2A6 to a \n\nprimary alcohol (hydroxylation of the methyl group), which is subsequently oxidised to the carboxylic \n\nacid. The reduction to a putative amine, as well as the subsequent N-acetylation, occurs to a minor \n\n\n\n23 \n\nextent. After oral administration, 60 % of drug-related material is excreted into urine and 40 % into \n\nfaeces. \n\n \n\nTolcapone is a low-extraction-ratio drug (extraction ratio = 0.15), with a moderate systemic clearance \n\nof about 7 L/h. The t1/2 of tolcapone is approximately 2 hours. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment: Because of the risk of liver injury observed during post-marketing use, Tasmar is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. A study in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment has shown that moderate non-cirrhotic liver disease had no impact on the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolcapone. However, in patients with moderate cirrhotic liver disease, clearance \n\nof unbound tolcapone was reduced by almost 50 %. This reduction may increase the average \n\nconcentration of unbound drug two-fold. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment: The pharmacokinetics of tolcapone have not been investigated in patients with \n\nrenal impairment. However, the relationship of renal function and tolcapone pharmacokinetics has \n\nbeen investigated using population pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. The data of more than 400 \n\npatients have confirmed that over a wide range of creatinine clearance values (30-130 mL/min) the \n\npharmacokinetics of tolcapone are unaffected by renal function. This could be explained by the fact \n\nthat only a negligible amount of unchanged tolcapone is excreted in the urine, and the main \n\nmetabolite, tolcapone-glucuronide, is excreted both in urine and in bile (faeces). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis: 3 % and 5 % of rats in the mid- and high- dose groups, respectively, of \n\nthe 24-month carcinogenicity study were shown to have renal epithelial tumours (adenomas or \n\ncarcinomas). However, no evidence of renal toxicity was observed in the low-dose group. An \n\nincreased incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas was seen in the high-dose group of the rat \n\ncarcinogenicity study. There were no similar renal findings in the mouse or dogs carcinogenicity \n\nstudies.  \n\nMutagenesis: Tolcapone was shown not to be genotoxic in a complete series of mutagenicity studies. \n\n \n\nToxicity to reproduction: Tolcapone, when administered alone, was shown to be neither teratogenic \n\nnor to have any relevant effects on fertility. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n40 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nTasmar 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\nTolcapone \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n\n-   This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even   \n\n             if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n-   If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\n            effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Tasmar is and what it is used for \n\n2. What do you need to know before you take Tasmar \n\n3. How to take Tasmar \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Tasmar \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tasmar is and what it is used for \n\nFor the treatment of Parkinson´s disease, Tasmar is used together with the medicinal product levodopa \n\n(as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa). \n\nTasmar is used when all other alternative medicines cannot stabilise your Parkinson’s disease.  \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of your Parkinson´s disease you already take levodopa. \n\nA natural protein (enzyme) in your body, the (COMT) Catechol-O-methyltransferase breaks down the \n\nlevodopa. . Tasmar blocks this enzyme and thus slows the breakdown of levodopa. This means when it \n\nis taken together with levodopa (as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa) you should have an \n\nimprovement in the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tasmar \n\nDo not take Tasmar: \n\n- if you have liver disease or increased liver enzymes \n\n- if you have severe involuntary movement (dyskinesia) \n\n-   if you have a previous history of severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental   \n\n            confusion (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex ) and /or if you have \n\n damage of skeletal muscle tissue (non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis) or fever (Hyperthermia). \n\n-  if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance tolcapone or to any of the other \n\n ingredients of Tasmar. \n\n-  if you have a special type of tumor in the adrenal medulla (Phaeochromocytoma) \n\n-  if you take a certain medication to treat depression and anxiety, called  non-selective mono \n\namino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasmar.  \n\nYou should not start taking Tasmar until your doctor \n\n- has described the risks of treatment with Tasmar, \n\n- has explained the measures necessary to minimise those risks, \n\n- has answered any questions you may have. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n- if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits \n\nof taking Tasmar during pregnancy. The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You \n\nshould not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/ carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in \n\nways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain \n\nactivities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and \n\ncan include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a \n\npreoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your \n\ntreatments. \n\n \n\nYou should only receive Tasmar if your Parkinson’s disease is not adequately controlled by the use of  \n\nother therapies. \n\n \n\nIn addition, your doctor will stop Tasmar treatment if after 3 weeks you do not improve enough to \n\njustify the risks of continuing treatment. \n\n \n\nLiver Injury: \n\nTasmar may cause rare but potentially fatal liver injury. Liver injury has occurred most often after 1 \n\nmonth and before 6 months. It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver \n\ninjury. Therefore, the following preventive measures have to be considered. \n\n \n\nBefore beginning treatment:  \n\nTo reduce the risk of liver injury you should not use Tasmar if  \n\n- you have a liver disease  \n- in case of elevated liver function tests in the blood test done before starting treatment (tests of  \n\n  alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)).  \n\n \n\nWhile receiving treatment: \n\nDuring treatment, blood tests will be done in the following time intervals: \n\n- every 2 weeks during the first 12 months of therapy, \n- every 4 weeks during the following 6 months of therapy, \n- every 8 weeks during further treatment. \nThe treatment will be stopped, if these blood tests become abnormal.  \n\n \n\nThe treatment with Tasmar may sometimes lead to disturbances in the way the liver works. Therefore, \n\nyou should contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, \n\npain in your stomach (particulary over the liver in the right upper area), loss of appetite, weakness, \n\nfever, darkening of urine, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) or if you tire more easily. \n\nIf you have been already treated with Tasmar and developed acute liver injury during treatment, \n\nTasmar should not be re-introduced again. \n\n \n\nNMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome):  \n\nSymptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur during Tasmar treatment. \n\nThe NMS consists of some or all of the following: \n\n- severe muscle stiffness, jerking movements of muscles, arms or legs, and soreness of muscles. \nMuscle injury can sometimes cause dark urine. \n\n- other important symptoms are high fever and mental confusion. \n \n\nRarely, after abruptly reducing or stopping Tasmar or other antiparkinsonian drugs, you may \n\nexperience severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental confusion. If this happens notify \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nThe following preventive measures have to be considered. \n\nBefore beginning treatment: \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTo reduce the risk of NMS you should not use Tasmar if your doctor says you have severe involuntary \n\nmovement (dyskinesia) or a previous illness that may have been NMS. \n\nInform your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medications as the risk of NMS may be \n\nincreased if you are taking some specific medications. \n\n \n\nWhile receiving treatment: \n\nIf you develop any symptoms as described above, that you think may be NMS, you should report them \n\nto your doctor immediately.  \n\nDo not stop Tasmar or any other Parkinson’s medications without telling your doctor as this may \n\nincrease the risk of NMS. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor also: \n\n- if you have any illnesses other than Parkinson’s disease, \n\n- if you are allergic to other medicines, food and dyes, \n\n- if soon after beginning and during treatment with Tasmar you have symptoms which may be \n\ncaused by levodopa such as involuntary movement (dyskinesia) and nausea. \n\n \n\nIf you feel unwell, you should contact your doctor because you may need to take less levodopa. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety \n\nor efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther Medicines and Tasmar \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\neven those not prescribed (non-prescription medicines and herbals). \n\n \n\nPlease inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking especially:  \n\n- antidepressants, \n\n- alpha-methyldopa (used to treat increased blood pressure), \n\n- apomorphine (used for Parkinson’s disease), \n\n- dobutamine (used for the chronic heart disease), \n\n- adrenaline  and isoprenaline (both used for heart attacks), \n\n-   anticoagulants of the warfarin type (that prevent blood clotting). In this case your doctor may  \n\n             perform regular blood tests to monitor how easily your blood clots. \n\n \n\nIf you go to hospital or if you are prescribed a new medicine, you must tell your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Tasmar. \n\n \n\nTasmar with food and drink and alcohol \n\nTasmar can be taken with or without food. \n\nTasmar should be taken with 1 glass of water. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss \n\nthe risks and benefits of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You should not breast-feed your infant during \n\ntreatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSince your ability to drive a car or operate machinery may be affected by Parkinson’s disease, you \n\nshould discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\nTasmar has an effect on the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease. \n\n\n\n43 \n\nTasmar used with your other Parkinson medicines can cause excessive drowsiness (somnolence ) and \n\nsudden sleep onset episodes (you may suddenly fall asleep). Therefore you must refrain from driving \n\nor operating machines until such recurrent episodes and excessive drowsiness have resolved.  \n\n \n\nTasmar contains lactose \n\n \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tasmar \n\n \n\nAlways take Tasmar exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure.  \n\n \n\nDose and frequency of administration \n\nYour doctor should always begin your treatment with the standard dose of 3 times daily 1 tablet \n\n(100 mg (1 tablet)).  \n\nIf benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment, Tasmar should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\nTo improve efficacy your doctor should only increase the dose to 3 times daily 2 tablets (200 mg three \n\ntimes a day) if the increase in how your Parkinson´s disease symptoms are controlled outweighs the \n\nexpected increase in side effects.The side effects at the higher dose can often be severe and affect your \n\nliver. If you do not get better at the higher dose after a total of 3 weeks, your doctor should stop your \n\ntreatment with Tasmar.  \n\n \n\nWhen beginning and during treatment with Tasmar, your dose of levodopa may need to be changed. \n\nYour doctor will advise you what to do. \n\n \n\nHow to take the medication: \n\nSwallow Tasmar with 1 glass of water. \n\nDo not break or crush the tablets. \n\nThe first tablet Tasmar is to be taken in the morning together with your other parkinsonian medicine \n\n‘levodopa’. \n\nThe following doses of Tasmar should be taken 6 and 12 hours later. \n\n \n\nTime of day Dose Note \n\nMorning 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar Together with the first daily dose \n\n´levodopa’ \n\nDuring the day 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar  \n\nEvening 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar  \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tasmar than you should \n\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or hospital immediately as you may need urgent medical attention. \n\nIf another person accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital immediately as he or \n\nshe may need urgent medical attention. \n\n \n\nSymptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and breathing difficulties.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Tasmar \n\nTake it as soon as you remember, then continue to take it at the usual times. However, if taking the \n\nnext dose should be directly ahead, do not make up for the forgotten dose.. Do not take a double dose \n\nto make up for forgotten individual doses.

It may harm them, even  \n\n             if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n-   If you get any side effects talk to you doctor or pharmacist.

What Tasmar is and what it is used for \n\nFor the treatment of Parkinson´s disease, Tasmar is used together with the medicinal product levodopa \n\n(as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa). \n\nTasmar is used when all other alternative medicines cannot stabilise your Parkinson’s disease.  \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of your Parkinson´s disease you already take levodopa. \n\nA natural protein (enzyme) in your body, the (COMT) Catechol-O-methyltransferase in your body \n\nbreaks down levodopa. Tasmar blocks this enzyme and thus slows the breakdown of levodopa. This \n\nmeans when it is taken together with levodopa (as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa) you \n\nshould have an improvement in the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What do you need to know before you take Tasmar \n\nDo not take Tasmar: \n\n- if you have liver disease or increased liver enzymes \n\n- if you have severe involuntary movement (dyskinesia) \n\n-   if you have a previous history of severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental  \n\n            confusion (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex) and /or if you have  \n\n            damage of skeletal muscle tissue (non-traumatic Rhabdomyolysis)  \n\n-  if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance tolcapone or to any of the other  \n\n           ingredients of Tasmar. \n\n- if you have a special type of tumor in the adrenal medulla  \n\n(Phaeochromocytoma) \n\n- if you take a certain medication to treat depression and anxiety, called non-selective mono \n\namino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasmar. \n\nYou should not start taking Tasmar until your doctor \n\n- has described the risks of treatment with Tasmar, \n\n- has explained the measures necessary to minimise those risks, \n\n- has answered any questions you may have. \n\n\n\n50 \n\n- if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits \n\nof taking Tasmar during pregnancy. The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You \n\nshould not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/ carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in \n\nways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain \n\nactivities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and \n\ncan include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a \n\npreoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your \n\ntreatments. \n\n \n\nYou should only receive Tasmar if your Parkinson’s disease is not adequately controlled by the use of  \n\nother therapies. \n\n \n\nIn addition, your doctor will stop Tasmar treatment if after 3 weeks you do not improve enough to \n\njustify the risks of continuing treatment. \n\n \n\nLiver Injury: \n\nTasmar may cause rare but potentially fatal liver injury. Liver injury has occurred most often after 1 \n\nmonth and before 6 months. It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver \n\ninjury. Therefore, the following preventive measures have to be considered. \n\n \n\nBefore beginning treatment:  \n\nTo reduce the risk of liver injury you should not use Tasmar if  \n\n- you have a liver disease  \n- in case of elevated liver function tests in the blood test done before starting treatment (tests of  \n\n  alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)).  \n\n \n\nWhile receiving treatment: \n\nDuring treatment, blood tests will be done in the following time intervals: \n\n- every 2 weeks during the first 12 months of therapy, \n- every 4 weeks during the following 6 months of therapy, \n- every 8 weeks during further treatment. \nThe treatment will be stopped, if these blood tests become abnormal.  \n\n \n\nThe treatment with Tasmar may sometimes lead to disturbances in the way the liver works. Therefore, \n\nyou should contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, \n\npain in your stomach (particulary over the liver in the right upper area), loss of appetite, weakness, \n\nfever, darkening of urine, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) or if you tire more easily. \n\nIf you have been already treated with Tasmar and developed acute liver injury during treatment, \n\nTasmar should not be re-introduced again. \n\n \n\nNMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome):  \n\nSymptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur during Tasmar treatment. \n\nThe NMS consists of some or all of the following: \n\n- severe muscle stiffness, jerking movements of muscles, arms or legs, and soreness of muscles. \n  Muscle injury can sometimes cause dark urine. \n\n- other important symptoms are high fever and mental confusion. \n \n\nRarely, after abruptly reducing or stopping Tasmar or other antiparkinsonian drugs, you may \n\nexperience severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental confusion. If this happens notify \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nThe following preventive measures have to be considered. \n\n \n\nBefore beginning treatment: \n\n\n\n51 \n\nTo reduce the risk of NMS you should not use Tasmar if your doctor says you have severe involuntary \n\nmovement (dyskinesia) or a previous illness that may have been NMS. \n\nInform your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medications as the risk of NMS may be \n\nincreased if you are taking some specific medications. \n\n \n\nWhile receiving treatment: \n\nIf you develop any symptoms as described above, that you think may be NMS, you should report them \n\nto your doctor immediately.  \n\nDo not stop Tasmar or any other Parkinson’s medications without telling your doctor as this may \n\nincrease the risk of NMS. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor also: \n\n- if you have any illnesses other than Parkinson’s disease, \n\n- if you are allergic to other medicines, food and dyes, \n\n- if soon after beginning and during treatment with Tasmar you have symptoms which may be \n\ncaused by levodopa such as involuntary movement (dyskinesia) and nausea. \n\n \n\nIf you feel unwell, you should contact your doctor because you may need to take less levodopa. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety \n\nor efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther Medicines and Tasmar \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\neven those not prescribed (non-prescription medicines and herbals). \n\n \n\nPlease inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking especially: \n\n- antidepressants, \n\n- alpha-methyldopa (used to treat increased blood pressure), \n\n- apomorphine (used for Parkinson’s disease), \n\n- dobutamine (used for the chronic heart disease), \n\n- adrenaline  and isoprenaline (both used for heart attacks) \n\n- anticoagulants of the warfarin type (that prevent blood clotting). In this case your doctor may \n\n  perform regular blood tests to monitor how easily your blood clots. \n\n \n\nIf you go to hospital or if you are prescribed a new medicine, you must tell your doctor that you are \n\ntaking Tasmar. \n\n \n\nTasmar with food and drink and alcohol \n\nTasmar can be taken with or without food. \n\nTasmar should be taken with 1 glass of water. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss \n\nthe risks and benefits of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You should not breast-feed your infant during \n\ntreatment with Tasmar. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSince your ability to drive a car or operate machinery may be affected by Parkinson’s disease, you \n\nshould discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\nTasmar has an effect on the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease. \n\n\n\n52 \n\nTasmar used with your other Parkinson medicines can cause excessive drowsiness (somnolence) and \n\nsudden sleep onset episodes (you may suddenly fall asleep). Therefore you must refrain from driving \n\nor operating machines until such recurrent episodes and excessive drowsiness have resolved.  \n\n \n\nTasmar contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Tasmar \n\n \n\nAlways take Tasmar exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure.  \n\n \n\nDose and frequency of administration \n\nYour doctor should always begin your treatment with the standard dose of 3 times daily 1 tablet \n\n(100 mg (1 tablet)). \n\nIf benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment, Tasmar should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\nTo improve efficacy, your doctor should only increase the dose to the higher dose (200 mg three times \n\na day) if the increase in how your Parkinson’s disease symptoms are controlled outweighs the \n\nexpected increase in side effects. The side effects at the higher dose can often be severe and affect \n\nyour liver, If you do not get better at the higher dose after a total of 3 weeks, your doctor should stop \n\nyour treatment with Tasmar.  \n\n \n\nWhen beginning and during treatment with Tasmar, your dose of Levodopa may need to be changed. \n\nYour doctor will advise you what to do. \n\n \n\nHow to take the medication: \n\nSwallow Tasmar with 1 glass of water. \n\nDo not break or crush the tablets. \n\nThe first tablet Tasmar is to be taken in the morning together with your other parkinsonian medicine \n\n‘levodopa’. \n\nThe following doses of Tasmar should be taken 6 and 12 hours later. \n\n \n\nTime of day Dose Note \n\nMorning 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar Together with the first daily dose \n\n‚levodopa’ \n\nDuring the day 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar  \n\nEvening 1 film-coated tablet Tasmar  \n\n \n\nIf you take more Tasmar than you should \n\nContact your doctor, pharmacist or hospital immediately as you may need urgent medical attention. \n\nIf another person accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital immediately as he or \n\nshe may need urgent medical attention. \n\n \n\nSymptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and breathing difficulties.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Tasmar \n\nTake it as soon as you remember, then continue to take it at the usual times. However, if taking the \n\nnext dose should be directly ahead, do not make up for the forgotten dose. Do not take a double dose \n\nto make up for forgotten individual doses. If you have forgotten several doses, please inform your \n\ndoctor and follow the advice given to you. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Tasmar \n\n\n\n53 \n\nDo not reduce or stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to.
