NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRILUTEK 50 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg of riluzole \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet  \nThe tablets are capsule-shaped, white and engraved with “RPR 202” on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRILUTEK is indicated to extend life or the time to mechanical ventilation for patients with \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). \n \nClinical trials have demonstrated that RILUTEK extends survival for patients with ALS (see section \n5.1). Survival was defined as patients who were alive, not intubated for mechanical ventilation and \ntracheotomy-free. \nThere is no evidence that RILUTEK exerts a therapeutic effect on motor function, lung function, \nfasciculations, muscle strength and motor symptoms. RILUTEK has not been shown to be effective in \nthe late stages of ALS. \n \nSafety and efficacy of RILUTEK has only been studied in ALS. Therefore, RILUTEK should not be \nused in patients with any other form of motor neurone disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with RILUTEK should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the \nmanagement of motor neurone diseases. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended daily dose in adults or older people is 100 mg (50 mg every 12 hours). \nNo significant increased benefit can be expected from higher daily doses. \n \nSpecial populations \nImpaired renal function \nRILUTEK is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal function, as studies at repeated \ndoses have not been conducted in this population (see section 4.4). \n \nOlder people \nBased on pharmacokinetic data, there are no special instructions for the use of RILUTEK in this \npopulation. \n \nImpaired hepatic function \nSee sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nRILUTEK is not recommended for use in paediatric population, due to a lack of data on the safety and \nefficacy of riluzole in any neurodegenerative diseases occurring in children or adolescents. \n \nMethod of administration \nOral use \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHepatic disease or baseline transaminases greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. \n \nPatients who are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLiver impairment \nRiluzole should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of abnormal liver function, or in \npatients with slightly elevated serum transaminases (ALT/SGPT; AST/SGOT up to 3 times the upper \nlimit of the normal range (ULN)), bilirubin and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. Baseline \nelevations of several liver function tests (especially elevated bilirubin) should preclude the use of \nriluzole (see section 4.8). \n \nBecause of the risk of hepatitis, serum transaminases, including ALT, should be measured before and \nduring therapy with riluzole. ALT should be measured every month during the first 3 months of \ntreatment, every 3 months during the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter. ALT \nlevels should be measured more frequently in patients who develop elevated ALT levels. \n \nRiluzole should be discontinued if the ALT levels increase to 5 times the ULN. There is no experience \nwith dose reduction or rechallenge in patients who have developed an increase of ALT to 5 times \nULN. Readministration of riluzole to patients in this situation cannot be recommended. \n \nNeutropenia \nPatients should be warned to report any febrile illness to their physicians. The report of a febrile illness \nshould prompt physicians to check white blood cell counts and to discontinue riluzole in case of \nneutropenia (see section 4.8). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported in patients treated with riluzole, some of them \nwere severe (see section 4.8). If respiratory symptoms develop such as dry cough and/or dyspnoea, \nchest radiography should be performed, and in case of findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease \n(e.g. bilateral diffuse lung opacities), riluzole should be discontinued immediately. In the majority of \nthe reported cases, symptoms resolved after medicinal product discontinuation and symptomatic \ntreatment.  \n \nRenal impairment \nStudies at repeated doses have not been conducted in patients with impaired renal function (see section \n4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no clinical studies to evaluate the interactions of riluzole with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal \nisozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole. Inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g. caffeine, \ndiclofenac, diazepam, nicergoline, clomipramine, imipramine, fluvoxamine, phenacetin, theophylline, \namitriptyline and quinolones) could potentially decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while \ninducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g. cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin and omeprazole) could \nincrease the rate of riluzole elimination. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nRILUTEK is contraindicated in pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \nClinical experience with riluzole in pregnant women is lacking. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nRILUTEK is contraindicated in breast-feeding women (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \nIt is not known whether riluzole is excreted in human milk. \n \nFertility \nFertility studies in rats revealed slight impairment of reproductive performance and fertility at doses of \n15 mg/kg/day (which is higher than the therapeutic dose), probably due to sedation and lethargy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or vertigo, and advised not to drive or \noperate machinery if these symptoms occur. \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nIn phase III clinical studies conducted in ALS patients treated with riluzole, the most commonly \nreported adverse reactions were asthenia, nausea and abnormal liver function tests. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nUndesirable effects ranked under headings of frequency are listed below, using the following \nconvention: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  Anaemia Severe \nneutropenia (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactoid \nreaction, \nangioedema \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache, \ndizziness,  \noral paraesthesia, \nsomnolence \n\n  \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n \n\n Tachycardia   \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n \n\n  Interstitial lung \ndisease (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n \n\nNausea Diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain,  \nvomiting \n\nPancreatitis  \n\nHepato-biliary \ndisorders \n\nAbnormal liver \nfunction tests \n\n  Hepatitis \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nAsthenia Pain   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHepato-biliary disorders \nIncreased alanine aminotransferase usually appeared within 3 months after the start of therapy with \nriluzole; they were usually transient and levels returned to below twice the ULN after 2 to 6 months \nwhile treatment was continued. These increases could be associated with jaundice. In patients (n=20) \nfrom clinical studies with increases in ALT to more than 5 times the ULN, treatment was discontinued \nand the levels returned to less than 2 times the ULN within 2 to 4 months in most cases (see section \n4.4). \nStudy data indicate that Asian patients may be more susceptible to liver function test abnormalities - \n3.2% (194/5995) of Asian patients and 1.8% (100/5641) of Caucasian patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNeurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor, coma, and \nmethaemoglobinaemia have been observed in isolated cases. \n \nIn case of overdose, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX02. \n \nMechanism of action \nAlthough the pathogenesis of ALS is not completely elucidated, it is suggested that glutamate (the \nprimary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system) plays a role for cell death in the \ndisease. \n \nRiluzole is proposed to act by inhibiting glutamate processes. The mode of action is unclear. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a trial, 155 patients were randomised to riluzole 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) or placebo and \nwere followed-up for 12 to 21 months. Survival, as defined in the second paragraph of section 4.1, was \nsignificantly extended for patients who received riluzole as compared to patients who received \nplacebo. The median survival time was 17.7 months versus 14.9 months for riluzole and placebo, \nrespectively. \n \nIn a dose-ranging trial, 959 patients with ALS were randomised to one of four treatment groups: \nriluzole 50, 100, 200 mg/day, or placebo and were followed-up for 18 months. In patients treated with \nriluzole 100 mg/day, survival was significantly higher compared to patients who received placebo. The \neffect of riluzole 50 mg/day was not statistically significant compared to placebo and the effect of \n200 mg/day was essentially comparable to that of 100 mg/day. The median survival time approached \n16.5 months versus 13.5 months for riluzole 100 mg/day and placebo, respectively. \n \nIn a parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients at a late stage \nof the disease, survival time and motor function under riluzole did not differ significantly from that of \nplacebo. In this study the majority of patients had a vital capacity less than 60%. \n \nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of riluzole in \nJapanese patients, 204 patients were randomised to riluzole 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) or \nplacebo and were followed-up for 18 months. In this study, the efficacy was assessed on inability to \nwalk alone, loss of upper limb function, tracheostomy, need for artificial ventilation, gastric tube \nfeeding or death. Tracheostomy-free survival in patients treated with riluzole did not differ \nsignificantly from placebo. However, the power of this study to detect differences between treatment \ngroups was low. Meta-analysis including this study and those described above showed a less striking \neffect on survival for riluzole as compared to placebo although the differences remained statistically \nsignificant. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of riluzole have been evaluated in healthy male volunteers after single oral \nadministration of 25 to 300 mg and after multiple-dose oral administration of 25 to 100 mg bid. \nPlasma levels increase linearly with the dose and the pharmacokinetic profile is dose-independent. \nWith multiple dose administration (10 day-treatment at 50 mg riluzole bid), unchanged riluzole \naccumulates in plasma by about 2 fold and steady-state is reached in less than 5 days. \n \nAbsorption \nRiluzole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximal plasma concentrations occurring \nwithin 60 to 90 minutes (Cmax=173 ± 72 (sd) ng/ml). About 90% of the dose is absorbed and the \nabsolute bioavailability is 60 ± 18%. \n \nThe rate and extent of absorption is reduced when riluzole is administered with high-fat meals \n(decrease in Cmax of 44%, decrease in AUC of 17%). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nDistribution \nRiluzole is extensively distributed throughout the body and has been shown to cross the blood brain \nbarrier. The volume of distribution of riluzole is about 245 ± 69 L (3.4 L/kg). Riluzole is about 97% \nprotein bound and it binds mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. \n \nBiotransformation \nUnchanged riluzole is the main component in plasma and is extensively metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 and subsequent glucuronidation. In vitro studies using human liver preparations demonstrated \nthat cytochrome P450 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of riluzole. The \nmetabolites identified in urine are three phenolic derivatives, one ureido-derivative and unchanged \nriluzole. \n \nThe primary metabolic pathway for riluzole is initial oxidation by cytochrome P450 1A2 producing \nN-hydroxy-riluzole (RPR112512), the major active metabolite of riluzole. This metabolite is rapidly \nglucuronoconjugated to O- and N-glucuronides. \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life ranges from 9 to 15 hours. Riluzole is eliminated mainly in the urine. \nThe overall urinary excretion accounts for about 90% of the dose. Glucuronides accounted for more \nthan 85% of the metabolites in the urine. Only 2% of a riluzole dose was recovered unchanged in the \nurine. \n \nSpecial populations \nImpaired renal function \nThere is no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between patients with moderate or \nsevere chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance between 10 and 50 ml.min-1) and healthy \nvolunteers after a single oral dose of 50 mg riluzole. \n \nOlder people \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of riluzole after multiple dose administration (4.5 days of treatment \nat 50 mg riluzole bid) are not affected in the older people (>70 years). \n \nImpaired hepatic function \nThe AUC of riluzole after a single oral dose of 50 mg increases by about 1.7 fold in patients with mild \nchronic liver insufficiency and by about 3 fold in patients with moderate chronic liver insufficiency. \n \nRace \nA clinical study conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of riluzole and its metabolite \nN-hydroxyriluzole following repeated oral administration twice daily for 8 days in 16 healthy Japanese \nand 16 Caucasian adult males showed in the Japanese group a lower exposure of riluzole (Cmax 0.85 \n[90% CI 0.68-1.08] and AUC inf.  0.88 [90% CI 0.69-1.13]) and similar exposure to the metabolite. The \nclinical significance of these results is not known. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRiluzole did not show any carcinogenicity potential in either rats or mice. \n \nStandard tests for genotoxicity performed with riluzole were negative. Tests on the major active \nmetabolite of riluzole gave positive results in two in vitro tests. Intensive testing in seven other \nstandard in vitro or in vivo assays did not show any genotoxic potential of the metabolite. On the basis \nof these data, and taking into consideration the negative studies on the carcinogenesis of riluzole in the \nmouse and rat, the genotoxic effect of this metabolite is not considered to be of relevance in humans. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nReductions in red blood cell parameters and/or alterations in liver parameters were noted \ninconsistently in subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. In dogs, haemolytic \nanaemia was observed.  \nIn a single toxicity study, the absence of corpora lutea was noted at a higher incidence in the ovary of \ntreated compared to control female rats. This isolated finding was not noted in any other study or \nspecies. \n \nAll these findings were noted at doses which were 2-10 times higher than the human dose of \n100 mg/day. \n \nIn the pregnant rat, the transfer of 14C-riluzole across the placenta to the foetus has been detected. In \nrats, riluzole decreased the pregnancy rate and the number of implantations at exposure levels at least \ntwice the systemic exposure of humans given clinical therapy. No malformations were seen in animal \nreproductive studies. \n \nIn lactating rats, 14C-riluzole was detected in milk. \n \n \n6.

What RILUTEK is and what it is used for \n \nWhat RILUTEK is \n \nThe active substance in RILUTEK is riluzole which acts on the nervous system. \n \nWhat RILUTEK is used for \n \nRILUTEK is used in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). \n \nALS is a form of motor neurone disease where attacks of the nerve cells responsible for sending \ninstructions to the muscles lead to weakness, muscle waste and paralysis. \n \nThe destruction of nerve cells in motor neurone disease may be caused by too much glutamate (a \nchemical messenger) in the brain and spinal cord. RILUTEK stops the release of glutamate and this \nmay help in preventing the nerve cells being damaged. \n \nPlease consult your doctor for more information about ALS and the reason why this medicine has been \nprescribed for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take RILUTEK \n\n \nDo not take RILUTEK \n- if you are allergic to riluzole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6), \n- if you have any liver disease or increased blood levels of some enzymes of the liver \n\n(transaminases), \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking RILUTEK: \n- if you have any liver problems: yellowing of your skin or the white of your eyes (jaundice), \n\nitching all over, feeling sick, being sick \n- if your kidneys are not working very well \n- if you have any fever: it may be due to a low number of white blood cells which can cause an \n\nincreased risk of infection \nIf any of the above applies to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor who will decide what to \ndo. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIf you are less than 18 years of age, the use of RILUTEK is not recommended because there is no \ninformation available in this population. \n \nOther medicines and RILUTEK \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou MUST NOT take RILUTEK if you are or think you may be pregnant, or if you are \nbreast-feeding. \n \nIf you think you may be pregnant, or if you intend to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before \ntaking RILUTEK. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou can drive or use any tools or machines, unless you feel dizzy or light headed after taking this \nmedicine. \n \n \n3.  How to take RILUTEK \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet, twice a day.  \nThe tablets should be taken by mouth, every 12 hours, at the same time of the day each day (e.g. in the \nmorning and evening). \n \nIf you take more RILUTEK than you should \n \nIf you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department \nimmediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take RILUTEK \n \nIf you forget to take your tablet, leave out that dose completely and take the next tablet at the usual \ntime. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIMPORTANT \nTell your doctor immediately \n- if you experience any fever (increase in temperature) because RILUTEK may cause a decrease \n\nin the number of white blood cells.
