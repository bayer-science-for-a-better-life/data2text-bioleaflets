This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOpgenra 3.3 mg powder for implantation suspension. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains 1g powder with 3.3 mg of eptotermin alfa*. \n \nAfter reconstitution, Opgenra contains 1 mg/ml eptotermin alfa. \n \n*Eptotermin alfa is human recombinant osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1) produced in Chinese hamster \novary (CHO) cell line. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for implantation suspension. \nThe powder containing the active substance is granular and white to off-white. \nThe powder containing the excipient carmellose (carboxymethylcellulose) is yellowish white. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOpgenra is indicated for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis \nwhere autograft has failed or is contra-indicated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should be used by an appropriately qualified surgeon.  \n \nPosology \n \nOpgenra is intended only for single use in each patient. Treatment requires a single surgery. To fuse a \nsingle level of the lumbar region of the spine, one unit of medicinal product is used on each side of the \nspine. The maximum human dose should not exceed 2 units since efficacy and safety for spinal fusion \nrequiring higher doses has not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOpgenra is contraindicated in children (<12 years old), adolescents (12-18 years old)  and the \nskeletally immature (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \n \nCare should be used when Opgenra is used in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section \n4.4). \n \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intraosseous use. \n \nThe reconstituted product is administered by direct surgical placement into the lumber region of the \nspine following surgical preparation of the site. The surrounding soft tissues are then closed around the \nimplanted material.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nOpgenra must not be used in patients who: \n \n• have a hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1;  \n• have an autoimmune disease, including Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus \n\nerythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis; \n• have an active infection at the site of spinal fusion or history of recurring infections; \n• have inadequate skin coverage and vascularity at the site of spinal fusion; \n• have prior history of exposure to any bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) product; \n• have an active malignancy or are undergoing treatment for a malignancy; \n• require arthrodesis as a result of metabolic bone disease or tumour. \n \nOpgenra is contraindicated in children aged 0 to 12 years old, adolescents aged 12 to 18 years and the \nskeletally immature. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nUse of Opgenra does not guarantee fusion; additional surgeries may be required. \n \nContainment \n \nAny material dislodged from the fusion site can cause ectopic ossification in the surrounding tissues \nwith potential complications. Therefore, Opgenra may only be administered to the fusion site under \nadequate vision and with utmost care. Special care must be taken to prevent any leakage of Opgenra \ndue to irrigation, defective closure of surrounding tissue or inadequate haemostasis. CT examination \nhas suggested that significant medial displacement of Opgenra can occur post-operatively and this can \nresult in bone forming medially. This should be considered in follow-up of patients with CT or X-ray. \n \nImmune response \n \nIn a clinical study of the medicinal product, antibodies to the protein eptotermin alfa were detected in \n194 out of 207 (94%) patients treated with it and 18 out of 86 (21%) treated with autograft bone \n(control group).  Within the test group, 26% of patients produced antibodies with neutralizing capacity \nversus 1% in the control group. The peak antibody response was seen 3 months following treatment. \nThere were no patients with neutralizing antibodies 2 years following treatment. The clinical \nsignificance of these antibodies is not known. The clinical study results suggest that there does not \nappear to be any association between neutralizing antibodies and the development of adverse events \nrelated to the immune system. However, an immune response to eptotermin alfa should be considered \nand appropriate validated tests for the presence of antibodies in serum should be performed in cases \nwhere an immune-mediated undesirable effect is suspected, including cases where the medicinal \nproduct is ineffective. \n \nOpgenra is intended only for single use in each patient. Repeated use of the medicinal product cannot \nbe recommended. Studies with anti-OP-1 antibodies demonstrated some cross-reactivity with closely \nrelated bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-5 and BMP-6. Anti-OP-1 antibodies have the ability to \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nneutralise the in vitro biological activity of at least BMP-6. Therefore, upon re-administration of \nOpgenra, a risk of developing autoimmunity towards the endogenous BMP proteins may exist. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nThere is limited experience on the use of the medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment therefore caution with its use in such patients is advised.  \n \nUse in cervical spine \n \nClinical studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of this medicinal product in cervical spine \nsurgery have not been performed; consequently its use outside the region of the lumbar spine cannot \nbe recommended.  \n \nUse with bone void fillers \n \nThe concomitant use of Opgenra with a synthetic bone void filler is not recommended (see section \n4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nPost-marketing surveillance data includes reports that the use of the medicinal product in combination \nwith a synthetic bone void filler, may lead to an increase in local inflammation, infection and \noccasionally migration of the implanted materials (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception for a period of at \nleast 2 years after treatment. Women of child-bearing potential should inform their surgeon of the \npossibility of pregnancy prior to treatment with Opgenra. \n \nPregnancy \n \nAnimal studies that have been conducted cannot rule out possible effects of anti-OP-1 antibodies on \nembryofoetal development (see section 5.3). Due to the unknown risks to the foetus associated with \nthe potential development of neutralizing antibodies to OP-1 protein, the medicinal product should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risks to the foetus (see \nsection 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIn animal studies, excretion of IgG class anti-OP-1 antibodies into milk was shown. As human IgG is \nsecreted into human milk, and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not \nbreast-feed during Opgenra therapy (see section 5.3). The medicinal product should be used in \nbreast-feeding women only when the attending physician decides that the benefits outweigh the risks. \nIt is recommended that breast-feeding be discontinued following treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOpgenra has no known pharmacological effect on neuro-motor coordination or performance \nconsequently it is unlikely to alter any pre-existing skills used for driving vehicles or operating \nmachines.  \n \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nOpgenra is implanted during an invasive surgical procedure performed under general anaesthesia. \nAdverse events recorded during the clinical studies following such surgery and not specifically \ncausally related to the implanted materials included superficial wound infection, wound dehiscence, \nosteomyelitis, complications of mechanical support, haematoma formation, nausea, vomiting, fever \nand pain. The frequency and severity of post-operative adverse events was similar in both test and \ncontrol groups. The pattern of unrelated post-operative adverse events varied with the extent of \nsurgical trauma, procedural complications and the pre-operative health of the patient.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported with Opgenra. The frequency of adverse reactions \nlisted in the table below is based on the following convention: \n \nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto ≤1/1,000); very rare (≤1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nInfections and infestations Common: post-operative infection  \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon: localised swelling,  \nNot known: implant site complications (e.g. abscess, implant site \ninduration, pain, oedema,  pyrexia) \n\nImmune system disorders Not known: hypersensitivity, urticaria \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\nCommon: wound dehiscence, secretion, pseudarthrosis \nUncommon: product migration when mixed with synthetic bone \nvoid filler, seroma \nNot known: Post-procedural complications (e.g. post procedural \ndischarge, swelling, other wound complications) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nCommon: bone formation increased (heterotopic bone formation) \nNot known: osteolysis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: erythema \n\n \nPre-existing co-morbidities \n \nIn the study populations, some patients with common pre-existing co-morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular, \nrespiratory, genitourinary disorders, neoplasms) experienced exacerbations of their prior disease \nduring the long term (three year) follow up period. Patients with a known history of heart disease or \nfrequent infections should be identified and observed more closely following surgery. \n \nInteraction with bone void fillers \n \nPost-marketing surveillance data includes reports that the use of the medicinal product in combination \nwith a synthetic bone void filler, may lead to an increase in local inflammation, infection and \noccasionally migration of the implanted materials. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for the treatment of bone diseases, bone morphogenetic proteins, \nATC code: M05BC02 \n \nOpgenra is an osteoinductive and osteoconductive medicinal product. \n \nEptotermin alfa, the active substance, initiates bone formation through the induction of cellular \ndifferentiation in mesenchymal cells, which are recruited to the implant site from bone marrow, \nperiosteum and muscle. Once bound at the cell surface, the active substance induces a cascade of \ncellular events leading to the formation of chondroblasts and osteoblasts, which play a key role in the \nbone formation process. The collagen matrix is insoluble and consists of particles with a size range of \n75-425µm. This provides an appropriate bioresorbable scaffold for the anchorage dependent cell \nproliferation and differentiation processes induced by the active substance. The carmellose imparts a \nputty-like consistency to the medicinal product for ease of molding and placement on each side of the \nspine. The cellular events induced by the active substance take place within the product matrix. The \nmatrix is also osteoconductive and it allows bone in-growth into the defect area from the adjacent \nhealthy bone. \n \nThe pivotal study with 295 patients involved un-instrumented postero-lateral lumbar spine fusion in \n208 patients treated with Opgenra.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThere are no data on the pharmacokinetics of the active substance in man. However, results from \nimplantation studies in animals demonstrate that the active substance eptotermin alfa is released from \nthe implant site over several weeks and never reaches a level higher than 3% of the total amount \nimplanted in the peripheral blood. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle dose and repeat dose studies in a range of animal models (rats and primates) were performed. \nThe results of these showed no unanticipated or systemic effects of toxicity during the observation \nperiod and after administration. \n \nIn a 2 year subcutaneous implantation study in rats, heterotopic bone formation was observed, as \nexpected. Sarcoma was associated with the long-term presence of the heterotopic bone. This effect, \ntermed solid state carcinogenicity, has been frequently observed in rats in which solid materials \n(plastics or metals) were implanted subcutaneously. \n \nHeterotopic ossification commonly occurs in humans following accidental or surgical trauma to the \nskeleton. It has been observed following use (see section 4.8). However, there is no evidence to \nsuggest that heterotopic ossification is linked to sarcoma development in humans. \n \nThe effect of anti-OP-1 antibodies on the bone healing process was studied in dogs with two long bone \ndefects treated with repeat implantations. The results of radiological and histological examinations in \nthis study showed bone healing following the initial and repeat exposure in the same animal. \nAntibodies to OP-1 and bovine bone collagen type 1 were found after both exposures. Not \nsurprisingly, the antibody peak concentration was higher after the second exposure. The antibody \nlevels declined towards baseline during the follow-up period. \n \n\n6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nControlled studies of the effects of exposure to eptotermin alfa on pre and postnatal development were \nperformed in rabbit models. Eptotermin alfa in Freund’s adjuvant was first administered \nsubcutaneously with booster doses given after 14 and 28 days. Blood and milk samples were collected \nat regular intervals and analysed using a solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test. \nDetectable levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to eptotermin alfa had developed and were found in the \nserum of all exposed adult animals. Antibodies to eptotermin alfa were also found in sera from pooled \nfoetal and umbilical cord blood, at levels that correlated to that of the maternal blood. Antibodies were \ndetectable in adults and offspring during the gestation and lactation periods. Significantly high titers of \nIgG class anti-OP-1 antibodies were detected in milk throughout the whole post-natal phase study until \nthe lactation day 28 (see section 4.6). \n \nA statistically significant increase in foetal malformations (misaligned sternabrae) was seen in litters \nof the OP-1 immunized group. However the rate of malformations was similar to those from historical \ncontrols.  In another study a difference in body weight gain was seen in the immunized adult females \nbetween lactation days 14 to 21 when compared to the control animals. The weight of the offspring in \nthe treated group was noted to be less than that of the control group during the observation period. The \nclinical implications of these observations for human use of the finished medicinal product remain \nuncertain (see section 4.6). \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nBovine collagen \nCarmellose \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPotential interaction with Calstrux, a bone void filler has been reported (see section 4.5). This \nmedicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section \n6.6.  \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n3 years.  \n \nThe reconstituted medicinal product should be used immediately. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). \n \nKeep the blisters in the outer carton. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nOne unit of Opgenra is supplied in two Type I glass vials, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and \naluminium crimp cap.  \n \nThe vials are maintained sterile within individual blisters and packaged together in an outer tray and \nbox. \n \nOne vial containing 1g of powder (3.3 mg eptotermin alfa); one vial containing 230 mg carmellose \npowder. \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nPack sizes: \n- a single unit pack with 1 vial containing 1g of powder (3.3 mg eptotermin alfa) and 1 vial \n\ncontaining 230 mg carmellose powder \n \n- a pack of two units with 2 x 1 vial containing 1g of powder (3.3 mg eptotermin alfa) and 2 x 1 \n\nvial containing 230 mg carmellose powder. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEach unit of Opgenra consists of two vials of powder, which are first combined and then reconstituted \nwith 2.5 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection prior to use. Once Opgenra is \nprepared it should be used immediately. \n \n1. Using sterile technique, remove the vials from the packaging. \n \n2. Lift the plastic flip-tops and remove the crimp caps from the vials. \n\nHandle the crimp caps with care.  The edges of the crimp caps are sharp and may cut or damage \ngloves. \n\n \n3. Using your thumb pry up the edges of the stoppers.  Once the vacuums are broken, remove the \n\nvial stoppers while holding the vials upright to prevent loss of contents. \n \n\nDo not insert a needle through the stoppers. Puncture of the stoppers with a needle may result in \nparticles of stopper material contaminating the medicinal product. \n\n \n4. Place the contents of the eptotermin alfa vial and carmellose vial in a sterile bowl. To avoid \n\nbreakage, do not tap the bottom of the vial when transferring contents. \n \n5. Using a sterile syringe, add 2.5 ml of sterile 9 mg/ml sodium chloride solution for injection \n\n(0.9% w/v) to the sterile bowl slowly and carefully. \n \n6. Gently stir the contents of the bowl with a sterile spatula to aid mixing. \n \n7. The same procedure should be used to prepare the medicinal product for the contralateral side of \n\nthe spine.  Use the product promptly following reconstitution. \n \n8. Debride and decorticate bone so that the reconstituted medicinal product will directly contact \n\nviable tissue. \n \n9. Provide adequate haemostasis to ensure that the material stays at the surgical site. Irrigate the \n\nsurgical site as necessary prior to the implantation of the medicinal product. Where practical, \nsurgical manipulations to the site should be completed prior to product implantation. \n\n \n10. Remove the reconstituted product from the sterile bowl with a sterile instrument such as a \n\nspatula or curette. The product should have a malleable, coherent putty-like consistency. \n \n11. Carefully apply the product to the prepared site on each side of the spine, bridging the dorsal \n\nsurfaces of the adjacent transverse processes. \n \n12. Close soft tissues around the site containing the product using suture material of choice. Closure \n\nis critical for containment and maintenance of the product in the area of intended fusion. \n \n13. Do not place a drain directly in the implant or fusion site. Place it subcutaneously if possible.  \n \n\n8 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14. After closure of the soft tissues around the implant, irrigate the field if necessary to remove any \nstray particles of the medicinal product which may have been dislodged during soft tissue \nclosure. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information.  You can help by reporting any side effects you may get.  See end of section 4 for \nhow to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are administered this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Opgenra is and what it is used for. \n2. What you need to know before you are administered Opgenra. \n3. How to use Opgenra. \n4. Possible side effects. \n5 How to store Opgenra. \n6. Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n1. What Opgenra is and what it is used for \n \nOpgenra contains the active substance eptotermin alfa. \n \nOpgenra is a type of medicine known as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). This group of \nmedicines cause new bone to grow at the location where the surgeon has placed (implanted) it. \n \nOpgenra is implanted in adult patients with slippage of the spine (spondylolisthesis) in cases where \ntreatment with autograft (transplanted bone from your hip) has failed or must not be used. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are administered Opgenra \n \nDo not use Opgenra \n- if you are allergic  to eptotermin alfa or to any of the ingredients of this medicine (see section \n\n6).  \n- if you have an autoimmune disease (disease arising from or directed against your own tissues), \n\nincluding Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, \nSjögren’s syndrome and dermatomyositis/ polymyositis. \n\n- if you have an active infection in your spine or have been told that you have an active internal \n(systemic) infection. \n\n- if you have inadequate skin coverage and inadequate blood supply at the site of surgery (your \ndoctor should have told you if this is the case). \n\n- have had this medicine, eptotermin alfa or any similar medicine before. \n- have any tumours in the area intended for surgery. \n- if you require a spinal fusion because of a metabolic bone disease or tumours. \n- if you are receiving chemotherapy, radiation treatment or immunosuppression. \n- if you are a child (less than 12 years old). \n- if you are an adolescent (12-18 years old) or your skeleton is not yet be fully formed (you are \n\nstill growing). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n24 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nTalk to your doctor before you are administered this medicine. \n• Use of this medicine does not guarantee fusion. Additional surgeries may be needed. \n• There is a possibility that new antibodies can form in your body when this medicine is used.  It \n\nis possible they may impair the effectiveness of this medicine or cause an immune system \nresponse. \n\n• Inform your doctor or surgeon if you have been administered this medicine in the past. \nRepeated use of this medicine cannot be recommended. Laboratory studies have demonstrated \nthat there is a theoretical risk of developing autoimmunity towards the natural (endogenous) \nBMP proteins in your body following repeat exposure to this medicine. \n\n• Inform your doctor if you have a history of liver or kidney disease. \n• Inform your doctor or surgeon if you have a history of heart problems or are prone to frequent \n\ninfections so that they can closely monitor you. \n• Opgenra has not been studied for use in cervical spine surgery. Use of this medicine in the \n\ncervical spine cannot be recommended. \n• Use of this medicine with synthetic bone substitutes is not recommended. \n \nTalk to your doctor or surgeon about these precautions before you are administered this medicine. \n \nOther medicines and Opgenra \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.   \n \nUse of this medicine with synthetic bone substitutes is not recommended. There have been reports of \nswelling and infection following the use of this medicine with synthetic bone substitutes. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nOpgenra should not be administered during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother outweigh the \nrisks to the unborn child. Women of child-bearing potential should inform their surgeon of the \npossibility of pregnancy before they are administered this medicine. Women of childbearing potential \nare advised to use effective contraception for a period of 2 years after their treatment. \n \nDo not breast-feed your baby during treatment with this medicine. As the potential for harm to the \nbreast fed infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during the period immediately following \ntreatment with this medicine. If you are nursing, you should receive this medicine only if your treating \nphysician or surgeon considers the benefits to you outweigh the risks to your child. \n \nDriving and using machines \n It is unlikely that Opgenra will affect the ability to drive and use machines \n \n \n3. How to use Opgenra  \n \nOpgenra is only used by an appropriately qualified surgeon during the course of spinal fusion surgery.  \nThis is normally done under a full general anaesthetic so you will not be awake during the surgery.   \n \nA small quantity (one unit) of this medicine is reconstituted and placed directly on each side of the \nspine at the site requiring fusion. The surrounding muscle tissue is then closed around the implanted \nmedicine as is the skin on top of the muscle. This specialised medicine is used instead of autograft \nbone (some of a patient’s own bone taken from the hip) to fuse the spine.  \n \nThe maximum dose of this medicine should not exceed 2 units (6.6 mg eptotermin alfa) since its \neffectiveness and safety in higher doses has not been studied. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n25 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nTalk to your doctor if you have any of the following: \n- Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n• redness of the skin (erythema) , \n• increased bone formation or bone formation outside of the fusion area (heterotopic bone \n\nformation), \n• failure of the spine to fuse (pseudarthrosis),  \n• wound  problems including infection, discharge and rupture. \n\n \n- Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n• localised swelling, swelling over the implant site,  \n• collection of fluid in the tissues (seroma), \n• product migration (this has been observed when the product was mixed with a synthetic \n\nproduct used to fill the bone void) \n  \n-  Not known (cannot be estimated from available data) \n\n• problems at the implant site (for example abscess, hardening, pain, swelling, or fever) \n• allergic reactions (for example rash or hives) \n• post-surgery problems (for example discharge, swelling or other wound complications) \n• resorption of bone (osteolysis). \n\n \nSome patients that had a history of heart problems or were prone to frequent infections became worse \nafter being administered this medicine. Inform your doctor or surgeon if you have a history of heart \nproblems or are prone to frequent infections so that they can closely monitor you. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or surgeon.

Indeed, there has been a limited \nexposure due to a recent and limited marketing of the product (launched in the EU only in August \n2011 and marketed in only few Member States). In addition, results of the post-authorisation studies to \ninvestigate the long term safety and efficacy of Opgenra and also investigate the actual drug utilisation \nin ‘real life’ are needed to further characterise the safety and efficacy profile. \n \n \n\n29 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
