PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion. \n \nClear colourless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles with a pH of 6.0 – 7.2 and an \nosmolality between 253 and 284 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrepulmix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) III or IV \nand: \n\n- inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or  \n- persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment  \n\nto improve exercise capacity. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \nTreatment with Trepulmix should be initiated and monitored only by clinicians experienced in the \ntreatment of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment should be initiated under close medical supervision \nin a medical setting able to provide intensive care. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial infusion rate is 1.25 ng/kg/min. If this initial dose is poorly tolerated, the \ninfusion rate should be reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min. \n \nDose adjustments \nThe infusion rate should be increased under medical supervision in increments of up to 1.25 ng/kg/min \nper week for the first four weeks of treatment and then up to 2.5 ng/kg/min per week.   \n \nThe dose should be adjusted on an individual basis and under medical supervision in order to achieve \na maintenance dose at which symptoms improve and which is tolerated by the patient.  \n \nDuring the follow-up phase of a clinical trial in CTEPH patients, the mean doses reached after 12 \nmonths were 31 ng/kg/min, after 24 months 33 ng/kg/min, and after 48 months 39 ng/kg/min. The \nrespective maximum doses observed in the clinical trial were 52 ng/kg/min, 54 ng/kg/min and \n50 ng/kg/min respectively. \n \nAbrupt withdrawal or sudden marked reductions in the dose of treprostinil may cause a rebound of \nsymptoms of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is therefore recommended that \ninterruption of treprostinil therapy is avoided and that the infusion is re-started as soon as possible \nafter an abrupt accidental dose reduction or interruption. The optimal strategy for reintroducing \ntreprostinil infusion needs to be determined on a case by case basis by medically qualified personnel. \nIn most cases, after an interruption of up to 4 hours, restarting of treprostinil infusion can be done \nusing the same dose rate; interruptions for up to 24 hours may require a dose reduction of up to 50% of \nthe most recent dose with a subsequent uptitration to the clinically effective dose. Longer periods of \ninterruption may require the dose of treprostinil to be re-titrated from even lower flow rates. In any \ncase, the reintroduction of treprostinil should be under medical supervision. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic impairment \nThe initial dose of Trepulmix should be decreased to 0.625 ng/kg/min and incremental dose increases \nshould be made cautiously (see section 5.2). Increments could be reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min per dose \nincrease, the final decision on the dose increments is at the discretion of the supervising physician. \nPlease note that “Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) is listed as contraindication for use \nof treprostinil, see section 4.3. \n \nRenal impairment \nAs no clinical studies have been carried out in patients with renal impairment, the treatment \nrecommendations are not established for patients with renal impairment. As treprostinil and its \nmetabolites are excreted mainly through the urinary route, caution is recommended when treating \npatients with renal impairment in order to prevent deleterious consequences related to the possible \nincrease of systemic exposure. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nElderly  \nNo pharmacokinetic data of treprostinil in elderly is available. Caution is recommended when treating \nelderly patients due to higher incidence of hepatic and / or renal impairment. \n \n  \nObese patients \nTherapy of obese patients (weight ≥ 30% above ideal weight) should be initiated and increased with \ndoses calculated based on their ideal weight. See section 5.2 for more information. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of treprostinil in children and adolescents for the indication of CTEPH. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrepulmix is for subcutaneous use. It is administered undiluted by continuous infusion via a \nsubcutaneous catheter using an ambulatory infusion pump. \n  \nThe healthcare professional responsible for the therapy must ensure that the patient is fully trained and \ncompetent to use the chosen infusion device.  All patients must be trained in preparation of the \ntreprostinil infusion reservoir and priming of the infusion delivery tubing and connection. Written \nguidance, either from the pump manufacturer or specially tailored advice by the prescribing physician \nmust be made available to the patient. This includes the required normal drug delivery actions, advice \nhow to manage occlusions and other pump alarms, and details whom to contact in an emergency. \n \nIn order to avoid interruptions in drug delivery, the patient must have access to a backup infusion \npump and subcutaneous infusion sets in the event that the administration equipment should suffer an \naccidental malfunction. \n \nThe ambulatory infusion pump used to administer undiluted Trepulmix subcutaneously, should be: \n\n• small and lightweight, \n• capable of adjusting infusion rates in increments of 0.002 ml/h or less, \n• fitted with occlusion, low battery, programming error and motor malfunction alarms, \n• accurate to within +/- 6% of the programmed delivery rate  \n• positive pressure driven (continuous or pulsated). \n\n \nThe reservoir must be made of polypropylene or glass. \n \nPatients must be thoroughly trained in the use and programming of the pump, and the connection and \ncare of the infusion set. \n \nFlushing the infusion line whilst connected to the patient may lead to accidental overdose. For more \ninformation on the symptoms and treatment of overdose please refer to Section 4.9 of this document. \n \nTrepulmix is available at concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml. \n \nFor subcutaneous infusion, Trepulmix is delivered without further dilution at a calculated \nsubcutaneous infusion rate (ml/h) based on a patient’s dose (ng/kg/min), weight (kg), and the vial \nstrength (mg/ml) of Trepulmix being used. During use a single reservoir (syringe) of undiluted \nTrepulmix can be administered up to 72 hours at 37°C. The subcutaneous infusion rate is calculated \nusing the following formula: \n \n \n \n \n \n*Conversion factor of 0.00006 = 60 min/hour x 0.000001 mg/ng \n\nSubcutaneous \nInfusion Rate \n\n(ml/h) \n= \n\nDose (ng/kg/min) x Weight (kg) x 0.00006* \n\nTrepulmix Vial Strength (mg/ml) \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTo avoid calculation errors due to the complex formula please check the dose calculation tables \nbelow. For each medicinal product strength one dose calculation table is available. \n \nExample calculations for subcutaneous infusion are as follows: \n \nExample 1: \n \nFor a 60 kg person at the recommended initial dose of 1.25 ng/kg/min using the 1 mg/ml Trepulmix \nVial Strength, the infusion rate would be calculated as follows: \n \n\nSubcutaneous \nInfusion Rate \n\n(ml/h) \n= 1.25 ng/kg/min x 60 kg x 0.00006 =  0.005 ml/h 1 mg/ml \n\n \n \nExample 2: \n \nFor a 65 kg person at a dose of 40 ng/kg/min using the 5 mg/ml Trepulmix Vial Strength, the infusion \nrate would be calculated as follows: \n \n\nSubcutaneous \nInfusion Rate \n\n(ml/h) \n= \n\n40 ng/kg/min x 65 kg x 0.00006 \n=  0.031 ml/h 5 mg/ml \n\n \n \n\n \nTable 1-1 provides guidance for subcutaneous infusion delivery rates of Trepulmix 1 mg/ml for \npatients of different body weights corresponding to doses of up to 42.5 ng/kg/min. \n \nTable 1-1: \n\nInfusion rate setting of subcutaneous pump

indicate the highest infusion rate supported by a 3 ml syringe change every three days. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. \n• Severe decompensated left heart failure. \n• Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n• Active gastrointestinal ulcer, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal injury or other \n\ngastrointestinal bleeding.  \n• Congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial dysfunction not related \n\nto pulmonary hypertension. \n• Severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina \n• Myocardial infarction within the last six months \n• Severe arrhythmias \n• Cerebrovascular events (e.g. transient ischaemic attack, stroke) within the last three months. \n• Co-administration with other prostanoids \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral therapy \nThe decision to initiate therapy with treprostinil should take into consideration the high probability \nthat continuous infusion will have to be continued for a prolonged period. Thus the patient's ability to \naccept and to be responsible for an indwelling catheter and infusion device should be carefully \nconsidered. The clinical team responsible for the therapy must ensure that the patient is fully trained \nand competent to use the chosen infusion device (see section 4.2). \n \nTreprostinil is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In subjects presenting with low systemic \narterial pressure, treprostinil treatment may increase the risk of systemic hypotension. Treatment is not \nrecommended for patients with systolic arterial pressure of less than 85 mmHg. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nIt is recommended to monitor systemic blood pressure and heart rate during any change in dose with \ninstructions to stop the infusion if symptoms of hypotension develop, or a systolic blood pressure of \n85 mmHg or lower is detected. \n \nIf a patient develops pulmonary oedema while on treprostinil, the possibility of an concomitant \npulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered. The treatment should be stopped as \npulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a contraindication for therapy with treprostinil (see section 4.3). \n \nCaution is advised in situations where treprostinil may increase the risk of bleeding by inhibiting \nplatelet aggregation (see section 4.5 and 4.8).   \n \nWithdrawal \nAbrupt withdrawal or sudden marked reductions in the dose of treprostinil may cause a rebound in \npulmonary hypertension (see section 4.2).  \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with hepatic and renal impairment should be dosed cautiously (see section 4.2). \nAs treprostinil and its metabolites are excreted mainly through the urinary route, caution is \nrecommended when treating patients with renal impairment in order to prevent deleterious \nconsequences related to the possible increase of systemic exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nSodium content \nTrepulmix 1 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 36.8 mg sodium per 10 ml vial of 1mg/ml, equivalent to 1.8% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTrepulmix 2.5 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 37.3 mg mg sodium per 10 ml vial of 2.5 mg/ml, equivalent to 1.9% \nof the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTrepulmix 5 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 39.1 mg sodium per 10 ml vial of 5 mg/ml, equivalent to 2.0% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTrepulmix 10 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains 37.4 mg sodium per 10 ml vial of 10 mg/ml, equivalent to 1.9% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTo be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nConcomitant medicinal products \nConcomitant administration of cytochrome P450 (CYP2C8) enzyme inhibitors (as gemfibrozil) may \nlead to increased exposure (both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. With an increased exposure there is a \nlikelihood of a higher incidence of adverse events associated with the administration of treprostinil. \nTherefore, a dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.5).  \n \nConcomitant administration of CYP2C8 enzyme inducers (for example rifampicin) may result in a \ndecreased exposure to treprostinil. At a reduced exposure, it is likely to have decreased clinical \nefficacy. Therefore, a higher dose of treprostinil is to be considered (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant administration with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators \n \nConcomitant administration of treprostinil with diuretics, antihypertensive agents or other vasodilators \nincreases the risk of systemic hypotension.  \n \nConcomitant administration with platelet aggregation inhibitors, including NSAIDs and anticoagulants \n \nTreprostinil may inhibit platelet function. Concomitant administration of treprostinil with platelet \naggregation inhibitors, including NSAIDs, nitric oxide donors or anticoagulants may increase the risk \nof bleeding. Surveillance of patients taking anticoagulants should be closely maintained. The \nconcomitant use of other platelet inhibitors should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants.  \n \nConcomitant administration with cytochrome P450 (CYP2C8) enzyme inducers/inhibitors  \n \nGemfibrozil and other CYP2C8 inhibitors \nPharmacokinetic studies in humans with oral treprostinil diolamine indicated that the concomitant \nadministration of cytochrome P450 (CYP2C8) enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil doubles the exposure \n(both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. In case a CYP2C8 inhibitor (e.g. gemfibrozil, trimethoprim and \ndeferasirox) is added to or omitted from the patient’s treatment after the titration phase, a dose \nadjustment of treprostinil has to be considered. \n \nRifampicin and other CYP2C8 inducers \nPharmacokinetic studies in humans with oral treprostinil diolamine indicated that the concomitant \nadministration of CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduced (by about 20%) exposure \nto treprostinil. In case rifampicin is added to or omitted from the patient’s treatment after the titration \nphase, a dose adjustment of treprostinil has to be considered. \n \nAlso other CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort) may \nlead to reduced exposure to treprostinil. In case a CYP2C8 inhibitor is added to or omitted from the \npatient’s treatment after the titration phase, a dose adjustment of treprostinil has to be considered. \n \nConcomitant administration with bosentan \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in humans, in which bosentan (250 mg/day) and treprostinil diolamine \n(oral dose of 2 mg/day) were administered concomitantly, no pharmacokinetic interaction between \ntreprostinil and bosentan was observed.  \n \nConcomitant administration with sildenafil  \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in humans, in which sildenafil (60mg/day) and treprostinil diolamine (oral \ndose of 2 mg/day) were administered concomitantly, no pharmacokinetic interaction between \ntreprostinil and sildenafil was observed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of treprostinil in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3). Treprostinil should only be used \nduring pregnancy if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nContraception is recommended during treprostinil treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether treprostinil is excreted in human milk. Breastfeeding women taking \ntreprostinil should be advised to discontinue breastfeeding. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTreprostinil has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines at the initiation of treatment \nor dose adjustments. They may be accompanied by undesirable effects such as symptomatic systemic \nhypotension or dizziness which may impair ability to drive and operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nIn addition to local effects resulting from the administration of treprostinil by subcutaneous infusion \nsuch as infusion site pain and infusion site reaction, adverse reactions with treprostinil are related to \nthe pharmacological properties of prostacyclins. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA system organ \nclass. The incidence of the adverse reactions below are expressed according to the following \ncategories: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).  \n \nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Incidence \nNervous system disorders Headache Very common \n Dizziness Common \nEye disorders Eyelid oedema Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Vasodilatation Very common \n Hypotension Common \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Very common \n Nausea Very common \n Dyspepsia Uncommon \n Vomiting Uncommon \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash Common \n\n Pruritus Uncommon \n Exanthema Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal, connective \ntissue disorders \n\nJaw pain Very common \n\n Myalgia, arthalgia Common \n Pain in extremities Common \n Back pain Uncommon \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInfusion site pain, infusion site \nreaction, bleeding or \nhaematoma \n\nVery common \n\n Oedema Common \n Flushing Common \n Decreased appetite Uncommon \n Fatigue Uncommon \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nBleeding events  \nDue to its effects on platelet aggregation, treprostinil may increase the risk of bleeding, as observed by \nan increased incidence of epistaxis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (including GI haemorrhage, \nrectal haemorrhage, gum haemorrhage and melaena) in controlled clinical trials in PAH. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nEvents Observed During Clinical Practice: \nIn addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials in PAH patients, the following events have \nbeen identified during post-approval use of treprostinil in other indications. Because they are reported \nvoluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The following \nevents were reported: infusion site infection, subcutaneous infusion site abscess formation, \nthrombocytopenia, and bone pain. \nIn addition, generalised rashes, sometimes macular or papular in nature, and cellulitis have been \ninfrequently reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.* \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms of overdose with treprostinil include flushing, headache, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, \nand diarrhoea. Patients experiencing symptoms of overdose should, after consultation with their \nphysician, immediately reduce their dose of treprostinil depending on the severity of the symptoms \nuntil the symptoms of overdose have resolved. Dosing should be recommenced with caution under \nmedical control and patients monitored closely for recurrence of unwanted symptoms. \n \nNo antidote is known. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin \nATC code: B01AC21 \n \nMechanism of action  \nTreprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue. \nIt exerts a direct vasodilation effect on the pulmonary and systemic arterial circulation and, inhibits \nplatelet aggregation.   \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nIn a randomised, multi-centre, controlled clinical trial, a total of 105 male (53.3%) and female (46.7%) \nadult patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary \nendarterectomy (18-88 years of age, mean 64 years) were treated. Patients were required to have \nCTEPH classified as severe, as defined by an un-encouraged six-minute walk test (6MWT) of between \n150 and 400 meters and a classification in the WHO/NYHA functional class III or IV. Patients were \ndivided into two treprostinil treatment groups (53 high dose and 52 low dose patients, treated with \nsubcutaneous infusion for a total of 24 weeks) as follows. In the high dose group, patients were \nadministered a subcutaneous dose via infusion pump that increased from approximately 1 to a target \ndose of approximately 30 ng/kg/min for the first 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of stable perfusion; \nin the low dose group, the target dose was approximately 3 ng/kg/min following the same schedule.  \n  \nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the individual difference between the 6MWT data at \nbaseline and after 24 weeks. Treprostinil improved the six-minute walk distance (6MWT, six-minute \nwalk test: baseline vs. 24 weeks of treatment) by a mean of 45.43 m in the high dose group versus 3.83 \nm in the low dose group (p<0.05, ANCOVA). Exploratory secondary efficacy (low vs. high) \nmeasures, after 24 weeks of treatment, showed -significant improvements in New York Heart \nAssociation functional (NYHA ) class, haemodynamic parameters (mean pulmonary vascular \n\n\n\n12 \n\nresistance, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean cardiac output, and mean cardiac index) and \nmedian pro-BNP (brain natriuretic peptide values) in favor of the high dose group. No significant \ndifferences between the two test groups in the number of patients showing a \"clinical worsening\", \ndefined as a reduction of 6MWD of 20% compared to baseline, worsening of NYHA functional class \nand/or hospitalisation due to CTEPH with the need of additional pulmonary hypertension specific \ntreatment, were observed. High dose treprostinil showed no significant changes in the Borg Dyspnoea \nScore (measured during the 6MWT), or the summed Quality of Life score as assessed by the \nMinnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nIn humans, steady-state plasma concentrations are usually achieved within 15 to 18 hours of the \ninitiation of either subcutaneous or intravenous infusion of treprostinil. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations of treprostinil are dose-proportional at infusion rates of 2.5 up to 125 ng/kg/min.  \n \nThe mean apparent elimination half-life following subcutaneous administration ranged from 1.32 to \n1.42 hours after infusions over 6 hours, 4.61 hours after infusions over 72 hours, and 2.93 hours after \ninfusions lasting at least three weeks. The mean volume of distribution for treprostinil ranged from \n1.11 to 1.22 l/kg, and plasma clearance ranged from 586.2 to 646.9 ml/kg/h. Clearance is lower in \nobese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2). \n \nIn a seven-day chronic pharmacokinetic study in 14 healthy volunteers with treprostinil doses ranging \nfrom 2.5 to 15 ng/kg/min administered by subcutaneous infusion, steady state plasma treprostinil \nconcentrations reached peak levels twice (at 1 a.m. and 10 a.m. respectively) and trough levels twice \n(at 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. respectively). The peak concentrations were approximately 20% to 30% higher \nthan the trough concentrations. \n \nElimination \nIn a study conducted on healthy volunteers using [14C] radioactive treprostinil, 78.6% and 13.4% of \nthe subcutaneous radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and faeces respectively over a period of \n224 hours. No single major metabolite was observed. Five metabolites were detected in the urine, \nranging from 10.2% to 15.5% of the dose administered. These five metabolites accounted for a \ncombined total of 64.4%. Three are products of oxidation of the 3-hydroxyloctyl side chain, one is a \nglucuroconjugated derivative (treprostinil glucuronide) and one is unidentified. Only 3.7% of the dose \nwas recovered in the urine as unchanged parent drug. \n \nAn in vitro study demonstrated no inhibitory potential of treprostinil to human hepatic microsomal \ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A). \n \nMoreover, administration of treprostinil had no inducing effect on hepatic microsomal protein, total \ncytochrome (CYP) P 450 content or on the activities of the isoenzymes CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP3A. \n \nHepatic Insufficiency  \nIn patients with portopulmonary hypertension and mild (n=4) or moderate (n=5) hepatic insufficiency, \ntreprostinil at a subcutaneous dose of 10 ng/kg/min for 150 minutes had an AUC 0-24 h that was \nincreased 260 % and 510 %, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. Clearance in patients with \nhepatic insufficiency was reduced by up to 80% compared to healthy adults (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly patients \nIn a multivariate analysis of pooled studies, patients in the age group ≥65 years had a small reduction \nin plasma clearance of treprostinil. However, most publications regarded either healthy volunteers or \npatient with PAH. CTEPH patients were rarely described. Age stratification was not performed in any \npublication. As only few studies reported on PK parameters but none reported both on CTEPH \nindication and PK data, no information is available on the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil in elderly \npatients. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n5.3. Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction. \n \nIn 13 and 26 week studies continuous subcutaneous infusions of treprostinil sodium caused infusion \nsite reactions in rats and dogs (oedema/erythema, masses/swellings, pain/sensitivity to touch). In dogs \nsevere clinical effects (hypoactivity, emesis, loose stool and infusion site oedema) and death \n(associated with intestinal intussusceptions and rectal prolapse) were observed in animals administered \n≥300ng/kg/min. Mean steady state plasma treprostinil levels of 7.85ng/ml were measured in these \nanimals. Plasma levels of this order may be achieved in humans treated with treprostinil infusions at \n>50ng/kg/min. \n \nAs a continuously sufficient exposure to treprostinil has not been proven for any dosage tested in the \nreproductive studies in rats, these studies might be insufficient regarding possible effects on fertility, \nprenatal and postnatal development. \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate treprostinil’s carcinogenic potential.   \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Trepulmix is and what it is used for \n2.  What you need to know before you use Trepulmix \n3.  How to use Trepulmix \n4.  Possible side effects \n5.  How to store Trepulmix \n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trepulmix is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Trepulmix is \nThe active ingredient of Trepulmix is treprostinil. \nTreprostinil belongs to a group of medicines which work in a similar way to the naturally occurring \nprostacyclins. Prostacyclins are hormone-like substances which reduce blood pressure by relaxing \nblood vessels, causing them to widen, which allows the blood to flow more easily. Prostacyclins can \nalso have an influence in preventing blood from clotting. \n \nWhat Trepulmix is used to treat \nTrepulmix is used for the treatment of adult patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic \npulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment \n(severity classified WHO Functional Class (FC) III or IV), to improve exercise capacity and \nsymptoms of the disease. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is a condition where \nyour blood pressure is too high in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs causing \nshortness of breath, dizziness, tiredness, fainting, palpitations or abnormal heartbeat, dry cough, \nchest pain and swollen ankles or legs. \n \nHow Trepulmix works \nTrepulmix lowers blood pressure within the pulmonary artery by improving blood flow and reducing \nthe amount of work for the heart. Improved blood flow leads to an increased supply of oxygen to the \nbody and reduced strain on the heart, causing it to function more effectively. Trepulmix improves \nthe symptoms associated with CTEPH and the ability to exercise in patients who are limited in terms \nof activity.  \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Trepulmix \n \nDo not use Trepulmix: \n- if you are allergic to treprostinil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n- if you have been diagnosed with a disease called “pulmonary veno-occlusive disease”. This is a \n\ndisease in which the blood vessels that carry blood through your lungs become swollen and \nclogged resulting in a higher pressure in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs. \n\n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have a heart problem, for example: \n\n• a heart attack (myocardial infarction) within the last six months \n• severe changes in heart rate \n• severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina \n• a heart defect has been diagnosed, such as a faulty heart valve that causes the \n\nheart to work poorly \n• any disease of the heart which is not being treated or not under close \n\nmedical observation \n- if you are at a specific high risk of bleeding – for example active stomach ulcers, injuries or \n\nother bleeding conditions \n- if you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other interruption of blood supply to \n\nthe brain \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Trepulmix if you: \n- suffer from any liver disease \n- suffer from kidney disease \n- have been advised that you are medically obese (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2) \n- are on a low sodium diet \n \nDuring your treatment with Trepulmix, tell your doctor: \n- if your blood pressure decreases (hypotension) \n- if you experience a rapid increase in breathing difficulties or persistent cough (this can be \n\nrelated to congestion in the lungs or asthma or other condition), consult your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n- if you have excessive bleeding as treprostinil may increase the risk, by preventing your blood \nfrom clotting \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTrepulmix must not be used in children and adolescents. \n   \nOther medicines and Trepulmix \nTell your doctor if you are taking/using, have recently taken/used or might take/use any other \nmedicines. Please tell your doctor if you are taking: \n- medicines used to treat high blood pressure (antihypertensive medicines or other vasodilators) \n- medicines used to increase the rate of urination (diuretics) including furosemide \n- medicines that stop blood clotting (anticoagulants) such as warfarin, heparin or nitric oxide \n\nbased products \n- any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medicines (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen) \n- medicines which may enhance or weaken the effects of Trepulmix (e.g. gemfibrozil, rifampicin, \n\ntrimethoprim, deferasirox, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort.), as your \ndoctor may need to adjust the dosage of Trepulmix. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTrepulmix is not recommended if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or think that you \nmight be pregnant, unless considered essential by your doctor. The safety of this medicine for use \nduring pregnancy has not been established. \n \nContraception is strongly recommended during Trepulmix treatment. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nTrepulmix is not recommended for use in breast-feeding, unless considered essential by your doctor. \nYou are advised to stop breast-feeding if Trepulmix is prescribed for you, because it is not known \nwhether this medicine passes into breast milk.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \nDriving and using machines \nTrepulmix may induce low blood pressure with dizziness or fainting. In such a case do not drive or \noperate machinery and ask your doctor for advice. \n \nTrepulmix contains sodium \nPlease tell your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet. They will take into account:  \nTrepulmix 1 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains 36.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.  \n \nTrepulmix 2.5 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains 37.3 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 1.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.  \n \nTrepulmix 5 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains 39.1 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 2.0% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.  \n \nTrepulmix 10 mg/ml solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains 37.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 1.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.  \n \n \n3.  How to use Trepulmix \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nTrepulmix is administered undiluted as a continuous subcutaneous infusion (under the skin) via a \nsmall tube (cannula) which is located in your abdomen or thigh; \n \nTrepulmix is pushed through the tubing by a portable pump.  \n \nBefore you leave the hospital or clinic, your doctor will tell you how to prepare Trepulmix and at \nwhat rate the pump should deliver your treprostinil. Information on how to use the pump correctly \nand what to do if it stops working should also be given to you. The information should also tell you \nwho to contact in an emergency. \n \nFlushing of the infusion line whilst connected may cause accidental overdose. \n \nAdult patients \nTrepulmix is available as 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml or 10 mg/ml solution for infusion. Your doctor \nwill determine the infusion rate and dose appropriate for your condition. \n \nElderly patients \nNo special dose adjustments are necessary for these patients. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \nPatients with liver or kidney disease \nYour doctor will determine the infusion rate and dose appropriate for your condition. \n \nInfusion rate \nThe infusion rate can be reduced or increased on an individual basis under medical supervision only. \n \nThe aim of adjusting the infusion rate is to establish an effective maintenance rate which improves \nsymptoms of CTEPH while minimising any undesirable effects. \n \nIf your symptoms increase or if you need complete rest, or are confined to your bed or chair, or if any \nphysical activity brings on discomfort and your symptoms occur at rest, do not increase your dose \nwithout medical advice. Trepulmix may no longer be sufficient to treat your disease and another \ntreatment may be required. \n \nIf you use more Trepulmix than you should \nIf you accidentally overdose  Trepulmix, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, low blood \npressure (dizziness, light-headedness or fainting), skin flushes and/or headaches. \n \nIf any of these effects become severe you should contact your doctor or hospital immediately. Your \ndoctor may reduce or discontinue the infusion until your symptoms have disappeared. Trepulmix \nsolution for infusion will then be reintroduced at a dose level recommended by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using Trepulmix \nAlways use Trepulmix as directed by your doctor or hospital specialist. Do not stop using Trepulmix \nunless your doctor has advised you to. \n \nAbrupt withdrawal or sudden reductions in the dose of Trepulmix may cause the pulmonary arterial \nhypertension to return with the potential for rapid and severe deterioration in your condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4.
