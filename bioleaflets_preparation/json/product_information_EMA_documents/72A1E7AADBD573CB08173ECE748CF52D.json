NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGANFORT 0.3 mg/ml + 5 mg/ml eye drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 0.3 mg of bimatoprost and 5 mg of timolol (as 6.8 mg of timolol maleate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach ml of solution contains 0.05 mg of benzalkonium chloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution. \n \nColourless to slightly yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \nhypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nRecommended dosage in adults (including older people) \nThe recommended dose is one drop of GANFORT in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered \neither in the morning or in the evening. It should be administered at the same time each day. \n \nExisting literature data for GANFORT suggest that evening dosing may be more effective in IOP \nlowering than morning dosing. However, consideration should be given to the likelihood of \ncompliance when considering either morning or evening dosing (see section 5.1). \n \nIf one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \nexceed one drop in the affected eye(s) daily. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nGANFORT has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Therefore caution \nshould be used in treating such patients.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of GANFORT in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. No data \nare available. \n\nMethod of administration \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is to be used, each one should be instilled at \nleast 5 minutes apart. \n \nWhen using nasolacrimal occlusion or closing the eyelids for 2 minutes, the systemic absorption is \nreduced. This may result in a decrease in systemic side effects and an increase in local activity. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, severe \n\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, second or third degree atrioventricular \n\nblock, not controlled with pace-maker. Overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLike other topically applied ophthalmic medicinal products, the active substances (timolol/ \nbimatoprost) in GANFORT may be absorbed systemically. No enhancement of the systemic \nabsorption of the individual active substances has been observed. Due to the beta-adrenergic \ncomponent, timolol, the same types of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other adverse reactions as seen \nwith systemic beta-blockers may occur. Incidence of systemic ADRs after topical ophthalmic \nadministration is lower than for systemic administration. To reduce the systemic absorption, see \nsection 4.2. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPatients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease, Prinzmetal's angina and cardiac \nfailure) and hypotension therapy with beta-blockers should be critically assessed and therapy with \nother active substances should be considered. Patients with cardiovascular diseases should be watched \nfor signs of deterioration of these diseases and of adverse reactions. \n\nDue to its negative effect on conduction time, beta-blockers should only be given with caution to \npatients with first degree heart block. \n\nVascular disorders \nPatients with severe peripheral circulatory disturbance/disorders (i.e. severe forms of Raynaud’s \ndisease or Raynaud’s syndrome) should be treated with caution. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nRespiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma have been \nreported following administration of some ophthalmic beta-blockers. \n \nGANFORT should be used with caution, in patients with mild/moderate chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD) and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nEndocrine disorders \nBeta-adrenergic blocking medicinal products should be administered with caution in patients subject \nto spontaneous hypoglycemia or to patients with labile diabetes as beta-blockers may mask the signs \nand symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. \n \nBeta-blockers may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. \n \nCorneal diseases \nOphthalmic β-blockers may induce dryness of eyes. Patients with corneal diseases should be treated \nwith caution. \n \nOther beta-blocking agents \nThe effect on intra-ocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta-blockade may be potentiated \nwhen timolol is given to the patients already receiving a systemic beta-blocking agent. The response of \nthese patients should be closely observed. The use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \n\n\n\n4 \n\nWhile taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction \nto a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge with such allergens and \nunresponsive to the usual dose of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions. \n \nChoroidal detachment \nChoroidal detachment has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g. \ntimolol, acetazolamide) after filtration procedures. \n \nSurgical anaesthesia \nβ-blocking ophthalmological preparations may block systemic β-agonist effects e.g. of adrenaline. The \nanaesthesiologist should be informed when the patient is receiving timolol. \n \nHepatic \nIn patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at baseline, bimatoprost had no adverse reactions on liver \nfunction over 24 months. There are no known adverse reactions of ocular timolol on liver function. \n \nOcular  \nBefore treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth, \ndarkening of the eyelid or periocular skin and increased brown iris pigmentation since these have been \nobserved during treatment with bimatoprost and GANFORT. Increased iris pigmentation is likely to \nbe permanent, and may lead to differences in appearance between the eyes if only one eye is treated. \nAfter discontinuation of GANFORT, pigmentation of iris may be permanent. After 12 months \ntreatment with GANFORT, the incidence of iris pigmentation was 0.2%. After 12 months treatment \nwith bimatoprost eye drops alone, the incidence was 1.5% and did not increase following 3 years \ntreatment. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than \nto an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iridial pigmentation \nare not known.  Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be \nnoticeable for several months to years. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by \ntreatment. Periorbital tissue pigmentation has been reported to be reversible in some patients. \n \nMacular oedema, including cystoid macular oedema, has been reported with GANFORT. Therefore, \nGANFORT should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn \nposterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. intraocular \nsurgery, retinal vein occlusions, ocular inflammatory disease and diabetic retinopathy).   \nGANFORT should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g. uveitis) \nbecause the inflammation may be exacerbated. \n \nSkin  \nThere is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where GANFORT solution comes repeatedly in \ncontact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply GANFORT as instructed and avoid it \nrunning onto the cheek or other skin areas.  \n \nExcipients \nThe preservative in GANFORT, benzalkonium chloride, may cause eye irritation. Contact lenses must \nbe removed prior to application, with at least a 15-minute wait before reinsertion. Benzalkonium \nchloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses.  Contact with soft contact lenses must be avoided. \n \nBenzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative \nkeratopathy. Therefore monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use of GANFORT in dry \neye patients or where the cornea is compromised. \n \nOther conditions \nGANFORT has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, \ninflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been \nshown that more frequent exposure of the eye to more than 1 dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease \nthe IOP-lowering effect. Patients using GANFORT with other prostaglandin analogues should be \nmonitored for changes to their intraocular pressure. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with the bimatoprost / timolol fixed combination. \n \nThere is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension, and/or marked bradycardia when  \nophthalmic beta-blockers solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, \nguanethidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, parasympathomimetics, anti-arrhythmics (including \namiodarone) and digitalis glycosides. \n \nPotentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during \ncombined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and timolol. \n \nMydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta-blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) \nhas been reported occasionally. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of the bimatoprost / timolol fixed combination in pregnant \nwomen. GANFORT should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. To reduce the \nsystemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n \nBimatoprost \nNo adequate clinical data in exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies have shown \nreproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \n \nTimolol  \nEpidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but shown a risk for intra uterine \ngrowth retardation when beta-blockers are administered by the oral route. In addition, signs and \nsymptoms of beta-blockade (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia) \nhave been observed in the neonate when beta-blockers have been administered until delivery. If \nGANFORT is administered until delivery, the neonate should be carefully monitored during the first \ndays of life. Animal studies with timolol have shown reproductive toxicity at doses significantly \nhigher than would be used in clinical practice (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nTimolol  \nBeta-blockers are excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of timolol in eye drops it is \nnot likely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk to produce clinical symptoms of \nbeta-blockade in the infant. To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n \nBimatoprost \nIt is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk but it is excreted in the milk of the \nlactating rat. GANFORT should not be used by breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of GANFORT on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nGANFORT has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular \ntreatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears \nbefore driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGANFORT \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reactions reported in clinical studies using GANFORT were limited to those earlier \nreported for either of the single active substances bimatoprost and timolol. No new adverse reactions \nspecific for GANFORT have been observed in clinical studies.  \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions reported in clinical studies using GANFORT were ocular, mild in \nseverity and none were serious. Based on 12-month clinical data, the most commonly reported adverse \nreaction was conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory \nnature) in approximately 26% of patients and led to discontinuation in 1.5% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 presents the adverse reactions that have been reported during clinical studies with all \nGANFORT formulations (multi-dose and single-dose) (within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness) or in the post-marketing period. \n \nThe frequency of possible adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nVery common ≥1/10 \nCommon ≥1/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon ≥1/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare <1/10,000 \nNot known Frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n \nTable 1 \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Not known hypersensitivity reactions \n\nincluding signs or symptoms of \nallergic dermatitis, angioedema, \neye allergy \n\nPsychiatric disorders Not known Insomnia2, nightmare2 \nNervous system disorders \n \n\nCommon headache \nNot known Dysgeusia2, dizziness \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nVery common conjunctival hyperaemia. \nCommon punctuate keratitis, corneal \n\nerosion2, burning sensation2, \nconjunctival irritation1, eye \npruritus, stinging sensation in \nthe eye2, foreign body sensation, \ndry eye, erythema of eyelid, eye \npain, photophobia, eye \ndischarge, visual disturbance2, \neyelid pruritus, visual acuity \nworsened2, blepharitis2, eyelid \noedema, eye irritation, \nlacrimation increased, growth of \neyelashes. \n\n Uncommon iritis2, conjunctival oedema2, \n\n\n\n7 \n\neyelid pain2, abnormal sensation \nin the eye1, asthenopia, \ntrichiasis2, iris \nhyperpigmentation2, deepening \nof eyelid sulcus, eyelid \nretraction2, eyelash \ndiscolouration (darkening)1. \n\n Not known cystoid macular oedema2, eye \nswelling, vision blurred2, ocular \ndiscomfort \n\nCardiac disorders Not known Bradycardia \nVascular disorders Not known Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Rhinitis2 \nUncommon dyspnoea \n\n Not known bronchospasm (predominantly \nin patients with pre-existing \nbronchospastic disease) 2, \nasthma  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nCommon blepharal pigmentation2, \nhirsutism2, skin \nhyperpigmentation (periocular). \n\nNot known Alopecia, skin discolouration \n(periocular) \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nNot known fatigue \n\n1adverse reactions only observed with Ganfort single-dose formulation \n2adverse reactions only observed with Ganfort multi-dose formulation  \n \nLike other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, GANFORT (bimatoprost/timolol) is absorbed into the \nsystemic circulation. Absorption of timolol may cause similar undesirable effects as seen with \nsystemic beta-blocking agents.  The incidence of systemic ADRs after topical ophthalmic \nadministration is lower than for systemic administration. To reduce the systemic absorption, see \nsection 4.2. \n \nAdditional adverse reactions that have been seen with either of the active substances (bimatoprost or \ntimolol), and may potentially occur also with GANFORT are listed below in Table 2: \n \nTable 2 \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders systemic allergic reactions including \n\nanaphylaxis1 \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders hypoglycaemia1 \nPsychiatric disorders depression1, memory loss1, hallucination1 \nNervous system disorders syncope1, cerebrovascular accident1, increase in \n\nsigns and symptoms of myasthenia gravis1, \nparaesthesia1, cerebral ischaemia1 \n\nEye disorders decreased corneal sensitivity1, diplopia1, ptosis1, \nchoroidal detachment following filtration surgery \n(see section 4.4)1, keratitis1, blepharospasm2, \nretinal haemorrhage2, uveitis2,  \n\nCardiac disorder atrioventricular block1, cardiac arrest1, \narrhythmia1, cardiac failure1, congestive heart \nfailure1, chest pain1, palpitations1, oedema1 \n\nVascular disorders hypotension1, Raynaud’s phenomenon1, cold \n\n\n\n8 \n\nhands and feet1 \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Asthma exacerbation2, COPD exacerbation2, \n\ncough1 \nGastrointestinal disorders nausea1,2, diarrhoea1, dyspepsia1, dry mouth1, \n\nabdominal pain1, vomiting1 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders psoriasiform rash1 or exacerbation of psoriasis1, \n\nskin rash1 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders myalgia1  \nReproductive system and breast disorders sexual dysfunction1, decreased libido1 \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nasthenia1,2 \n\nInvestigations liver function tests (LFT) abnormal2 \n1 adverse reactions observed with Timolol  \n2 adverse reactions observed with Bimatoprost  \n \nAdverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops \n \nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA topical overdose with GANFORT is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. \n \nBimatoprost \nIf GANFORT is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat \nand mouse studies, doses of bimatoprost up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose \nexpressed as mg/m2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of GANFORT in \na 10 kg child. \n \nTimolol \nSymptoms of systemic timolol overdose include: bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, headache, \ndizziness, shortness of breath, and cardiac arrest.  A study of patients with renal failure showed that \ntimolol did not dialyse readily. \n \nIf overdose occurs treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmological,– beta-blocking agents – ATC code: S01ED51 \n \nMechanism of action \nGANFORT consists of two active substances: bimatoprost and timolol. These two components \ndecrease elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) by complementary mechanisms of action and the \ncombined effect results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound administered alone. \nGANFORT has a rapid onset of action. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive active substance .  It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally \nrelated to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors.  \nBimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called \nprostamides.  The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.  The \nmechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing \naqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow. \n \nTimolol is a beta1 and beta2 non-selective adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have \nsignificant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anaesthetic \n(membrane-stabilising) activity.  Timolol lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humour formation.  The \nprecise mechanism of action is not clearly established, but inhibition of the increased cyclic AMP \nsynthesis caused by endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation is probable.  \n \nClinical effects \nThe IOP-lowering effect of GANFORT is non-inferior to that achieved by adjunctive therapy of \nbimatoprost (once daily) and timolol (twice daily). \n \nExisting literature data for GANFORT suggest that evening dosing may be more effective in IOP \nlowering than morning dosing. However, consideration should be given to the likelihood of \ncompliance when considering either morning or evening dosing. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of GANFORT in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGANFORT medicinal product \nPlasma bimatoprost and timolol concentrations were determined in a crossover study comparing the \nmonotherapy treatments to GANFORT treatment in healthy subjects.  Systemic absorption of the \nindividual components was minimal and not affected by co-administration in a single formulation. \n \nIn two 12-month studies where systemic absorption was measured, no accumulation was observed \nwith either of the individual components. \n \nBimatoprost \nBimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro.  After ocular administration, the \nsystemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once daily ocular \nadministration of one drop of 0.03% bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks, blood concentrations \npeaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection (0.025 \nng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing.  Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 \nat approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 ng•hr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady drug \nconcentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. \n \nBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in \nhumans at steady-state was 0.67 1/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The \nplasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%. \n \nBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation \nfollowing ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to \nform a diverse variety of metabolites. \n \nBimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered \nto healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The \nelimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the \ntotal blood clearance was 1.5 1/hr/kg. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCharacteristics in older people \nAfter twice daily dosing, the mean AUC 0-24hrs value of 0.0634 ng•hr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly \n(subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng•hr/ml in young healthy adults. \nHowever, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young \nsubjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the \nblood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients. \n \nTimolol \nAfter ocular administration of a 0.5% eye drops solution in humans undergoing cataract surgery, peak \ntimolol concentration was 898 ng/ml in the aqueous humour at one hour post-dose.  Part of the dose is \nabsorbed systemically where it is extensively metabolised in the liver. The half-life of timolol in \nplasma is about 4 to 6 hours.  Timolol is partially metabolised by the liver with timolol and its \nmetabolites excreted by the kidney.  Timolol is not extensively bound to plasma.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGANFORT medicinal product \nRepeated dose ocular toxicity studies on GANFORT showed no special hazard for humans. The ocular \nand systemic safety profile of the individual components is well established. \n \nBimatoprost \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Studies in rodents produced species-specific \nabortion at systemic exposure levels 33- to 97-times that achieved in humans after ocular \nadministration.  \n \nMonkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥0.03% daily for 1 year had an increase \nin iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper \nand/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris pigmentation appears to \nbe caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in \nmelanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been \nobserved, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown. \n \nTimolol \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGANFORT 0.3 mg/ml + 5 mg/ml eye drops, solution, in single-dose container. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 0.3 mg of bimatoprost and 5 mg of timolol (as 6.8 mg of timolol maleate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution, in single-dose container. \n \nColourless to slightly yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \nhypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nRecommended dosage in adults (including older people) \nThe recommended dose is one drop of GANFORT single-dose in the affected eye(s) once daily, \nadministered either in the morning or in the evening.  It should be administered at the same time each \nday. \n \nExisting literature data for GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) suggest that evening dosing may be \nmore effective in IOP lowering than morning dosing. However, consideration should be given to the \nlikelihood of compliance when considering either morning or evening dosing (see section 5.1). \n \nThe single-dose container is for single use only; one container is sufficient to treat both eyes.  Any \nunused solution should be discarded immediately after use.  If one dose is missed, treatment should \ncontinue with the next dose as planned.  The dose should not exceed one drop in the affected eye(s) \ndaily. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nGANFORT single-dose has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Therefore \ncaution should be used in treating such patients.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of GANFORT single-dose in children aged less than 18 years has not been \nestablished.  No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is to be used, each one should be instilled at \nleast 5 minutes apart. \n \nWhen using nasolacrimal occlusion or closing the eyelids for 2 minutes, the systemic absorption is \nreduced. This may result in a decrease in systemic side effects and an increase in local activity. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, severe \n\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, second or third degree atrioventricular \n\nblock, not controlled with pace-maker.  Overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLike other topically applied ophthalmic medicinal products, the active substances (timolol/ \nbimatoprost) in GANFORT single-dose may be absorbed systemically.  No enhancement of the \nsystemic absorption of the individual active substances has been observed with GANFORT \n(multi-dose formulation).  Due to the beta-adrenergic component, timolol, the same types of \ncardiovascular, pulmonary and other adverse reactions (ADRs) as seen with systemic beta-blockers \nmay occur. Incidence of systemic ADRs after topical ophthalmic administration is lower than for \nsystemic administration.  To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPatients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease, Prinzmetal's angina and cardiac \nfailure) and receiving hypotension therapy with beta-blockers should be critically assessed and therapy \nwith other active substances should be considered. Patients with cardiovascular diseases should be \nwatched for signs of deterioration of these diseases and of adverse reactions. \n\nDue to the negative effect on conduction time, beta-blockers should only be given with caution to \npatients with first degree heart block. \n\nVascular disorders \nPatients with severe peripheral circulatory disturbance/disorders (i.e. severe forms of Raynaud’s \ndisease or Raynaud’s syndrome) should be treated with caution. \n \nRespiratory disorders: \nRespiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, have been \nreported following administration of some ophthalmic beta-blockers. \n \nGANFORT single-dose should be used with caution in patients with mild/moderate chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nEndocrine disorders: \nBeta-adrenergic blocking medicinal products should be administered with caution in patients subject \nto spontaneous hypoglycaemia or in patients with labile diabetes as beta-blockers may mask the signs \nand symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. \n \nBeta-blockers may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. \n \nCorneal diseases \nOphthalmic beta-blockers may induce dryness of eyes.  Patients with corneal diseases should be \ntreated with caution. \n \nOther beta-blocking agents \nThe effect on intra-ocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta-blockade may be potentiated \nwhen timolol is given to patients already receiving a systemic beta-blocking agent.  The response of \nthese patients should be closely observed.  The use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAnaphylactic reactions \nWhile taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction \nto a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge with such allergens and \nunresponsive to the usual dose of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions. \n \nChoroidal detachment \nChoroidal detachment has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g. \ntimolol, acetazolamide) after filtration procedures. \n \nSurgical anaesthesia \nBeta-blocking ophthalmological preparations may block systemic beta-agonist effects e.g. of \nadrenaline.  The anaesthesiologist should be informed when the patient is receiving timolol. \n \nHepatic \nIn patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at baseline, bimatoprost eye drops had no adverse reactions \non liver function over 24 months.  There are no known adverse reactions of ocular timolol on liver \nfunction. \n \nOcular  \nBefore treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth, and \nperiorbital skin hyperpigmentation since these have been observed during treatment with GANFORT \nsingle-dose.  Increased brown iris pigmentation has also been observed during treatment with \nGANFORT (multi-dose formulation).  Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent, and may \nlead to differences in appearance between the eyes if only one eye is treated. After discontinuation of \nGANFORT, pigmentation of iris may be permanent.  After 12 months of treatment with GANFORT \n(multi-dose formulation), the incidence of iris pigmentation was 0.2%. After 12 months of treatment \nwith bimatoprost eye drops alone, the incidence was 1.5% and did not increase following 3 years of \ntreatment. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than \nto an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iridial pigmentation \nare not known.  Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be \nnoticeable for several months to years. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by \ntreatment. Periorbital tissue pigmentation has been reported to be reversible in some patients. \n \nMacular oedema, including cystoid macular oedema has been reported with GANFORT (multi-dose \nformulation).  Therefore, GANFORT single-dose should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in \npseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for \nmacular oedema (e.g. intraocular surgery, retinal vein occlusions, ocular inflammatory disease and \ndiabetic retinopathy).   \nGANFORT should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g. uveitis) \nbecause the inflammation may be exacerbated. \n \nSkin  \nThere is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where GANFORT solution comes repeatedly in \ncontact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply GANFORT as instructed and avoid it \nrunning onto the cheek or other skin areas.  \n \nOther conditions \nGANFORT single-dose has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, \nneovascular, inflammatory, angle-closure, congenital or narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nIn studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been \nshown that more frequent exposure of the eye to more than 1 dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease \nthe IOP-lowering effect. Patients using GANFORT with other prostaglandin analogues should be \nmonitored for changes to their intraocular pressure. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with the bimatoprost / timolol fixed combination. \n \nThere is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension, and/or marked bradycardia when \nophthalmic beta-blocker solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, \nguanethidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, parasympathomimetics, anti-arrhythmics (including \namiodarone) and digitalis glycosides.  \n \nPotentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g. decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during \ncombined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and timolol. \n \nMydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta-blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) \nhas been reported occasionally. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of the bimatoprost / timolol fixed combination in pregnant \nwomen.  GANFORT single-dose should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. To \nreduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n \nBimatoprost \nNo adequate clinical data in exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies have shown \nreproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \n \nTimolol  \nEpidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but have shown a risk for intra uterine \ngrowth retardation when beta-blockers are administered by the oral route.  In addition, signs and \nsymptoms of beta-blockade (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia) \nhave been observed in the neonate when beta-blockers have been administered until delivery.  If \nGANFORT single-dose is administered until delivery, the neonate should be carefully monitored \nduring the first days of life.  Animal studies with timolol have shown reproductive toxicity at doses \nsignificantly higher than would be used in clinical practice (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nTimolol  \nBeta-blockers are excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of timolol in eye drops it is \nnot likely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk to produce clinical symptoms of \nbeta-blockade in the infant.  To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n \nBimatoprost \nIt is not known if bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk but it is excreted in the milk of the \nlactating rat. GANFORT single-dose should not be used by breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of GANFORT single-dose on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGANFORT single-dose has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any \ntopical ocular treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until \nthe vision clears before driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGANFORT single-dose \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reactions reported in the clinical study using GANFORT single-dose were limited to \nthose earlier reported for either GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) or for the single active \nsubstances bimatoprost or timolol.  No new adverse reactions specific for GANFORT single-dose \nhave been observed in clinical studies.  \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions reported with GANFORT single-dose were ocular, mild in severity \nand none were serious.  Based on a 12-week study of GANFORT single-dose administered once daily, \nthe most commonly reported adverse reaction with GANFORT single-dose was conjunctival \nhyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature) in approximately \n21% of patients and led to discontinuation in 1.4% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 presents the adverse reactions that were reported during clinical studies of both GANFORT \nsingle-dose and Ganfort multi-dose formulations (within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness) or in the post-marketing period. \n \nThe frequency of possible adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nVery common ≥1/10 \nCommon ≥1/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon ≥1/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare <1/10,000 \nNot known Frequency cannot be estimated from available data \n \nTable 1 \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Not known hypersensitivity reactions \n\nincluding signs or symptoms of \nallergic dermatitis, angioedema, \neye allergy \n\nPsychiatric disorders Not known Insomnia2, nightmare2 \nNervous system disorders \n \n\nCommon headache \nNot known Dysgeusia2, dizziness \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nVery common conjunctival hyperaemia. \nCommon punctuate keratitis, corneal \n\nerosion2, burning sensation2, \nconjunctival irritation1, eye \npruritus, stinging sensation in \nthe eye2, foreign body sensation, \ndry eye, erythema of eyelid, eye \npain, photophobia, eye \ndischarge, visual disturbance2, \neyelid pruritus, visual acuity \nworsened2, blepharitis2, eyelid \noedema, eye irritation, \nlacrimation increased, growth of \neyelashes. \n\n Uncommon iritis2, conjunctival oedema2, \neyelid pain2, abnormal sensation \nin the eye1, asthenopia, \ntrichiasis2, iris \nhyperpigmentation2, deepening \nof eyelid sulcus, eyelid \n\n\n\n17 \n\nretraction2, eyelash \ndiscolouration (darkening)1. \n\n Not known cystoid macular oedema2, eye \nswelling, vision blurred2, ocular \ndiscomfort \n\nCardiac disorders Not known Bradycardia \nVascular disorders Not known Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Rhinitis2 \nUncommon dyspnoea \nNot known bronchospasm (predominantly \n\nin patients with pre-existing \nbronchospastic disease) 2, \nasthma  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nCommon blepharal pigmentation2, \nhirsutism2, skin \nhyperpigmentation (periocular). \n\nNot known Alopecia, skin discolouration \n(periocular) \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nNot known fatigue \n\n1adverse reactions only observed with Ganfort single-dose formulation \n2adverse reactions only observed with Ganfort multi-dose formulation  \n \nLike other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, GANFORT (bimatoprost/timolol) is absorbed into the \nsystemic circulation. Absorption of timolol may cause similar undesirable effects as seen with \nsystemic beta-blocking agents.  The incidence of systemic ADRs after topical ophthalmic \nadministration is lower than for systemic administration. To reduce the systemic absorption, see \nsection 4.2. \n \nAdditional adverse reactions that have been seen with either of the active substances (bimatoprost or \ntimolol), and may potentially occur also with GANFORT are listed below in Table 2: \n \nTable 2 \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders systemic allergic reactions including \n\nanaphylaxis1 \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders hypoglycaemia1 \nPsychiatric disorders depression1, memory loss1, hallucination 1 \nNervous system disorders syncope1, cerebrovascular accident1, increase in \n\nsigns and symptoms of myasthenia gravis1, \nparaesthesia1, cerebral ischaemia1 \n\nEye disorders decreased corneal sensitivity1, diplopia1, ptosis1, \nchoroidal detachment following filtration surgery \n(see section 4.4)1, keratitis1, blepharospasm2, \nretinal haemorrhage2, uveitis2,  \n\nCardiac disorder atrioventricular block1, cardiac arrest1, \narrhythmia1, cardiac failure1, congestive heart \nfailure1, chest pain1, palpitations1, oedema1 \n\nVascular disorders hypotension1, Raynaud’s phenomenon1, cold \nhands and feet1 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Asthma exacerbation2, COPD exacerbation2, \ncough1 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders nausea1,2, diarrhoea1, dyspepsia1, dry mouth1, \nabdominal pain1, vomiting1 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders psoriasiform rash1 or exacerbation of psoriasis1, \n\n\n\n18 \n\nskin rash1 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders myalgia1  \nReproductive system and breast disorders sexual dysfunction1, decreased libido1 \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nasthenia1,2 \n\nInvestigations liver function tests (LFT) abnormal2 \n1 adverse reactions observed with Timolol  \n2 adverse reactions observed with Bimatoprost  \n \nAdverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops \n \nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA topical overdose with GANFORT single-dose is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. \n \nBimatoprost \n \nIf GANFORT single-dose is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful:  in \n2-week oral mice and rats studies, doses of bimatoprost up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any \ntoxicity; this corresponds to a human equivalent dose of 8.1 and 16.2 mg/kg, respectively.  These \ndoses are at least 7.5 times higher than the amount of bimatoprost in an accidental dose of the entire \ncontents of a carton of GANFORT single-dose (90 single-dose containers x 0.4 mL; 36 mL) in a 10 kg \nchild [(36 mL*0.3 mg/mL bimatoprost)/10 kg; 1.08 mg/kg].   \n \nTimolol \n \nSymptoms of systemic timolol overdose include: bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, headache, \ndizziness, shortness of breath, and cardiac arrest.  A study of patients with renal failure showed that \ntimolol did not dialyse readily. \n \nIf overdose occurs treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Ophthalmological, beta-blocking agents – ATC code:  S01ED51. \n \nMechanism of action \nGANFORT single-dose consists of two active substances: bimatoprost and timolol.  These two \ncomponents decrease elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) by complementary mechanisms of action and \nthe combined effect results in additional IOP reduction compared to either compound administered \nalone.  GANFORT single-dose has a rapid onset of action. \n \nBimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive active substance.  It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally \nrelated to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors.  \n\n\n\n19 \n\nBimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called \nprostamides.  The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.  The \nmechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing \naqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow. \n \nTimolol is a beta1 and beta2 non-selective adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have \nsignificant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anaesthetic \n(membrane-stabilising) activity.  Timolol lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humour formation.  The \nprecise mechanism of action is not clearly established, but inhibition of the increased cyclic AMP \nsynthesis caused by endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation is probable.  \n \nClinical effects \nA 12-week (double-masked, randomized, parallel group) clinical study compared the efficacy and \nsafety of GANFORT single-dose with GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) in patients with glaucoma \nor ocular hypertension.  GANFORT single-dose achieved noninferior IOP-lowering efficacy to \nGANFORT (multi-dose formulation):  the upper limit of the 95% CI of the between-treatment \ndifference was within the pre-defined 1.5 mm Hg margin at each timepoint evaluated (hours 0, 2, and \n8) at week 12 (for the primary analysis), and also at weeks 2 and 6, for mean worse eye IOP change \nfrom baseline (worse eye IOP refers to the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP at baseline).  In fact, \nthe upper limit of the 95% CI did not exceed 0.14 mm Hg at week 12.     \n \nBoth treatment groups showed statistically and clinically significant mean decreases from baseline in \nworse eye IOP at all follow up timepoints throughout the study (p < 0.001).  Mean changes from \nbaseline worse eye IOP ranged from -9.16 to -7.98 mm Hg for GANFORT (single-dose) group, and \nfrom -9.03 to -7.72 mm Hg for the GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) group across the 12-week \nstudy. \n \nGANFORT single-dose also achieved equivalent IOP-lowering efficacy to GANFORT (multi-dose \nformulation) in average eye and worse eye IOP at each follow-up timepoint at weeks 2, 6 and 12. \n \nBased on studies of GANFORT (multi-dose formulation), the IOP-lowering effect of GANFORT is \nnon-inferior to that achieved by adjunctive therapy of bimatoprost (once daily) and timolol (twice \ndaily).  \n \nExisting literature data for GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) suggest that evening dosing may be \nmore effective in IOP lowering than morning dosing.  However, consideration should be given to the \nlikelihood of compliance when considering either morning or evening dosing. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of GANFORT single-dose in children aged less than 18 years has not been \nestablished. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGANFORT medicinal product \nPlasma bimatoprost and timolol concentrations were determined in a crossover study comparing the \nmonotherapy treatments to GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) treatment in healthy subjects.  \nSystemic absorption of the individual components was minimal and not affected by co-administration \nin a single formulation. \n \nIn two 12-month studies of GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) in which systemic absorption was \nmeasured, no accumulation was observed of either of the individual components. \n \nBimatoprost \nBimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro.  After ocular administration, the \nsystemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once daily ocular \n\n\n\n20 \n\nadministration of one drop of 0.03% bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks, blood concentrations \npeaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection \n(0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing.  Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 \nand 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 ng•hr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady drug \nconcentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing. \n \nBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in \nhumans at steady-state was 0.67 1/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma.  The \nplasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%. \n \nBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation \nfollowing ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to \nform a diverse variety of metabolites. \n \nBimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered \nto healthy volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces.  The \nelimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the \ntotal blood clearance was 1.5 1/hr/kg. \n \nCharacteristics in older people \nAfter twice daily dosing of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml, the mean AUC 0-24hrs value of 0.0634 ng•hr/ml \nbimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng•hr/ml \nin young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both \nelderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of \nbimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients. \n \nTimolol \nAfter ocular administration of a 0.5% eye drops solution in humans undergoing cataract surgery, peak \ntimolol concentration was 898 ng/ml in the aqueous humour at one hour post-dose.  Part of the dose is \nabsorbed systemically where it is extensively metabolised in the liver. The half-life of timolol in \nplasma is about 4 to 6 hours.  Timolol is partially metabolised by the liver with timolol and its \nmetabolites excreted by the kidney.  Timolol is not extensively bound to plasma.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGANFORT medicinal product \nRepeated dose ocular toxicity studies of GANFORT (multi-dose formulation) showed no special \nhazard for humans. The ocular and systemic safety profile of the individual components is well \nestablished. \n \nBimatoprost \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Studies in rodents produced species-specific \nabortion at systemic exposure levels 33- to 97-times that achieved in humans after ocular \nadministration.  \n \nMonkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of ≥0.03% daily for 1 year had an increase \nin iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper \nand/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris pigmentation appears to \nbe caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in \nmelanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been \nobserved, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTimolol \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.  \n \n \n6.

This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What GANFORT is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use GANFORT \n3. How to use GANFORT \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store GANFORT \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What GANFORT is and what it is used for \n \nGANFORT contains two different active substances (bimatoprost and timolol) that both reduce \npressure in the eye. Bimatoprost belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides, a prostaglandin \nanalogue. Timolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers.    \n \nYour eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being \ndrained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly \nenough, the pressure inside the eye builds up and could eventually damage your sight (an illness called \nglaucoma). GANFORT works by reducing the production of liquid and also increasing the amount of \nliquid that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. \n  \nGANFORT eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye in adults, including the elderly. This \nhigh pressure can lead to glaucoma. Your doctor will prescribe you GANFORT when other eye drops \ncontaining beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues  have not worked sufficiently on their own. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GANFORT \n \nDo not use GANFORT eye drops, solution \n \n- if you are allergic to bimatoprost, timolol, beta-blockers or any of the other ingredients of \n\nGANFORT (listed in section 6) \n- if you have now or have had in past respiratory problems such as asthma, severe chronic \n\nobstructive bronchitis (severe lung disease which may cause wheeziness, difficulty in breathing \nand/ or long-standing cough)  \n\n- if you have heart problems such as low heart rate, heart block, or heart failure  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBefore you use this medicine, tell your doctor if you have now or have had in the past \n \n- coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or \n\nchoking), heart failure, low blood pressure,  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n- disturbances of heart rate such as slow heart beat  \n- breathing problems, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n- poor blood circulation disease (such as Raynaud’s disease or Raynaud’s syndrome) \n-    overactivity of the thyroid gland as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of  \n       thyroid disease \n-     diabetes as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of low blood sugar  \n-     severe allergic reactions \n-   liver or kidney problems \n-  eye surface problems \n-  separation of one of the layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye \n-  known risk factors for macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to \n\nworsening vision), for example, cataract surgery \n \nTell your doctor before surgical anaesthesia that you are using GANFORT as timolol may change \neffects of some medicines used during anaesthesia. \nGANFORT may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to \ndarken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker over time.  These changes may be permanent. \nThe change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye. GANFORT may cause hair \ngrowth when in contact with the skin surface. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nGANFORT should not be used in children and teenagers under 18.  \n \nOther medicines and GANFORT \nGANFORT can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for \nthe treatment of glaucoma. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken \nor might take any other medicines. Tell your doctor if you are using or intend to use medicines to \nlower blood pressure, heart medicine, medicines to treat diabetes, quinidine (used to treat heart \nconditions and some types of malaria) or medicines to treat depression known as fluoxetine and \nparoxetine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use GANFORT if you are \npregnant unless your doctor still recommends it. \n \nDo not use GANFORT if you are breast-feeding. Timolol may get into your breast milk. \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nGANFORT may cause blurred vision in some patients. Do not drive or use machines until the \nsymptoms have cleared. \n \nGANFORT contains Benzalkonium chloride \nGanfort contains a preservative called benzalkonium chloride.  \nThis medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to \n0.05 mg/ml.  \nBenzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the \ncontact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15 \nminutes afterwards. \nBenzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of \nthe cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain \nin the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n \n \n3. How to use GANFORT \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nAlways use GANFORT exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe usual dose is one drop once a day, either in the morning or in the evening in each eye that needs \ntreatment.  Use at the same time each day. \n \nInstructions for use \nYou must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it. \n \n \n\n5. \n\n \n \n1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. \n2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket. \n3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment. \n4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye. \n5. Whilst keeping the eye closed, press your finger against the corner of the closed eye (the site where \nthe eye meets the nose) and hold for 2 minutes. This helps to stop GANFORT getting into the rest of \nthe body. \n \nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n \nTo avoid contamination, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or anything else. Put the cap \nback on and close the bottle straight after you have used it. \n \nIf you use GANFORT with another eye medicine, leave at least 5 minutes between putting in \nGANFORT and the other medicine. Use any eye ointment or eye gel last. \n \nIf you use more GANFORT than you should \nIf you use more GANFORT than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your \nnext dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to use GANFORT \nIf you forget to use GANFORT, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your \nregular routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using GANFORT \nGANFORT should be used every day to work properly. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nLike all medicines, GANFORT can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  You can \nusually carry on taking the drops, unless the effects are serious. If you’re worried, talk to a doctor or \npharmacist. Do not stop using Ganfort without speaking to your doctor.  \n \nThe following side effects may be seen with GANFORT (multi-dose and/or single-dose):  \n \nVery common side effects \nThese may affect more than 1 user in 10 \nAffecting the eye \nredness. \n \nCommon side effects \nThese may affect 1 to 9 users in 100 \nAffecting the eye \nburning, itching, stinging, irritation of the conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), sensitivity to \nlight, eye pain, sticky eyes, dry eyes, a feeling of something in the eye, small breaks in the surface of \nthe eye with or without inflammation, difficulty in seeing clearly, redness and itching of the eyelids, \nhair growing around the eye, darkening of the eyelids, darker skin colour around the eyes, longer \neyelashes, eye irritation, watery eyes, swollen eyelids, reduced vision.  \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \nrunny nose, headache. \n \nUncommon side effects \nThese may affect 1 to 9 users in 1,000 \nAffecting the eye \nabnormal sensation in the eye, iris inflammation, swollen conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), \npainful eyelids, tired eyes, in-growing eyelashes, darkening of iris colour, eyes appear sunken, eyelid \nhas moved away from the surface of the eye, darkening of eyelashes.  \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \nshortness of breath. \n \nSide effects where the frequency is not known  \nAffecting the eye \ncystoid macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening vision), eye \nswelling, blurred vision, ocular discomfort. \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \ndifficulty breathing / wheezing, symptoms of allergic reaction (swelling, redness of the eye and rash of \nthe skin), changes in your taste sensation, dizziness, slowing of heart rate, high blood pressure, \ndifficulty sleeping, nightmare, asthma, hair loss, skin discolouration (periocular), tiredness. \n  \n \nAdditional side effects have been seen in patients using eye drops containing timolol or bimatoprost \nand so may possibly be seen with GANFORT. Like other medicines applied into eyes, timolol is \nabsorbed into the blood. This may cause similar side effects as seen with ”intravenous” and /or “oral” \nbeta-blocking agents. The chance of having side effects after using eye drops is lower than when \nmedicines are for example, taken by mouth or injected. Listed side effects include reactions seen \nwithin bimatoprost and timolol when used for treating eye conditions: \n\n• Severe allergic reactions with swelling and difficulty breathing which could be life-threatening  \n• Low blood sugar \n• Depression; memory loss; hallucination \n• Fainting; stroke; decreased blood flow to the brain; worsening of myasthenia gravis (increased \n\nmuscle weakness); tingling sensation \n\n\n\n47 \n\n• Decreased sensation of your eye surface; double vision; drooping eyelid; separation of one of \nthe layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye; inflammation of \nthe surface of the eye, bleeding in the back of the eye (retinal bleeding), inflammation within \nthe eye, increased blinking \n\n• Heart failure; irregularity or stopping of the heartbeat; slow or fast heartbeat; too much fluid, \nmainly water, accumulating in the body; chest pain \n\n• Low blood pressure, swelling or coldness of your hands, feet and extremities, caused by \nconstriction of your blood vessels \n\n• Cough, worsening of asthma, worsening of the lung disease called chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD)  \n\n• Diarrhoea; stomach pain; feeling and being sick; indigestion; dry mouth \n• Red scaly patches on skin; skin rash \n• Muscle pain \n• Reduced sexual urge; sexual dysfunction \n• Weakness \n• An increase in blood test results that show how your liver is working  \n\n \n \nOther side effects reported with eye drops containing phosphates \nThis medicine contains 2.85 mg phosphates in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 0.95 \nmg/ml. If you suffer from severe damage to the clear layer at the front of the eye (the cornea), \nphosphates may cause in very rare cases cloudy patches on the cornea due to calcium build-up during \ntreatment.  \n \nReporting side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V*. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.  How to store GANFORT \n \nKeep GANFORT out of the sight and reach of children.  \n \nDo not use GANFORT after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle label and the carton after \nEXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nOnce opened, solutions may become contaminated, which can cause eye infections. Therefore, you \nmust throw away the bottle 4 weeks after you first opened it, even if some solution is left. To help you \nremember, write down the date that you opened it in the space on the carton. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

What you need to know before you use GANFORT single-dose \n3. How to use GANFORT single-dose \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store GANFORT single-dose \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What GANFORT single-dose is and what it is used for \n \nGANFORT single-dose contains two different active substances (bimatoprost and timolol) that both \nreduce pressure in the eye. Bimatoprost belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides, a \nprostaglandin analogue.  Timolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers.    \n \nYour eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye.  Liquid is constantly being \ndrained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this.  If the liquid cannot drain out quickly \nenough, the pressure inside the eye builds up and could eventually damage your sight (an illness called \nglaucoma). GANFORT single-dose works by reducing the production of liquid and also increasing the \namount of liquid that is drained.  This reduces the pressure inside the eye. \n  \nGANFORT single-dose eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye in adults, including the \nelderly.  This high pressure can lead to glaucoma.  Your doctor will prescribe you GANFORT \nsingle-dose when other eye drops containing beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues have not \nworked sufficiently on their own. \n \nThis medicine does not contain a preservative. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use GANFORT single-dose \n \nDo not use GANFORT single-dose eye drops, solution \n \n- if you are allergic to bimatoprost, timolol, beta-blockers or any of the other ingredients of \n\nGANFORT single-dose (listed in section 6) \n- if you have now or have had in past respiratory problems such as asthma, severe chronic \n\nobstructive bronchitis (severe lung disease which may cause wheeziness, difficulty in breathing \nand/ or long-standing cough)  \n\n- if you have heart problems such as low heart rate, heart block, or heart failure  \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nBefore you use this medicine, tell your doctor if you have now or have had in the past \n \n- coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or choking), \n\nheart failure, low blood pressure  \n- disturbances of heart rate such as slow heart beat  \n- breathing problems, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n- poor blood circulation disease (such as Raynaud’s disease or Raynaud’s syndrome) \n- overactivity of the thyroid gland as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of thyroid disease \n- diabetes as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of low blood sugar \n- severe allergic reaction \n- liver or kidney problems \n- eye surface problems \n- separation of one of the layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye \n- known risk factors for macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening \n\nvision), for example, cataract surgery \n \nTell your doctor before surgical anaesthesia that you are using GANFORT single-dose as timolol may \nchange effects of some medicines used during anaesthesia. \n \nGANFORT single-dose may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the \neye to darken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker over time.  These changes may be \npermanent. The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye. GANFORT single-\ndose may cause hair growth when in contact with the skin surface.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nGANFORT single-dose should not be used in children and teenagers under 18.  \n \nOther medicines and GANFORT single-dose \nGANFORT single-dose can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye \ndrops for the treatment of glaucoma.  Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have \nrecently taken or might take any other medicines.  Tell your doctor if you are using or intend to use \nmedicines to lower blood pressure, heart medicine, medicines to treat diabetes, quinidine (used to treat \nheart conditions and some types of malaria) or medicines to treat depression known as fluoxetine and \nparoxetine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  Do not use GANFORT single-dose \nif you are pregnant unless your doctor still recommends it. \n \nDo not use GANFORT single-dose if you are breast-feeding. Timolol may get into your breast milk. \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nGANFORT single-dose may cause blurred vision in some patients. Do not drive or use machines until \nthe symptoms have cleared. \n \n \n3. How to use GANFORT single-dose \n \nAlways use GANFORT single-dose exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with \nyour doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe usual dose is one drop once a day, either in the morning or in the evening in each eye that needs \ntreatment.  Use at the same time each day. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nInstructions for use \nWash your hands before use. Make sure that the single-dose container is intact before use. The \nsolution should be used immediately after opening. To avoid contamination, do not let the open-end of \nthe single-dose container touch your eye or anything else. \n \n\n \n \n1.  Tear 1 single-dose container from the strip. \n2.  Hold the single-dose container upright (with the cap pointing upwards) and twist off the cap. \n3.  Gently pull down the lower eyelid to form a pocket. Turn the single-dose container upside \n\ndown and squeeze it to release 1 drop into the affected eye(s).  \n4.  Whilst keeping the eye closed, press your finger against the corner of the closed eye (the site \n\nwhere the eye meets the nose) and hold for 2 minutes. This helps to stop GANFORT \nsingle-dose getting into the rest of the body. \n\n5.  Throw away the single-dose container after you have used it, even if there is some solution \nleft. \n\n \nIf a drop misses your eye, try again.  Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek. \n \nIf you wear contact lenses, take your lenses out before using this medicine.  Wait 15 minutes after \nusing the drops, and before you put your lenses back in. \n\nIf you use GANFORT single-dose with another eye medicine, leave at least 5 minutes between putting \nin GANFORT single-dose and the other medicine. Use any eye ointment or eye gel last. \n \nIf you use more GANFORT single-dose than you should \nIf you use more GANFORT single-dose than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. \nPut your next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to use GANFORT single-dose \nIf you forget to use GANFORT single-dose, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go \nback to your regular routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using GANFORT single-dose \nGANFORT single-dose should be used every day to work properly. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, GANFORT single-dose can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \nYou can usually carry on taking the drops, unless the effects are serious. If you’re worried, talk to a \ndoctor or pharmacist. Do not stop using GANFORT single-dose without speaking to your doctor.  \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nThe following side effects may be seen with GANFORT (single-dose and/or multi-dose):  \n \nVery common side effects \nThese may affect more than 1 user in 10 \nAffecting the eye \nredness. \n \nCommon side effects \nThese may affect 1 to 9 users in 100 \nAffecting the eye \nburning, itching, stinging, irritation of the conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), sensitivity to \nlight, eye pain, sticky eyes, dry eyes, a feeling of something in the eye, small breaks in the surface of \nthe eye with or without inflammation, difficulty in seeing clearly, redness and itching of the eyelids, \nhair growing around the eye, darkening of the eyelids, darker skin colour around the eyes, longer \neyelashes, eye irritation, watery eyes, swollen eyelids, reduced vision.  \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \nrunny nose, headache. \n \nUncommon side effects \nThese may affect 1 to 9 users in 1,000 \nAffecting the eye \nabnormal sensation in the eye, iris inflammation, swollen conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), \npainful eyelids, tired eyes, in-growing eyelashes, darkening of iris colour, eyes appear sunken, eyelid \nhas moved away from the surface of the eye, darkening of eyelashes.  \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \nshortness of breath. \n \nSide effects where the frequency is not known  \nAffecting the eye \ncystoid macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening vision), eye \nswelling, blurred vision, ocular discomfort. \n \nAffecting other parts of the body \ndifficulty breathing / wheezing, symptoms of allergic reaction (swelling, redness of the eye and rash of \nthe skin), changes in your taste sensation, dizziness, slowing of heart rate, high blood pressure, \ndifficulty sleeping, nightmare, asthma, hair loss, skin discolouration (periocular), tiredness. \n \n \nAdditional side effects have been seen in patients using eye drops containing timolol or bimatoprost \nand so may possibly be seen with GANFORT.

Listed side effects include reactions seen \nwithin bimatoprost and timolol when used for treating eye conditions: \n\n• Severe allergic reactions with swelling and difficulty breathing which could be life-threatening  \n• Low blood sugar \n• Depression; memory loss; hallucination \n• Fainting; stroke; decreased blood flow to the brain; worsening of myasthenia gravis (increased \n\nmuscle weakness); tingling sensation \n• Decreased sensation of your eye surface; double vision; drooping eyelid; separation of one of \n\nthe layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye; inflammation of \nthe surface of the eye, bleeding in the back of the eye (retinal bleeding), inflammation within \nthe eye, increased blinking \n\n\n\n54 \n\n• Heart failure; irregularity or stopping of the heartbeat; slow or fast heartbeat; too much fluid, \nmainly water, accumulating in the body; chest pain \n\n• Low blood pressure, swelling or coldness of your hands, feet and extremities, caused by \nconstriction of your blood vessels \n\n• Cough, worsening of asthma, worsening of the lung disease called chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD)  \n\n• Diarrhoea; stomach pain; feeling and being sick; indigestion; dry mouth \n• Red scaly patches on skin; skin rash \n• Muscle pain \n• Reduced sexual urge; sexual dysfunction \n• Weakness \n• An increase in blood test results that show how your liver is working  \n\n \nOther side effects reported with eye drops containing phosphates \nThis medicine contains 0.38 mg phosphates in each 0.4 ml of solution which is equivalent to 0.95 \nmg/ml. If you suffer from severe damage to the clear layer at the front of the eye (the cornea), \nphosphates may cause in very rare cases cloudy patches on the cornea due to calcium build-up during \ntreatment.  \n \nReporting side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.  This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V*. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
