Only limited experience is \n\navailable of use of intravenous immunoglobulins in children with CIDP.\n– Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nReplacement therapy should be commenced and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency.\n\nPosology\nThe dose and dose regimen is dependent on the indication.\nIn replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualised for each patient depending on the \nclinical response. The following dose regimens are given as a guideline.\n\nReplacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency (PID) syndromes\nThe dose regimen should achieve a trough IgG level (measured before the next infusion) of at least 5\nto 6 g/l. Three to six months are required after the initiation of therapy for equilibration to occur. The \nrecommended starting dose is 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg body weight (bw) given once, followed by at least \n0.2 g/kg bw every 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nThe dose required to achieve a trough level of 5 to 6 g/l is of the order of 0.2 to 0.8 g/kg bw/month. \nThe dosage interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3 to 4 weeks.\nTrough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the patient’s clinical response. \nDepending on the clinical response (e.g. infection rate), adjustment of the dose and/or the dose interval \nmay be considered in order to aim for higher trough levels.\n\nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1)\nThe recommended dose is 0.2 – 0.4 g/kg every three to four weeks.\n\nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. \nDose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase may \nbe necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the patient \nremains infection free.\n\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)\nThere are two alternative treatment schedules:\n 0.8 to 1g/kg bw given on day 1; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days\n 0.4 g/kg bw given daily for 2 to 5 days.\nThe treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome\n0.4 g/kg bw/day over 5 days.\n\nKawasaki disease\n1.6 to 2.0 g/kg bw should be administered in divided doses over 2 to 5 days or 2.0 g/kg bw as a single \ndose.\nPatients should receive concomitant treatment with acetylsalicylic acid.\n\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)*\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 g/kg bw divided over 2 to 5 consecutive days followed by \nmaintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw over 1 to 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks.\n\n\n\n4\n\nMultifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)\nStarting dose: 2 g/kg given over 2-5 consecutive days.\nMaintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks.\nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle. If insufficient treatment effect is seen after 6 \nmonths, the treatment should be discontinued.\nIf the treatment is effective, long term treatment should be subject to the physician’s discretion based \nupon the patient response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted according to the \nindividual course of the disease.\n\nThe dosage recommendations are summarised in the following table:\n\nIndication Dose Frequency of injections\n\nReplacement therapy\n\nPrimary immunodeficiency syndromes \n(PID)\n\nstarting dose:\n0.4 - 0.8 g/kg bw\n\nmaintenance dose:\n\n0.2 - 0.8 g/kg bw\n\nevery 3 to 4 weeks to obtain IgG \ntrough levels of at least 5 - 6 g/l\n\nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as \ndefined in 4.1)\n\n0.2 - 0.4 g/kg bw every 3 to 4 weeks \n\nImmunomodulation\n\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) 0.8 - 1 g/kg bw\n\nor\n\non day 1, possibly repeated once \nwithin 3 days\n\n0.4 g/kg bw/d for 2 to 5 days\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome 0.4 g/kg bw/d for 5 days\n\nKawasaki disease 1.6 – 2 g/kg bw\n\nor\n\nin divided doses over 2 to 5 days in \nassociation with acetylsalicylic acid\n\n2 g/kg bw in one dose in association with \nacetylsalicylic acid\n\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyneuropathy (CIDP)*\n\nstarting dose:\n2 g/kg bw\n\nin divided doses over 2 to 5 days\n\nmaintenance dose: \n1 g/kg bw\n\nevery 3 weeks over 1 to 2 days\n\nMultifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) starting dose : \n2 g/kg bw\n\nover 2 to 5 consecutive days\n\nmaintenance dose:\n\n1 g/kg bw\n\nor\n\nevery 2 to 4 weeks\n\nor\n\n2 g/kg bw every 4 to 8 weeks over 2 to 5 days\n\n*The dose is based on the dose used in the clinical studies conducted with Privigen. The duration of \ntreatment beyond 25 weeks should be subject to the physician’s discretion based upon the patient \nresponse and maintenance response in the long-term. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted \naccording to the individual course of the disease.\n\nPaediatric population\n\n\n\n5\n\nThe posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different from that of adults as the \nposology for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the above \nmentioned conditions.\n\nMethod of administration\nFor intravenous use.\nPrivigen should be infused intravenously at an initial infusion rate of 0.3 ml/kg bw/hr for\napproximately 30 min. If well tolerated (see section 4.4), the rate of administration may gradually be \nincreased to a maximum of 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr.\n\nIn PID patients who have tolerated the infusion rate of 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr well, the rate may be further \ngradually increased to a maximum of 7.2 ml/kg bw/hr.\n\nIf dilution prior to infusion is desired, Privigen may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final \nconcentration of 50 mg/ml (5%). For instruction, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also\nsection 4.4).\nHypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in patients with antibodies against IgA.\nPatients with hyperprolinaemia type I or II.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nCertain severe adverse reactions may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate \ngiven under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully \nobserved for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.\n\nCertain adverse reactions may occur more frequently:\n– in case of high rate of infusion,\n– in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia or agammaglobulinaemia, with or without IgA \n\ndeficiency,\n– in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when \n\nthe human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval \nsince the previous infusion.\n\nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients:\n– are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially infusing the product slowly \n\n(0.3 ml/kg bw/hr);\n– are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients \n\nnaive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or \nwhen there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the \nfirst infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect potential adverse \nsigns. All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration.\n\nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. \nThe treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction.\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.\n\nIn all patients, IVIg administration requires:\n– adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg\n– monitoring of urine output\n– monitoring of serum creatinine levels\n– avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics.\nFor patients suffering from diabetes mellitus and requiring dilution of Privigen to lower \nconcentrations, the presence of glucose in the recommended diluent should be taken into account.\n\n\n\n6\n\nHypersensitivity\nTrue hypersensitivity reactions are rare. They can occur in patients with anti-IgA antibodies.\n\nIVIg is not indicated in patients with selective IgA deficiency where the IgA deficiency is the only \nabnormality of concern.\n\nRarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactoid\nreaction, even in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin.\n\nHaemolytic anaemia\nIVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo \ncoating of red blood cells (RBC) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction \n(Coombs’ test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy \ndue to enhanced RBC sequestration.\nIsolated cases of haemolysis-related renal dysfunction/renal failure or disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation and death have occurred.\nThe following risk factors are associated with the development of haemolysis: high doses, whether \ngiven as a single administration or divided over several days; non-O blood group; and underlying \ninflammatory state. As this event was commonly reported in non-O blood group patients receiving \nhigh doses for non-PID indications, increased vigilance is recommended. Haemolysis has rarely been \nreported in patients given replacement therapy for PID.\n\nIVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of haemolysis. If signs and/or \nsymptoms of haemolysis develop during or after an IVIg infusion, discontinuation of the IVIg \ntreatment should be considered by the treating physician (see also section 4.8).\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS)\nAseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment.\nDiscontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without \nsequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. \nCerebrospinal fluid studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per \nmm3, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred \nmg/dl.\nAMS may occur more frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment.\n\nThromboembolism\nThere is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events \nsuch as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and \ndeep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through \nthe high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and \ninfusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events \n(such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic \nepisodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods \nof immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, patients with diseases which increase blood \nviscosity).\n\nIn patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the \nminimum rate of infusion and dose practicable.\n\nAcute renal failure\nCases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases risk \nfactors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, \noverweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65.\nIn case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered. While these reports of renal \ndysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many of the licensed IVIg \nproducts containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, those containing sucrose \n\n\n\n7\n\nas a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In patients at risk, the use of \nIVIg products that do not contain sucrose should therefore be considered. Privigen does not contain \nsucrose, maltose or glucose.\nIn patients at risk of acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of \ninfusion and dose practicable.\n\nTransfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary edema may very rarely occur following treatment with IVIg products. \nTRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left \nventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following treatment.\nMonitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with \nadequate ventilatory support.\n\nInterference with serological testing\nAfter injection of immunoglobulin, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in \nthe patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.\n\nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D, may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell antibodies, for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coombs’ \ntest).\n\nTransmissible agents\nPrivigen is made from human plasma. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use \nof medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of \nindividual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective \nmanufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products \nprepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents \ncannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for the non-enveloped viruses \nsuch as hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19.\n\nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 \ntransmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an \nimportant contribution to the viral safety.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time Privigen is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct.\n\nSodium content\nPrivigen is essentially sodium-free.\n\nPaediatric population\nAlthough limited data is available, it is expected that the same warnings, precautions and risk factors\napply to the paediatric population. In post marketing reports it is observed that IVIG high-dose \nindications in children, particularly Kawasaki disease, are associated with an increased reporting rate \nof haemolytic reactions compared to other IVIG indications in children.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines\nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the \nefficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella. After \nadministration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with \n\n\n\n8\n\nlive attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore, patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.\n\nPaediatric population\nAlthough limited data is available, it is expected that the same interactions may occur in the paediatric \npopulation.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled \nclinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding \nmothers. IVIg products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester.\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of \npregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected.\nExperimental studies of the excipient L-proline carried out in animals found no direct or indirect \ntoxicity affecting pregnancy, embryonal or foetal development.\n\nBreast-feeding\nImmunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to protecting the neonate from \npathogens which have a mucosal portal of entry.\n\nFertility\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be \nexpected.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions associated with \nPrivigen. Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve \nbefore driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nAdverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, \narthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally in connection with \nintravenous administration of human immunoglobulin.\n\nRarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated \ncases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous \nadministration.\n\nCases of reversible aseptic meningitis and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions (including \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus – frequency unknown) have been observed with human normal \nimmunoglobulin.\n\nReversible haemolytic reactions have been observed in patients, especially those with non-O blood \ngroups in immunomodulatory treatment. Rarely, haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion may \ndevelop after high dose IVIg treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nIncrease in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been observed.\n\nVery rarely: Transfusion related acute lung injury and thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial \ninfarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thromboses.\n\n\n\n9\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nSix clinical studies were performed with Privigen, which included patients with PID, ITP and CIDP. \nIn the pivotal PID study, 80 patients were enrolled and treated with Privigen. Of these, 72 completed \nthe 12 months of treatment. In the PID extension study, 55 patients were enrolled and treated with \nPrivigen. The two ITP studies were performed with 57 patients each. The two CIDP studies were\nperformed with 28 and 207 patients, respectively.\n\nMost adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed in the six clinical studies were mild to moderate in \nnature.\n\nThe following table shows an overview of the ADRs observed in the six clinical studies categorized \naccording the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred Term Level (PT) and frequency.\nFrequencies were evaluated according to the following conventions: Very common (1/10), Common \n(1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare \n(<1/10,000). For spontaneous post-marketing ADRs, the reporting frequency is categorized as \nunknown.\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing frequency.\n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class (SOC)\n\nAdverse Drug Reaction Frequency\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nAseptic meningitis Uncommon\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nAnaemia, haemolysis (including haemolytic \nanaemia), leukopenia\n\nCommon\n\nAnisocytosis (including microcytosis), \nthrombocytosis\n\nUncommon\n\nDecreased neutrophil count Unknown\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity Common\nAnaphylactic shock Unknown\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nHeadache (including sinus headache, migraine, \nhead discomfort, tension headache)\n\nVery common\n\nDizziness (including vertigo) Common\nSomnolence, tremor Uncommon\n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations, tachycardia Uncommon\nVascular disorders Hypertension, flushing (including hot flush, \n\nhyperaemia), hypotension \nCommon\n\nThromboembolic events, vasculitis (including \nperipheral vascular disorder)\n\nUncommon\n\nTransfusion related acute lung injury Unknown\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea (including chest pain, chest \ndiscomfort, painful respiration)\n\nCommon\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nNausea Very common\nVomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain Common\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Hyperbilirubinaemia Common\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nSkin disorder (including rash, pruritus, urticaria, \nmaculo-papular rash, erythema, skin exfoliation)\n\nCommon\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nMyalgia (including muscle spasms, \nmusculoskeletal stiffness, musculoskeletal pain)\n\nCommon\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nProteinuria, increased blood creatinine Uncommon\nAcute renal failure Unknown\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nPain (including back pain, pain in extremity, \narthralgia, neck pain, facial pain) pyrexia \n(including chills), influenza like illness\n\nVery common\n\n\n\n10\n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class (SOC)\n\nAdverse Drug Reaction Frequency\n\n(including nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal \npain, oropharyngeal blistering, throat tightness)\nFatigue, asthenia (including muscular weakness) Common\nInjection site pain Uncommon\n\nInvestigations Decreased haemoglobin (including decreased \nred blood cell count, decreased haematocrit), \nCoombs` (direct) test positive, increased alanine \naminotransferase, increased aspartate \naminotransferase, increased blood lactate \ndehydrogenase\n\nCommon\n\nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents and additional details on risk factors, see section 4.4.\n\nPaediatric Population\nIn Privigen clinical studies with paediatric patients, the frequency, nature and severity of adverse \nreactions did not differ between children and adults. In post marketing reports it is observed that the \nproportion of haemolysis cases to all case reports occurring in children is slightly higher than in adults.\nPlease refer to section 4.4 for details on risk factors and monitoring recommendations.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including \nelderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, \nfor intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02.\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of \nantibodies against infectious agents.\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1,000 donors. It has a distribution of \nimmunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. Adequate doses of \nthis medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the normal range and \nthus help against infections.\nThe mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but \nincludes immunomodulatory effects.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Privigen was evaluated in 6 prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter \nstudies performed in Europe (ITP, PID and CIDP studies) and the USA (PID study).\n\nPID\nThe PID pivotal study included a total of 80 patients aged between 3 and 69 years old. 19 children (3 \nto 11 years), 12 adolescents (12 to 16 years) and 49 adults were treated with Privigen over 12 months. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\n1038 infusions were administered, 272 (in 16 patients) in the 3-week schedule and 766 (in 64 patients) \nin the 4-week schedule. The median doses administered for the 3-week and 4-week treatment \nschedules were almost identical to each other (428.3 vs. 440.6 mg IgG/ kg bw).The PID extension \nstudy included a total of 55 patients aged between 4 and 81 years old. 13 children (3 to 11 years), \n8 adolescents (12 to 15 years) and 34 adults were treated with Privigen over 29 months. 771 infusions \nwere administered and the median dose administered was 492.3 mg IgG/kg bw.\n\nITP\nIn the ITP pivotal study, in total 57 patients aged between 15 and 69 years old were treated with 2 \ninfusions of Privigen for a total of 114 infusions. The scheduled dose of 1 g/kg bw per infusion was \nclosely adhered to in all patients (median 2 g IgG/kg bw).\n\nIn the second ITP study, 57 patients with ITP (baseline platelet counts ≤ 30×109 / l) aged between 18 \nand 65 years were treated with Privigen at 1 g/kg bw. On day 3 patients could receive a second dose of \n1 g/ kg bw, for patients with a platelet count of < 50×109 / l on day 3 this second dose was mandatory. \nOverall, in 42 subjects (74 %) the platelet count increased at least once to ≥ 50×109 / l within 6 days \nafter the first infusion, which was well within the expected range. A second dose in subjects with \nplatelet counts ≥ 50×109 /l after the first dose provided a relevant additional benefit in terms of higher \nand longer-lasting increases in platelet counts compared to a single dose. In subjects with platelet \ncounts < 50×109 / l after the first dose, 30% showed a platelet response of ≥ 50×109 / l after the \nmandatory second dose.\n\nCIDP\nIn the first CIDP study, a prospective multicenter open label trial (Privigen impact on mobility and \nautonomy PRIMA study), 28 patients (13 subjects who have previously received IVIG and 15 subjects\nnot) were treated with a Privigen loading dose of 2g/kg bw given over 2-5 days followed by 6 \nmaintenance doses of 1g/kg bw over 1-2 days every three weeks. Previously treated patients were \nwithdrawn from IVIG until confirmed deterioration before start of Privigen. On the adjusted 10 point \nINCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment) scale a clinically meaningful improvement \nof at least 1-point from baseline to treatment week 25 was observed in 17 out of 28 patients. The \nINCAT responder rate was 60.7% (95% confidence interval [42.41, 76.4]). 9 patients responded after \nreceiving the initial induction dose by week 4, 16 patients responded by week 10.\n\nMuscle strength as measured by the MRC (Medical Research Council) Score improved in all patients \nby 6.9 points (95% confidence interval [4.11, 9.75], in previously treated patients by 6.1 points (95% \nconfidence interval [2.72, 9.44]) and in untreated patients by 7.7 points (95% confidence interval \n[2.89, 12.44]). The MRC responder rate, an increase of at least 3 points, was 84.8% which was similar \nin previously treated (81.5% [58.95, 100.00]) and untreated (86.7% [69.46, 100.00]) patients.\nIn patients defined as INCAT non-responders, muscle strength improved by 5.5 points (95% \nconfidence interval [0.6, 10.2]) as compared to INCAT responders (7.4 points (95% confidence \ninterval [4.0, 11.7])\n\nIn a second prospective, multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study (Polyneuropathy \nand Treatment with Hizentra, PATH trial), 207 subjects with CIDP were treated with Privigen in the \nprerandomization phase of the study. Subjects all with IVIg pretreatment of at least 8 weeks and with\nan IVIg-dependence confirmed by clinically evident deterioration during an IVIg withdrawal phase of \nup to 12 weeks, received a Privigen loading dose of 2 g/kg bw followed by up to 4 Privigen \nmaintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw every 3 weeks for up to 13 weeks.\nFollowing clinical deterioration during IVIg withdrawal, clinical improvement of CIDP was primarily \ndefined by a decrease of ≥ 1 point at the adjusted INCAT score. Additional measures of CIDP \nimprovement were an increase in R-ODS (Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale) score of ≥ 4 points, a \nmean grip strength increase of ≥ 8 kPa, or an MRC sum score increase of ≥ 3 points. Overall, 91 % of \nsubjects (188 patients) showed improvement in at least one of the criteria above by week 13.\nBy adjusted INCAT score, the responder rate by week 13 was 72.9 % (151 / 207 patients), with \n149 patients responding already by week 10. A total of 43 of the 207 patients achieved a better CIDP \nstatus as assessed by the adjusted INCAT score compared to their CIDP status at study entry.\n\n\n\n12\n\nThe mean improvement at the end of the treatment period compared to reference visit was 1.4 points \nin the PRIMA (1.8 points in IVIg pretreated subjects) and 1.2 points in PATH study.\n\nIn PRIMA, the percentage of responders in the overall Medical Research Council (MRC) score\n(defined as an increase by ≥ 3 points) was 85 % (87 % in the IVIg-untreated and 82 % in IVIg-\npretreated) and 57 % in PATH. The overall median time to first MRC sum score response in PRIMA \nwas 6 weeks (6 weeks in the IVIg-untreated and 3 weeks in the IVIg-pretreated) and 9.3 weeks in \nPATH. MRC sum score in PRIMA improved by 6.9 points (7.7 points for IVIg-untreated and \n6.1 points for IVIg-pretreated) and by 3.6 points in PATH.\nThe grip strength of the dominant hand improved by 14.1 kPa (17.0 kPa in IVIg-untreated and \n10.8 kPa in IVIg pretreated subjects) in the PRIMA study, while in PATH the grip strength of the \ndominant hand improved by 12.2 kPa. For the non dominant hand similar results were observed in \nboth PRIMA and PATH trials.\n\nThe efficacy and safety profile in the PRIMA and the PATH study in CIDP patients were overall \ncomparable.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo differences were seen in the pharmacodynamic properties between adult and paediatric study \npatients.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nHuman normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient's \ncirculation after intravenous administration.\n\nDistribution\nIt is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and extravascular fluid, after approximately 3-5 \ndays equilibrium is reached between the intra- and extravascular compartments.\n\nElimination\nIgG and IgG complexes are broken down in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The half-life \nmay vary from patient to patient. The pharmacokinetic parameters for Privigen were determined in a \nclinical study in PID patients (see section 5.1). 25 patients (aged 13-69 years) participated in the \npharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. In this study, the median half-life of Privigen in PID patients was \n36.6 days. In an extension of this study, 13 PID patients (aged 3-65 years) participated in a PK sub-\nstudy. The results of this study show the median half-life of Privigen to be 31.1 days (see table below). \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of Privigen in PID patients\n\nParameter Pivotal Study (N= 25)\nZLB03_002CR\nMedian (Range)\n\nExtension Study (N=13) \nZLB05_006CR\nMedian (Range)\n\nCmax (peak, g/l) 23.4 (10.4-34.6) 26.3 (20.9-32.9)\nCmin (trough, g/l) 10.2 (5.8-14.7) 12.3 (10.4-18.8) (3-week schedule)\n\n9.4 (7.3-13.2) (4-week schedule)\nt½ (days) 36.6 (20.6-96.6) 31.1 (14.6-43.6)\n\nCmax, maximum serum concentration; Cmin, trough (minimum level) serum concentration; t½, \nelimination half-life\n\nPaediatric population\nNo differences were seen in the pharmacokinetic parameters between adult and paediatric study \npatients with PID.

L-proline is a physiological, non-\nessential amino acid.\n\nThe safety of Privigen has been assessed in several preclinical studies, with particular reference to the \nexcipient L-proline. Some published studies pertaining to hyperprolinaemia have shown that long-\nterm, high doses of L-proline have effects on brain development in very young rats. However, in \nstudies where the dosing was designed to reflect the clinical indications for Privigen, no effects on \nbrain development were observed. Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety \npharmacology and toxicity studies.\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nL-proline,  water for injections.\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products, diluents, or solvents except \nthose mentioned in section 6.6.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years\n\nStability after first opening:\nOnce the vial has been broached, its contents should be used promptly. Because the solution contains \nno preservative, Privigen should be infused immediately.\n\nStability after dilution:\nIf the product is diluted to lower concentrations (see section 6.6), immediate use after dilution is \nrecommended. The in-use stability of Privigen after dilution with a 5% glucose solution to a final \nconcentration of 50 mg/ml (5%) has been demonstrated for 10 days at 30°C; however, the microbial \ncontamination aspect was not studied.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nDo not store above 25 °C.\nDo not freeze.\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product and after dilution, see section 6.3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n25 ml of solution in a single vial (type I glass), with a stopper (elastomeric), a cap (aluminium crimp), \na flip off disc (plastic), label with integrated hanger.\n\n50 or 100 ml of solution in a single vial (type I or II glass), with a stopper (elastomeric), a cap \n(aluminium crimp), a flip off disc (plastic), label with integrated hanger.\n\n200 or 400 ml of solution in a single vial (type II glass), with a stopper (elastomeric), a cap \n(aluminium crimp), a flip off disc (plastic), label with integrated hanger.\n\n\n\n14\n\nPack sizes\n1 vial (2.5 g/25 ml, 5 g/50 ml, 10 g/100 ml, 20 g/200 ml or 40 g/400 ml),\n3 vials (10 g/100 ml or 20 g/200 ml).\n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nPrivigen comes as a ready-to-use solution in single-use vials. The product should be brought to room \ntemperature (25°C) before use. A vented infusion line should be used for the administration of \nPrivigen. Flushing of the infusion tubes with physiological saline or 5% glucose solution is permitted. \nAlways pierce the stopper at its centre, within the marked area.\n\nThe solution should be clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow. Solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits should not be used.\n\nIf dilution is desired, 5% glucose solution should be used. For obtaining an immunoglobulin solution \nof 50 mg/ml (5%), Privigen 100 mg/ml (10%) should be diluted with an equal volume of the 5% \nglucose solution. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed during the dilution of Privigen.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n7.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or healthcare professional.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Privigen is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you are given Privigen\n3. How to use Privigen\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Privigen\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Privigen is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Privigen is\n\nPrivigen belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins \nare also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections.\n\nHow Privigen works\n\nPrivigen contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. The \nmedicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present in human blood of \nhealthy people.\n\nWhat Privigen is used for\n\nPrivigen is used for the treatment of adults and children (0-18 years) in the following situations:\n\nA) to increase abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels (replacement \ntherapy):\n1. Patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce immunoglobulins\n\n(primary immunodeficiencies (PID)).\n2. Patients with an acquired immunodeficiency (SID) who suffer from severe or recurrent \n\ninfections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure \nor serum IgG level of <4 g/l.\n\nB) to treat certain inflammatory disorders (immunomodulation). There are 5 groups:\n1. Patients who do not have enough blood platelets (primary immune thrombocytopenia\n\n(ITP) and who are at high risk of bleeding or will have surgery in the near future.\n2. Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. This is an acute disease that is characterised by \n\ninflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes severe muscle weakness mainly in the \nlegs and upper limbs.\n\n3. Patients with Kawasaki disease. This is an acute disease that primarily affects young \nchildren. It is characterised by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body.\n\n\n\n27\n\n4. Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). This is a \nchronic disease that is characterised by inflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes \nmuscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and upper limbs.\n\n5. Patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This is a slowly progressive disease of \nthe motor nerves with weakness of arms and legs.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Privigen\n\n Read this section carefully. The information given should be taken into consideration by you \nand your doctor before you are given Privigen.\n\nDo NOT take Privigen\n if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins or to proline.\n if you have developed antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood.\n if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia type I or II (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the \n\namino acid proline in the blood). This is an extremely rare disorder. Only a few families with \nthis disease are known worldwide.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nWhich circumstances increase the risk of having side effects?\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if any of the circumstances listed \n\nbelow applies to you:\n You receive this medicine in high doses either on 1 day or over several days and you have a \n\nblood group A, B or AB and/or you have an underlying inflammatory condition. In these \ncircumstances, it has been commonly reported that immunoglobulins increase the risk of \nbreakdown of red blood cells (haemolysis).\n\n You are overweight, are elderly, have diabetes, have been bedridden for a long time, have high \nblood pressure, have low blood volume (hypovolaemia), have problems with your blood vessels \n(vascular diseases), have an increased tendency for blood clotting (thrombophilia or thrombotic \nepisodes) or have a disease or a condition which causes your blood to thicken (hyperviscous \nblood). In these circumstances, immunoglobulins may increase the risk of heart attack (cardiac \ninfarction), stroke, blood clots in the lung (lung embolism), or blockage of a blood vessel in the \nleg, although only very rarely.\n\n You are diabetic. Although Privigen does not contain sugar, it may be diluted with a special \nsugar solution (5% glucose), which could affect your blood sugar level.\n\n You have or had previously problems with your kidneys or take medicinal products that may \nharm your kidneys (nephrotoxic medicinal products). In these circumstances, immunoglobulins \nmay increase the risk of serious rapid loss of kidney function (acute renal failure) although only \nvery rarely. Loss of kidney function with fatal outcome has occurred in isolated haemolysis-\nrelated cases.\n\nWhat kind of monitoring is required during the infusion?\nFor your personal safety, treatment with Privigen will take place under the supervision of your doctor \nor healthcare professional. You will usually be observed during the whole infusion and for at least 20 \nminutes thereafter. In certain circumstances, special precautions may be necessary. Examples of such \ncircumstances are:\n you are receiving Privigen at a high infusion rate or\n you are receiving Privigen for the first time or after a long break in treatment (e.g. several \n\nmonths).\nIn these cases you will be closely observed during the whole infusion and for at least 1 hour \nafterwards.\n\nWhen may slowing or stopping the infusion be required?\n\n\n\n28\n\n You may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it.\nHowever, true allergic reactions are rare. They may occur even if you have previously received \nhuman immunoglobulins and had tolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you have \ndeveloped antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA. In these rare cases allergic \nreactions such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see also section 4 \n“Possible side effects”).\n\n In very rare cases transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) can occur after receiving \nimmunoglobulins. This will lead to non-heart related accumulation of fluid in the air spaces of \nthe lungs (non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema). You will recognize TRALI by severe difficulty \nin breathing (respiratory distress), abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), \nnormal heart function (left ventricular function) and increased body temperature (fever). \nSymptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours after receiving treatment.\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions \n\nduring the infusion of Privigen. He or she will decide whether to decrease the infusion \nrate or to stop the infusion completely.\n\nBlood tests\n Tell your doctor about your treatment with Privigen prior to having any blood tests.\n\nAfter receiving Privigen, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a \ncertain time.\n\nInformation on safety with respect to infections\nPrivigen is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood).\nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients. These include:\n careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded,\n the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections,\n the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove\n\nviruses.\nDespite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the \npossibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or \nemerging viruses and other types of infections.\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and \nparvovirus B19.\n\nImmunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections, possibly \nbecause antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective.\n It is strongly recommended that every time you are given a dose of Privigen the name and batch \n\nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.\n\nOther medicines and Privigen\n\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any \nother medicines.\n\nVaccinations\n Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Privigen.\n\nAfter receiving Privigen, the efficacy of certain vaccinations may be impaired. Affected are \nvaccinations with live attenuated virus vaccines such as vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella \nand varicella. Such vaccinations should be postponed for at least 3 months after the last infusion of \nPrivigen. In the case of measles vaccinations the impairment may persist for up to 1 year. Therefore,\nyour vaccinating doctor should check the effectiveness of the measles vaccination.\n\n\n\n29\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are\nbreast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Privigen during your \npregnancy or while you are breast-feeding.\n\nMedicines containing antibodies have been used in pregnant and breast-feeding women. Long-term\nexperience has shown that no harmful effects during the course of the pregnancy or to the newborn are \nto be expected.\nIf you receive Privigen while you are breast-feeding the antibodies in this medicine will also be found \nin the breast milk. Thus, also your baby can receive the protective antibodies.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPatients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Privigen that might \naffect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until\nthese effects have disappeared.\n\nPrivigen contains proline\n\nYou must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2 “What you need to know \nbefore you are given Privigen”).\n Tell your doctor prior to treatment.\n\n3. How to use Privigen\n\nPrivigen is intended solely for the infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion). It is usually administered \nby your doctor or healthcare professional. Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking \ninto account your weight, the specific circumstances listed under section 2 “Warnings and \nprecautions” and response to treatment. The dose calculation for children and young patients is not \ndifferent from that for adults. At the beginning of the infusion you will receive Privigen at a slow \ninfusion rate. If you tolerate this well, your doctor can gradually increase the infusion rate.\n\nIf you receive more Privigen than you should\n\nOverdose is very unlikely to occur because Privigen is usually administered under medical \nsupervision. If, in spite of this, you receive more Privigen than you should, your blood may become \ntoo thick (hyperviscous) which might increase the risk of developing blood clots. This may happen \nparticularly if you are a patient at risk, for example if you are elderly or if you suffer from a heart or\nkidney disease. Tell your doctor if you are known to have medical problems.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Possible \nside effects may be reduced or even avoided by infusing Privigen at a slow infusion rate. Such side \neffects may occur even if you have previously received human immunoglobulins and tolerated them \nwell.\n\nIn rare and isolated cases, the following side effects have been reported with immunoglobulin \npreparations:\n severe hypersensitivity reactions such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or anaphylactic shock \n\n(e.g. you may feel light-headed, dizzy, faint on standing, cold in the hands and feet, sense an \n\n\n\n30\n\nabnormal heart beat or chest pain, or have blurred vision) even when you have shown no \nhypersensitivity on previous infusions,\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such signs during \n\nthe infusion of Privigen. He or she will decide whether to decrease the infusion rate or to \nstop the infusion completely.\n\n formation of blood clots which may be carried off in the blood circulation (thromboembolic \nreactions) and which may result e.g. in myocardial infarction (e.g. when you have sudden chest \npain or shortness of breath), stroke (e.g. when you have a sudden onset of muscle weakness, \nhave loss of sensation and/or balance, decreased alertness or difficulty in speaking), blood clots \nin the arteries of the lungs (e.g. when you have chest pain, difficulty in breathing or are \ncoughing up blood), deep vein thrombosis (e.g. when you have redness, feel warmth, pain, \ntenderness, or have a swelling of one or both legs),\n\n chest pain, chest discomfort, painful respiration due to transfusion related lung injury (TRALI)\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you have any of the above \n\nsymptoms. Anyone experiencing such symptoms should immediately be transported to a \nhospital emergency room for evaluation and treatment.\n\n temporary non-infectious meningitis (reversible aseptic meningitis),\n Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you have a stiff neck together \n\nwith one or more of the following symptoms: fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, \nabnormal sensitivity to light, mental disturbances.\n\n increase in blood creatinine level,\n proteinuria,\n acute renal failure,\n transient decrease in red blood cells (reversible haemolytic anaemia/haemolysis), anaemia, \n\nleukopenia, anisocytosis (including microcytosis).\n\nSide effects observed in controlled clinical studies and in post-marketing experience are presented in o\nrder of decreasing frequency:\n\nVery Common (may occur with more than 1 in 10 patients):\nHeadache (including sinus headache, migraine, head discomfort, tension headache), upset stomach (na\nusea), pain (including back pain, pain in extremity, pain in joints and bones (arthralgia), neck pain, fac\nial pain), fever (including chills), flu-like illness (including runny nose (nasopharyngitis), sore throat (\npharyngolaryngeal pain), blisters in mouth and throat (oropharyngeal blistering), throat tightness.\n\nCommon (may occur with up to 1 in 10 patients):\nTemporary lowering of red blood cell count (anaemia), breakdown of red blood cells (haemolysis), \ndecreased number of white blood cells (leukopenia), hypersensitivity, dizziness (including vertigo),\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension), flushing (including hot flush, hyperaemia), hypotension (including \ndecreased blood pressure), breathlessness (dyspnoea including chest pain, chest discomfort, painful \nbreathing), vomiting, loose stools (diarrhea), stomach pain, skin disorder (including rash, itching\n(pruritus), hives (urticaria), maculopapular rash, redness of the skin (erythema), peeling of the skin \n(skin exfoliation)), pain in the muscles (including muscle cramps and rigidity), tiredness (fatigue), \nphysical weakness (asthenia), weakness in the muscles, .\nRoutine laboratory tests may commonly reveal changes to liver functions (hyperbilirubinaemia) as \nwell as changes in blood count (e.g. Coombs’ (direct) test positive), increased alanine \naminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood lactate dehydrogenase).\n\nUncommon (may occur with up to 1 in 100 patients):\nTemporary non-infectious meningitis (reversible aseptic meningitis), irregularity of red blood cell \nshape (microscopic finding), presence of high platelet counts in the blood (thrombocytosis),\nsleepiness, shiver (tremor), palpitations, tachycardia, thromboembolic events, lack of blood supply to \nthe lower extremities causing e.g. pain when walking (peripheral vascular disorder), presence of an \nexcess of serum proteins in the urine (proteinuria including increased blood creatinine), injection site \npain\n\n\n\n31\n\nIn isolated cases (post-marketing experience), the following have been observed in patients treated \nwith Privigen: abnormally low level of specific white blood cells called neutrophils (decreased \nneutrophils counts), anaphylactic shock, painful respiration due to transfusion related lung injury \n(TRALI) and acute renal failure.\n\n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any \npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet.\n\nPlease also refer to section 2 “What you need to know before you are given Privigen” for additional \ndetails on circumstances which increase the risk of side effects.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5.

If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be \nincreased to a maximum of 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr.\nIn PID patients who have tolerated the infusion rate of 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr well, the rate may be further \nincreased gradually to a maximum of 7.2 ml/kg bw/hr.\nIf dilution prior to infusion is desired, Privigen may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final \nconcentration of 50 mg/ml (5%).\n\nSpecial precautions\n\nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped.\nIt is strongly recommended that every time Privigen is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nproduct.\n\n\n\n35\n\nIncompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nthe section below.\n\nSpecial precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nThe product should be brought to room or body temperature before use. A vented infusion line should \nbe used for the administration of Privigen. Always pierce the stopper at its centre, within the marked \narea.\nThe solution should be clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow. Solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits should not be used.\nIf dilution is desired, 5% glucose solution is recommended. For obtaining an immunoglobulin solution \nof 50 mg/ml (5%), Privigen 100 mg/ml (10%) should be diluted with an equal volume of the glucose \nsolution. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed during the dilution of Privigen.\nOnce the vial has been entered under aseptic conditions, its contents should be used promptly. Because \nthe solution contains no preservative, Privigen should be infused as soon as possible.\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
