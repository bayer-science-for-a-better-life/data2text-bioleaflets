CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJyseleca is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult \npatients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying \nanti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Jyseleca may be used as monotherapy or in combination with \nmethotrexate (MTX). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with filgotinib should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nrheumatoid arthritis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of filgotinib for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 200 mg once daily. \n \nLaboratory monitoring, and dose initiation or interruption \nGuidance for laboratory monitoring, and dose initiation or interruption is provided in Table 1. \nTreatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is \ncontrolled (see section 4.4). \n \nTable 1: Laboratory measures and monitoring guidance \n \n\nLaboratory measure Action Monitoring guidance \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n\nTreatment should not be \ninitiated, or should be \ninterrupted, if ANC is \n< 1 × 109 cells/L. Treatment \nmay be restarted once ANC \nreturns above this value \n\nBefore treatment initiation and \nthereafter according to routine \npatient management \n\nAbsolute lymphocyte count \n(ALC) \n\nTreatment should not be \ninitiated, or should be \ninterrupted, if ALC is \n< 0.5 × 109 cells/L. Treatment \nmay be restarted once ALC \nreturns above this value \n\nHaemoglobin (Hb) \n\nTreatment should not be \ninitiated, or should be \ninterrupted, if Hb is < 8 g/dL. \nTreatment may be restarted \nonce Hb returns above this \nvalue \n\nLipid parameters \n\nPatients should be managed \naccording to international \nclinical guidelines for \nhyperlipidaemia \n\n12 weeks after initiation of \ntreatment and thereafter \naccording to international \nclinical guidelines for \nhyperlipidaemia \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nA starting dose of 100 mg once daily is recommended for patients aged 75 years and older as clinical \nexperience is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n[CrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min). A dose of 100 mg of filgotinib once daily is recommended for patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to < 60 mL/min). Filgotinib has not been studied in \npatients with end stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) and is therefore not recommended for use in \nthese patients (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A \nor B). Filgotinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) and is \ntherefore not recommended for use in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of filgotinib in children under the age of 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nJyseleca can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). It has not been studied if tablets can be \nsplit, crushed, or chewed, and it is recommended that tablets are swallowed whole. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nImmunosuppressive medicinal products \n \nCombination of filgotinib with other potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, ciclosporin, \ntacrolimus, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) or other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is not \nrecommended as a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded. \n \nInfections \n \nInfections, including serious infections, have been reported in patients receiving filgotinib. The most \nfrequent serious infection reported with filgotinib was pneumonia (see section 4.8). Among \nopportunistic infections, TB, oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis were reported with \nfilgotinib. \n \nThe risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating filgotinib in patients: \n \n• with chronic or recurrent infection \n• who have been exposed to TB \n• with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection \n• who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses; or \n• with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infections during \nand after filgotinib treatment. If an infection develops during treatment with filgotinib, the patient \nshould be carefully monitored and filgotinib treatment should be temporarily interrupted if the patient \nis not responding to standard antimicrobial therapy. Filgotinib treatment may be resumed once the \ninfection is controlled. \n \nAs there is a higher incidence of serious infections in the elderly aged 75 years and older, caution \nshould be used when treating this population. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTuberculosis \nPatients should be screened for TB before initiating filgotinib. Filgotinib should not be administered to \npatients with active TB (see section 4.3). In patients with latent TB, standard antimycobacterial \ntherapy should be initiated before administering filgotinib. \n \nPatients should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients \nwho tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating treatment. \n \nViral reactivation \n \nViral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in \nclinical studies (see section 4.8). If a patient develops herpes zoster, filgotinib treatment should be \ntemporarily interrupted until the episode resolves. \n \nScreening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed in accordance with \nclinical guidelines before starting and during treatment with filgotinib. Patients who were positive for \nboth hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus RNA were excluded from clinical studies. Patients who \nwere positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B virus DNA were excluded from clinical \nstudies. \n \nMalignancy \n \nThe risk of malignancies is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Immunomodulatory \nmedicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies. The clinical data are insufficient to assess \nthe potential incidence of malignancies following exposure to filgotinib. Long-term safety evaluations \nare ongoing. \n \nMalignancies were observed in clinical studies of filgotinib. The risks and benefits of filgotinib \ntreatment should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients with a known malignancy other \nthan a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing \nfilgotinib treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nNMSCs have been reported in patients treated with filgotinib. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis, and histopathological effects on male \nreproductive organs were observed (see section 5.3). The potential effect of filgotinib on sperm \nproduction and male fertility in humans is currently unknown. The reversibility of these potential \neffects is unknown. The potential risk of reduced fertility or infertility should be discussed with male \npatients before initiating treatment. \n \nHaematological abnormalities \n \nANC < 1 × 109 cells/L (see section 4.8) and ALC < 0.5 × 109 cells/L were reported in ≤ 1% of patients \nin clinical studies. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients \nwith an ANC < 1 × 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 × 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL observed during \nroutine patient management (see section 4.2). \n \nVaccinations \n \nUse of live vaccines during, or immediately prior to, filgotinib treatment is not recommended. It is \nrecommended that immunisations be updated in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior \nto initiating filgotinib treatment. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nLipids \n \nTreatment with filgotinib was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including \ntotal cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, while low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \nlevels were slightly increased (see section 4.8). LDL cholesterol returned to pre-treatment levels in the \nmajority of patients who started statin therapy while taking filgotinib. The effect of these lipid \nparameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined (see \nsection 4.2 for monitoring guidance). \n \nCardiovascular risk \n \nRheumatoid arthritis patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients should have \nrisk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nVenous thromboembolism \n \nEvents of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in \npatients receiving JAK inhibitors including filgotinib. JAK inhibitors should be used with caution in \npatients with risk factors for DVT/PE, such as older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, or \npatients undergoing surgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, \nfilgotinib treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by \nappropriate treatment. \n \nLactose content \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on filgotinib \n \nFilgotinib is primarily metabolised by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), which can be inhibited in vitro by \nmedicinal products such as fenofibrate, carvedilol, diltiazem or simvastatin. The clinical relevance of \nthis interaction is unknown. \n \nEffect of filgotinib on other medicinal products \n \nFilgotinib is not a clinically relevant inhibitor or inducer of most enzymes or transporters commonly \ninvolved in interactions such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases \n(UGT). \n \nIn vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce CYP2B6. In vivo \ninduction cannot be excluded. \n \nIn vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce or inhibit CYP1A2. No \nclinical studies have been performed to investigate interactions with CYP1A2 substrates and therefore \nthe potential in vivo effect of concomitant induction and inhibition of CYP1A2 by filgotinib is \nunknown. Caution is recommended when filgotinib is co-administered with CYP1A2 substrates with a \nnarrow therapeutic index. \n \nIn vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of the primary metabolite of filgotinib, \nGS-829845 to inhibit P-gp or BCRP. In vivo inhibition of these transporters cannot be excluded, and \ncaution is recommended when substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin) are \nco-administered with filgotinib. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that filgotinib and its primary metabolite GS-829845 are inhibitors of \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3. No clinical studies have been performed to investigate interactions with \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that co-administration of \nfilgotinib with OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates may increase their exposure and the risk of adverse \nevents. Co-administration with sensitive OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., valsartan, statins) is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nIn a clinical pharmacology study, there was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combined \ncontraceptive ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel when co-administered with filgotinib; thus no dose \nadjustment of oral contraceptives is required. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 1 week \nafter cessation of filgotinib treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgotinib in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBased on findings in animals, filgotinib may cause foetal harm and is therefore contraindicated during \npregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether filgotinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. Therefore, Jyseleca should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis, and histopathological effects on male \nreproductive organs were observed (see section 5.3). The potential effect of filgotinib on sperm \nproduction and male fertility in humans is currently unknown. The reversibility of these potential \neffects is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate effects with respect to fertility in females. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFilgotinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients \nshould be advised that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Jyseleca (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (3.5%), upper respiratory tract infection \n(URTI, 3.3%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 1.7%) and dizziness (1.2%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions are based on clinical studies (Table 2). The adverse reactions are \nlisted below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions \n \n\nFrequency a Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations \nCommon Urinary tract infection (UTI) \n\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI) \nUncommon Herpes zoster \n\nPneumonia \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon Neutropenia \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nUncommon Hypercholesterolaemia \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon Nausea \nInvestigations \nUncommon Blood creatine phosphokinase increased \na Frequency based on placebo-controlled pre-rescue period (week 12) pooled across FINCH 1 and 2, and \n\nDARWIN 1 and 2, for patients who received filgotinib 200 mg. \n \nLaboratory changes \n \nCreatinine \nAn increase in serum creatinine occurred with filgotinib treatment. At week 24 in the Phase 3 studies \n(FINCH 1, 2, and 3), the mean (SD) increase from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.07 (0.12) and \n0.04 (0.11) mg/dL for filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg, respectively. Mean creatinine values remained \nwithin the normal range. \n \nLipids \nTreatment with filgotinib was associated with dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol and HDL \nlevels, while LDL levels were slightly increased. LDL/HDL ratios were generally unchanged. Lipid \nchanges were observed within the first 12 weeks of filgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs (FINCH 1, FINCH 2, DARWIN 1, and \nDARWIN 2), the frequency of infection over 12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group was 18.1% \ncompared to 13.3% in the placebo group. In the MTX-controlled study FINCH 3, the frequency of \ninfection over 24 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX groups \nwas 25.2% and 23.1%, respectively, compared to 24.5% in the MTX group. The overall \nexposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of infections for the filgotinib 200 mg group across all seven \nPhase 2 and 3 clinical studies (2,267 patients) was 26.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE). \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, the frequency of serious infection over \n12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group was 1.0% compared to 0.6% in the placebo group. In the \nMTX-controlled study FINCH 3, the frequency of serious infection over 24 weeks in the filgotinib \n200 mg monotherapy and filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX groups was 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, \ncompared to 1.0% in the MTX group. The overall EAIR of serious infections for the filgotinib 200 mg \ngroup across all seven Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies (2,267 patients) was 1.7 per 100 PYE. The most \ncommon serious infection was pneumonia. The EAIR of serious infections remained stable with \nlong-term exposure. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThere was a higher incidence of serious infections in patients aged 75 years and older, although data \nare limited. \n \nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, the frequencies of infectious ADRs over \n12 weeks for filgotinib 200 mg compared to placebo were: URTI (3.3% versus 1.8%), UTI (1.7% \nversus 0.9%), pneumonia (0.6% versus 0.4%), and herpes zoster (0.1% versus 0.3%). Most of the \nherpes zoster events involved a single dermatome and were non-serious. \n \nOpportunistic infections (excluding TB) \nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, there were no opportunistic infections over \n12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group or the placebo group. In the MTX-controlled study FINCH 3, \nthe frequency of opportunistic infections over 24 weeks was 0, 0.2%, and 0 in the filgotinib 200 mg \nmonotherapy, filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX, and MTX groups, respectively. The overall EAIR of \nopportunistic infections for the filgotinib 200 mg group across all seven Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies \n(2,267 patients) was 0.1 per 100 PYE. \n \nNausea \nNausea was generally transient and reported during the first 24 weeks of filgotinib treatment. \n \nCreatine phosphokinase \nDose-dependent increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred within the first 12 weeks of \nfilgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter. At week 24 in the Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1, 2, \nand 3), the mean (SD) increase from baseline in CPK was -16 (449), 61 (260), and 33 (80) U/L for \nplacebo, filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg, respectively. \n \nIn placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies with background DMARDs (FINCH 1 and FINCH 2) through \n12 weeks, CPK elevations > 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.3% \nof patients in the placebo, filgotinib 200 mg, and filgotinib 100 mg groups, respectively. Most \nelevations > 5 × ULN did not require treatment discontinuation. \n \nExperience from long-term extension studies \n \nIn the long-term extension study DARWIN 3, among patients enrolled from DARWIN 1 (N = 497), \n238 patients received filgotinib 200 mg once a day for a median duration of 4.4 years; among patients \nenrolled from DARWIN 2 (N = 242), 234 patients received filgotinib 200 mg once a day for a median \nduration of 4.4 years. The safety profile of filgotinib was similar to that in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 \nstudies. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nFilgotinib has been administered in clinical studies following single and once daily administration up \nto 450 mg without dose-limiting toxicity. Adverse reactions were comparable to those seen at lower \ndoses and no specific toxicities were identified. Pharmacokinetic data following a single dose of \n100 mg filgotinib in healthy subjects indicate that approximately 50% of the administered dose is \neliminated within 24 hours of dosing and 90% of the dose is eliminated within 72 hours. In case of an \noverdose, it is recommended that a patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. \nTreatment of overdose with filgotinib consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of \nvital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. It is unknown whether filgotinib \ncan be removed by dialysis. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA45 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFilgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and reversible inhibitor of the JAK family. \nJAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor \ninteractions on the cellular membrane. JAK1 is important in mediating inflammatory cytokine signals, \nJAK2 in mediating myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis and JAK3 plays critical roles in immune \nhomeostasis and lymphopoiesis. Within the signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate \nsignal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity \nincluding gene expression. Filgotinib modulates these signalling pathways by preventing the \nphosphorylation and activation of STATs. In biochemical assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited the \nactivity of JAK1 and showed > 5-fold higher potency of filgotinib for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3 and \nTYK2. In human cellular assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited JAK1/JAK3-mediated signalling \ndownstream of the heterodimeric cytokine receptors for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-15, \nJAK1/2-mediated IL-6, and JAK1/TYK2-mediated type I interferons, with functional selectivity over \ncytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2 or JAK2/TYK2. GS-829845, the primary metabolite \nof filgotinib, was approximately 10-fold less active than filgotinib in in vitro assays, while exhibiting a \nsimilar JAK1 preferential inhibitory activity. In an in vivo rat model, the overall pharmacodynamic \neffect was predominantly driven by the metabolite. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nInhibition of IL-6 induced STAT1 phosphorylation \nFilgotinib administration resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT1 \nphosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects. Filgotinib administration did not affect \nJAK2-associated GM-CSF induced STAT5 phosphorylation. \n \nImmunoglobulins \nIn FINCH 1, 2, and 3, the median and interquartile ranges for serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values \nremained largely within the normal reference ranges through 24 weeks of treatment with filgotinib. \n \nHaematologic effects \nTreatment with filgotinib was associated with a small, transient increase in mean ALC that remained \nwithin normal reference ranges and gradually returned to at or near baseline levels with continued \ntreatment by week 12. In FINCH 1, 2, and 3, median haemoglobin values remained stable within the \nnormal range through 24 weeks of filgotinib treatment. A slight decrease in median platelet counts \noccurred within the first 4 weeks of filgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter through \n24 weeks. Median platelet counts remained within the normal range. \n \nC-reactive protein \nDecreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as early as 2 weeks after starting \ntreatment with filgotinib and were maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of filgotinib once daily were assessed in three Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1, 2, \nand 3). These were randomised, double-blind, multicentre studies in patients with moderate to severe \nactive rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology \n(ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nFINCH 1 was a 52-week study in 1,755 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate \nresponse to MTX. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily, filgotinib 100 mg once daily, \nadalimumab every 2 weeks, or placebo, all added to stable background MTX. At week 24, patients \nreceiving placebo were re-randomised to filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg once daily through week 52. \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 12. \n \nFINCH 2 was a 24-week study in 448 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate \nresponse to bDMARDs. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily, filgotinib 100 mg once daily, \nor placebo, all with a continued stable background dose of conventional synthetic DMARD(s) \n(csDMARD[s]: MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide). The primary endpoint was \nthe proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 12. \n \nFINCH 3 was a 52-week study in 1,249 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were naïve to MTX \ntherapy. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily plus MTX once weekly, filgotinib 100 mg once \ndaily plus MTX once weekly, filgotinib 200 mg (monotherapy) once daily, or MTX (monotherapy) \nonce weekly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response \nat week 24. \n \nClinical response \nHigher response rates versus placebo or MTX were seen at week 2 for ACR20, and responses were \nmaintained through week 52. \n \nTreatment with filgotinib 200 mg resulted in improvements in all individual ACR components, \nincluding tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessments, Health \nAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), pain assessment and high sensitivity CRP, \ncompared to placebo or MTX. In two of the Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1 and FINCH 2), the comparison \n(versus placebo) was carried out on top of MTX or csDMARD(s) (see above). \n \nLow disease activity and remission \nAcross the Phase 3 studies, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg \nplus MTX or other csDMARD achieved low disease activity and/or remission (DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 and \nDAS28-CRP < 2.6) at weeks 12 and 24 as compared to placebo or MTX. Filgotinib 200 mg was \nnon-inferior to adalimumab at week 12 for DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 in FINCH 1 (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Clinical response at weeks 12, 24 and 52 in FINCH 1, 2, and 3 \n \n\n FINCH 1 MTX-IR \nFINCH 2 \n\nbDMARD-IR \nFINCH 3 \n\nMTX-naïve \n\nTreatment \nFIL \n\n200 mg \nFIL \n\n100 mg ADA PBO \nFIL \n\n200 mg \nFIL \n\n100 mg PBO \nFIL \n\n200 mg \n+ MTX \n\nFIL \n100 mg \n+ MTX \n\nFIL \n200 mg \nmono \n\nMTX \n+ MTX + csDMARD \n\nN 475 480 325 475 147 153 148 416 207 210 416 \nWeek \nACR20 (percent of patients) \n\n12 77***¶ 70*** 71 50 66*** 58*** 31 77††† 72†† 71†† 59 \n24 78††† 78††† 74 59 69††† 55††† 34 81*** 80* 78 71 \n52 78 76 74 - - - - 75††† 73†† 75††† 62 \n\nACR50 (percent of patients) \n12 47†††¶¶¶ 36††† 35 20 43††† 32††† 15 53††† 44††† 46††† 28 \n24 58††† 53††† 52 33 46††† 35†† 19 62††† 57†† 58†† 46 \n52 62 59 59 - - - - 62††† 59†† 61††† 48 \n\nACR70 (percent of patients) \n12 26†††¶¶¶ 19††† 14 7 22††† 14† 7 33††† 27††† 29††† 13 \n24 36†††¶ 30††† 30 15 32††† 20†† 8 44††† 40††† 40††† 26 \n52 44 38 39 - - - - 48††† 40†† 45††† 30 \n\n\n\n12 \n\n FINCH 1 MTX-IR \nFINCH 2 \n\nbDMARD-IR \nFINCH 3 \n\nMTX-naïve \n\nTreatment \nFIL \n\n200 mg \nFIL \n\n100 mg ADA PBO \nFIL \n\n200 mg \nFIL \n\n100 mg PBO \nFIL \n\n200 mg \n+ MTX \n\nFIL \n100 mg \n+ MTX \n\nFIL \n200 mg \nmono \n\nMTX \n+ MTX + csDMARD \n\nN 475 480 325 475 147 153 148 416 207 210 416 \nDAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 (percent of patients) \n\n12 50***### 39*** 43 23 41*** 37*** 16 56††† 50††† 48††† 29 \n24 61†††§§§¶¶ 53†††§§§ 50 34 48††† 38††† 21 69††† 63††† 60††† 46 \n52 66¶ 59 59 - - - - 69††† 60†† 66††† 48 \n\nDAS28-CRP < 2.6 (percent of patients) \n12 34†††§§§¶¶¶ 24†††§§ 24 9 22††† 25††† 8 40††† 32††† 30††† 17 \n24 48***§§§¶¶¶ 35***§§§ 36 16 31††† 26†† 12 54*** 43*** 42††† 29 \n52 54¶ 43 46 - - - - 53††† 43†† 46††† 31 \n\nCDAI, change from baseline (mean) \n12 -26.0††† -23.3††† -23.5 -20.3 -26.2††† -23.8††† -17.3 -27.8††† -26.1††† -27.5††† -22.7 \n24 -30.6††† -28.6††† -28.4 -26.3 -30.9††† -27.8†† -25.4 -31.3††† -30.0††† -31.3††† -28.2 \n52 -32.9 -30.9 -31.6 - - - - -33.8††† -31.9† -33.6††† -31.2 \n\nADA: adalimumab; bDMARD: biologic DMARD; csDMARD: conventional synthetic DMARD; DMARD: \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug; FIL: filgotinib; IR: inadequate responder; mono: monotherapy; MTX: methotrexate; \nPBO: placebo. \n* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001 versus placebo (versus MTX for FINCH 3) (statistically significant difference with \n\nmultiplicity adjustment). \n† p ≤ 0.05; †† p ≤ 0.01; ††† p ≤ 0.001 versus placebo (versus MTX for FINCH 3) (nominal p-value). \n# p ≤ 0.05; ## p ≤ 0.01; ### p ≤ 0.001 versus adalimumab for FINCH 1 (non-inferiority test, statistically significant \n\ndifference with multiplicity adjustment) (analysed for DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 and < 2.6 pairwise comparisons only). \n§ p ≤ 0.05; §§ p ≤ 0.01; §§§ p ≤ 0.001 versus adalimumab for FINCH 1 (non-inferiority test, nominal p-value) (analysed \n\nfor DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 and < 2.6 pairwise comparisons only). \n¶ p ≤ 0.05; ¶¶ p ≤ 0.01; ¶¶¶ p ≤ 0.001 versus adalimumab for FINCH 1 (superiority test, nominal p-value) (analysed for \n\nACR20/50/70, and DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 and < 2.6 pairwise comparisons only). \nNote: Comparisons were carried out on top of a stable background of MTX (FINCH 1) or csDMARD(s) (FINCH 2). \n \nRadiographic response \nInhibition of progression of structural joint damage was assessed using the modified Total Sharp Score \n(mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score, at weeks 24 and 52 in \nFINCH 1 and FINCH 3. \n \nIn patients who had an inadequate response to MTX, treatment with filgotinib plus MTX resulted in \nstatistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage compared to placebo plus \nMTX at week 24 (Table 4).

Filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures (AUC) and Cmax were similar in healthy adult subjects \nand patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures (AUC) and Cmax are \ndose-proportional over the therapeutic dose range. Steady-state concentrations of filgotinib are \nachieved in 2 - 3 days with negligible accumulation after once daily administration. Steady-state \nconcentrations of GS-829845 are achieved in 4 days with approximately 2-fold accumulation after \nonce daily dosing of filgotinib. \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in exposures when filgotinib was administered with a \nhigh-fat or low-fat meal as compared to a fasted state. Filgotinib can be administered with or without \nfood. \n \nThe multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters of filgotinib and GS-829845 are provided in Table 6. \n \nTable 6: Multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters of filgotinib and GS-829845 following oral \nadministration of filgotinib 200 mg with or without food in adults with moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis \n \n\nParameter a \nMean (%CV) Filgotinib \n\nb GS-829845 c \n\nCmax (µg/mL) 2.15 (48.1) 4.43 (29.3) \nAUCtau (µg•h/mL) 6.77 (43.7) 83.2 (27.3) \nCV: coefficient of variation. \na From intensive PK analyses of studies FINCH 1, FINCH 2, and FINCH 3 in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving \n\n200 mg filgotinib once daily. \nb N = 37 \nc N = 33 \n \nDistribution \n \nFilgotinib and GS-829845 binding to human plasma proteins is low (55 - 59% and 39 - 44% bound, \nrespectively). The blood-to-plasma ratio of filgotinib ranged from 0.85 to 1.1 indicating no preferential \ndistribution of filgotinib and GS-829845 into blood cells. Filgotinib and GS-829845 are substrates of \nthe P-gp transporter. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFilgotinib is extensively metabolised with approximately 9.4% and 4.5% of an orally administered \ndose recovered as unchanged filgotinib in urine and faeces, respectively. Filgotinib is primarily \nmetabolised by CES2, and to a lesser extent by CES1. Both CES2 and CES1 form GS-829845, an \nactive circulating metabolite that is approximately 10-fold less potent than the parent compound. In a \nclinical pharmacology study, filgotinib and GS-829845 accounted for the majority of radioactivity \ncirculating in plasma (2.9% and 92%, respectively). No other major metabolites were identified. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nAs both filgotinib and GS-829845 contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined into a single \nparameter, AUCeff. AUCeff is the sum of the AUC of filgotinib and GS-829845, corrected for their \nrespective molecular weights and potencies. \n \nElimination \n \nApproximately 87% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine as filgotinib and its \nmetabolites, while about 15% of the dose was eliminated in the faeces. GS-829845 accounted for \napproximately 54% and 8.9% of dose recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The mean terminal \nhalf-lives of filgotinib and GS-829845 were approximately 7 and 19 hours, respectively. \n \nOther special populations \n \nWeight, gender, race, and age \nBodyweight, gender, race, and age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics \n(AUC) of filgotinib or GS-829845. \n \nElderly \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in mean filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures (AUC and \nCmax) between older patients aged ≥ 65 years relative to adult patients aged < 65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and GS-829845 were unaffected in subjects with mild renal \nimpairment (CrCl 60 to < 90 mL/min). Increases in exposures (AUC) of filgotinib, GS-829845, and \ncombined AUCeff (≤ 2-fold), were observed in subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to \n< 60 mL/min). In subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min), filgotinib exposure \n(AUC) increased by 2.2-fold and GS-829845 exposure significantly increased by 3.5-fold leading to a \n3-fold increase in AUCeff. The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib has not been studied in subjects with end \nstage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo clinically relevant changes in the exposures (AUC) of filgotinib and GS-829845 individually, or \ntheir combined exposure (AUCeff), were observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh B). The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib has not been studied in subjects with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). \n \nEffect of filgotinib on other medicinal products \n \nPotential interactions between filgotinib and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 7 \nbelow (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, and no change as “↔”; no effect boundaries are \n70 - 143% unless otherwise indicated). \n \nTable 7: Interaction studies with filgotinib 1 \n \nMedicinal product by therapeutic \n\nareas/Possible mechanism of \ninteraction \n\nEffects on medicinal product levels. \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nfilgotinib \nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntimycobacterials \nRifampicin (600 mg once daily) 2 \n \n(P-gp induction) \n\nFilgotinib: \nAUC: ↓ 27% \nCmax: ↓ 26% \n \nGS-829845: \nAUC: ↓ 38% \nCmax: ↓ 19% \n \nAUCeff 6: ↓ 33% \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas/Possible mechanism of \n\ninteraction \n\nEffects on medicinal product levels. \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nfilgotinib \nAntifungals \nItraconazole (200 mg single dose) 3 \n \n(P-gp inhibition) \n\nFilgotinib: \nAUC: ↑ 45% \nCmax: ↑ 64% \n \nGS-829845: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \nAUCeff: ↑ 21% \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nGASTRIC ACID REDUCING AGENTS \nFamotidine (40 mg twice daily) 2 \n \n(Increases gastric pH) \n\nFilgotinib: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \nGS-829845: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nOmeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 \n \n(Increases gastric pH) \n\nFilgotinib: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↓ 27% \n \nGS-829845: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nORAL ANTI-DIABETICS \nMetformin (850 mg single dose) 4 \n \n(Inhibition of OCT2, MATE1, and \nMATE-2K) \n\nMetformin: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nORAL CONTRACEPTIVES \nEthinyl estradiol (0.03 mg single \ndose)/Levonorgestrel (0.15 mg \nsingle dose) 4 \n\nEthinyl estradiol: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \nLevonorgestrel: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nSEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS \nMidazolam (2 mg single dose) 4,5 \n \n(Inhibition of CYP3A4) \n\nMidazolam: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \n1’OH-midazolam: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n\nNo dose adjustment is required \nupon co-administration. \n\nGS-829845: primary metabolite of filgotinib. \n1 All interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers. \n2 Study conducted with filgotinib 200 mg single dose. \n3 Study conducted with filgotinib 100 mg single dose. \n4 Study conducted with filgotinib 200 mg once daily. \n5 Bioequivalence boundaries are 80 - 125% for midazolam and 1’OH-midazolam. \n6 As both filgotinib and GS-829845 contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined into a single parameter, AUCeff. \n\nAUCeff is the combined AUC of filgotinib and GS-829845, adjusted for their respective molecular weights and potencies. \n \nPotential for filgotinib to affect other medicinal products \nIn vitro data indicate that filgotinib and GS-829845 do not inhibit the activity of the following: \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and \n\n\n\n17 \n\nUGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations. The potential for filgotinib to induce CYP2B6 \nconstitutive androstane receptor (CAR) mediated metabolism in vivo is unknown. No conclusion can \nbe drawn from the in vitro data regarding the potential of filgotinib to inhibit or induce CYP1A2. \nIn vivo data demonstrated no inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that filgotinib and GS-829845 are not inhibitors of OCT1, BSEP, OAT1, \nOAT3 or OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro data indicate that filgotinib and \nGS-829845 have the potential to inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1 (filgotinib only), and \nMATE-2K. While in vitro studies indicate that filgotinib is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP, the \nresults for GS-829845 are inconclusive and in vivo inhibition of P-gp or BCRP by GS-829845 cannot \nbe excluded. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of filgotinib was evaluated in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study and \na 2-year rat study. Filgotinib was not carcinogenic in mice at up to 150 mg/kg/day, which resulted in \nexposures of approximately 25 and 12 times the exposures in humans at the 100 mg and 200 mg once \ndaily doses, respectively. In the 2-year rat study, filgotinib treatment resulted in an increase in \nincidence and decrease in latency of benign Leydig cell tumours at the highest dose of 45 mg/kg/day \n(exposures of approximately 4.2 times exposures in humans at the 200 mg once daily dose); the \nclinical relevance of this finding is low. \n \nFilgotinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro \nchromosome aberration assay, and in vivo rat micronucleus assay. \n \nAdverse findings of degeneration/necrosis of incisor ameloblasts were observed in rats at exposures \n21- to 28-fold greater than clinical exposures at the 200 mg filgotinib dose, with exposure margins at \nthe NOAEL ranging from 3.5- to 8-fold. The human relevance of these dental findings is considered \nlow since in contrast to adult patients, ameloblasts in rats persist into adulthood to support lifelong \ncontinuous incisor growth. \n \nImpaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs (testes and \nepididymis) were observed with filgotinib in rats and dogs. At the no-observed-adverse-effect-levels \n(NOAELs) in dogs (the most sensitive species), the exposure margin is 2.7-fold at the 200 mg once \ndaily dose in humans. The severity of the histological effects was dose-dependent. Spermatogenic and \nhistopathological effects were not fully reversible at lower exposures and were irreversible at exposure \nmargins of approximately 7- to 9-fold the exposure at the 200 mg once daily dose in humans. \n \nEmbryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated embryolethality and \nteratogenicity at exposures comparable to 200 mg filgotinib once daily dosing in humans. Visceral and \nskeletal malformations and/or variations were observed at all dose levels of filgotinib. \n \nFilgotinib was administered to pregnant rats at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day. Dose-related \nincreases in the incidence of internal hydrocephaly, dilated ureters, and multiple vertebral anomalies \nwere seen at all dose levels. At 100 mg/kg/day, an increased number of early and late resorptions were \nnoted together with a decreased number of viable foetuses. In addition, foetal body weights were \ndecreased. \n \nIn rabbits, filgotinib caused visceral malformations mainly in the lungs and cardiovascular system, at a \ndose level of 60 mg/kg/day. Filgotinib caused skeletal malformations affecting the vertebral column \nregion at dose levels of 25 and 60 mg/kg/day, mainly in vertebra, ribs and sternebrae. Fused sternebrae \nalso occurred at 10 mg/kg/day filgotinib. Retarded skeletal ossification was evidenced at 60 mg/kg/day. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nNo adverse effects on pre-/postnatal development were observed in rats in a pre- and postnatal \ndevelopment study of filgotinib and GS-829845. Filgotinib and GS-829845 were detected in nursing \nrat pups after administration of filgotinib to lactating female rats from gestation day 6 through 10 days \npost-partum at dose levels of 2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day, likely due to the presence of filgotinib in milk. \nAt the highest tested dose, maternal systemic exposure (AUC) to filgotinib in rats was approximately \n2 times the exposure in humans at the 200 mg once daily dose; exposures in nursing pups were less \nthan 6% that of maternal exposure on day 10 post-partum. Due to the low exposure of the animals, the \npre-/postnatal development study was considered inconclusive. \n \n \n6.

What Jyseleca is and what it is used for \n \nJyseleca contains the active substance filgotinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus kinase \ninhibitors, which help reduce inflammation. \n \nJyseleca is used to treat adults with rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease of the joints. It \ncan be used if previous therapy did not work well enough, or was not tolerated. Jyseleca can be used \non its own, or together with another arthritis medicine, methotrexate. \n \nJyseleca reduces inflammation in your body. It helps to reduce pain, tiredness, stiffness and \nswelling in your joints, and it slows down damage to the bone and cartilage in the joints. These effects \ncan help you to perform your normal daily activities, and improve your quality of life. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Jyseleca \n \nDo not take Jyseleca \n• if you are allergic to filgotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you have active tuberculosis (TB). \n• if you have an active serious infection (see section “Warnings and precautions”). \n• if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \n \n→ If any of these apply to you, do not take Jyseleca and tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jyseleca: \n• if you have an infection, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor if you become ill \n\n(especially with a fever or chills, shortness of breath, persistent cough, or tiredness) while you \nare taking Jyseleca. Jyseleca can reduce your body’s ability to fight infections. It may make an \nexisting infection worse or increase the chance of you getting a new infection. If you are aged \n75 years or older, there is a higher risk of you getting a serious infection. \n\n• if you have ever had tuberculosis (TB), or have come into contact with somebody with TB. \nYou may need tests to check for tuberculosis before and during treatment with Jyseleca. \n\n• if you have had a herpes zoster infection (shingles) in the past, Jyseleca can allow it to come \nback. Tell your doctor if you get a painful skin rash with blisters during Jyseleca treatment as \nthese can be signs of shingles. \n\n• if you have ever had hepatitis B or C. \n• if you have cancer. Your doctor will have to decide if you can be given Jyseleca. \n• if you are at high risk of developing skin cancer, your doctor may recommend preventive \n\nmeasures such as regular skin examinations while taking Jyseleca. Talk to your doctor if you \ndevelop a new mark or any change in the appearance of an area on the skin. Some patients \ntreated with Jyseleca have developed skin cancers. \n\n• if you are a man, Jyseleca may decrease your fertility (lower your ability to father a child) or \ncause infertility (inability to father a child). See also section “Male fertility”. \n\n• if you recently had a vaccine, or are due to have one. Certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) \nare not recommended while using Jyseleca. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you start \nJyseleca. They may want to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccinations. \n\n• if you have heart problems, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. \n• if you have had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs \n\n(pulmonary embolism) in the past.
