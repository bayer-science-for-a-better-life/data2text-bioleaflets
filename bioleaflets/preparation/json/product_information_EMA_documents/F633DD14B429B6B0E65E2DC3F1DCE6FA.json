This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nShingrix powder and suspension for suspension for injection \nHerpes zoster vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nPowder and suspension for suspension for injection. \nThe powder is white. \nThe suspension is an opalescent, colourless to pale brownish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nShingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults \n50 years of age or older (see section 5.1). \n \nThe use of Shingrix should be in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses of 0.5 ml each: an initial dose followed by a \nsecond dose 2 months later. \nIf flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 \nand 6 months after the first dose (see section 5.1). \n \nThe need for booster doses following the primary vaccination schedule has not been established (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nShingrix can be given with the same schedule in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated \nHZ vaccine (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nShingrix is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Shingrix in children and adolescents have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications   \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPrior to immunisation \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nAs with other vaccines, vaccination with Shingrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an \nacute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not \nresult in the deferral of vaccination. \n \nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. \n \nThe vaccine is for prophylactic use only and is not intended for treatment of established clinical \ndisease. \n \nDo not administer the vaccine intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nSubcutaneous administration is not recommended. \nMaladministration via the subcutaneous route may lead to an increase in transient local reactions.  \n \nShingrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support replacing a dose of Shingrix with a \ndose of another HZ vaccine. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThere are limited data to support the use of Shingrix in individuals with a history of HZ and in frail \nindividuals including those with multiple comorbidities (see section 5.1). Healthcare professionals \ntherefore need to weigh the benefits and risks of HZ vaccination on an individual basis. \n \nSystemic immunosuppressive medications and immunodeficiency \n \nSafety and immunogenicity data on a limited number of immunocompromised subjects with human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) or haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) are available (see section \n5.1). The use of Shingrix in subjects with other confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or \nimmunodeficient conditions is under investigation.  \nAs with other vaccines, an adequate immune response may not be elicited in these individuals. The \nadministration of Shingrix to immunocompromised subjects should be based on careful consideration \nof potential benefits and risks. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nShingrix can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine,  \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or reduced antigen diphtheria-tetanus-\nacellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa). The vaccines should be administered at different injection sites. \n \nIn three phase III, controlled, open-label clinical studies, adults ≥ 50 years of age were randomised to \nreceive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first dose or non-\nconcomitantly with an unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (N=828; Zoster-004), a \nPPV23 vaccine (N=865; Zoster-035) or a dTpa vaccine formulated with 0.3 milligrams Al3+ (N=830; \nZoster-042). The immune responses of the co-administered vaccines were unaffected, with the \nexception of lower geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens \n(pertactin) when Shingrix is co-administered with the dTpa vaccine. The clinical relevance of this data \nis not known.  \n \nThe adverse reactions of fever and shivering were more frequent when PPV23 vaccine is co-\nadministered with Shingrix. \n \nConcomitant use with other vaccines is not recommended due to lack of data. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Shingrix in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or \npost-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Shingrix during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThe effect on breast-fed infants of administration of Shingrix to their mothers has not been studied. \nIt is unknown whether Shingrix is excreted in human milk. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects with respect to fertility in males or females \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Shingrix on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nShingrix may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines in the 2-3 days \nfollowing vaccination. Fatigue and malaise may occur following administration (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (68.1% overall/dose; \n3.8% severe/dose), myalgia (32.9% overall/dose; 2.9% severe/dose), fatigue (32.2% overall/dose; \n3.0% severe/dose) and headache (26.3% overall/dose; 1.9% severe/dose). Most of these reactions were \nnot long-lasting (median duration of 2 to 3 days). Reactions reported as severe lasted 1 to 2 days. \n \nThe incidence of adverse reactions was higher in subjects aged 50-69 years compared to those aged \n≥70 years, especially for general adverse reactions such as myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever \nand gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe safety profile presented below is based on a pooled analysis of data generated in placebo-\ncontrolled clinical studies on 5,887 adults 50-69 years of age and 8,758 adults ≥ 70 years of age. \nAdverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance are also tabulated below. \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common   (≥1/10) \nCommon  (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon   (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare   (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare  (<1/10,000) \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon lymphadenopathy \n\nImmune system disorders Rare hypersensitivity reactions including \nrash, urticaria, angioedema1 \n\nNervous system disorders Very common headache \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common gastrointestinal symptoms (including \nnausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or \nabdominal pain) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common myalgia \n\nUncommon arthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common injection site reactions (such as pain, \nredness, swelling), fatigue, chills, fever \n\nCommon injection site pruritus, malaise \n1Adverse reactions from spontaneous reporting \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions   \n\n\n\n6 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties   \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Varicella zoster vaccines, ATC code: J07BK03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBy combining the VZV specific antigen (gE) with an adjuvant system (AS01B), Shingrix is designed \nto induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in individuals with pre-existing \nimmunity against VZV. \n \nNon-clinical data show that AS01B induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune \nsystem through specific molecular pathways. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen \npresenting cells carrying gE-derived antigens in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to the \ngeneration of gE-specific CD4+ T cells and antibodies. The adjuvant effect of AS01B is the result of \ninteractions between MPL and QS-21 formulated in liposomes. \n \nEfficacy of Shingrix \n \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster (HZ) and Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) \n \nIn two phase III, placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy studies of Shingrix: \n- ZOE-50 (Zoster-006): 15,405 adults ≥ 50 years were randomised to receive two doses of either \n\nShingrix (N=7,695) or placebo (N=7,710) administered 2 months apart, \n- ZOE-70 (Zoster-022): 13,900 adults ≥ 70 years were randomised to receive two doses of either \n\nShingrix (N=6,950) or placebo (N=6,950) administered 2 months apart. \nThe studies were not designed to demonstrate efficacy in subgroups of frail individuals, including \nthose with multiple comorbidities, although these subjects were not excluded from the studies. \n \nEfficacy results against HZ and PHN observed in the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC), i.e. \nexcluding adults who did not receive the second dose of vaccine or who had a confirmed diagnosis of \nHZ within one month after the second dose, are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. \n \nShingrix significantly decreased the incidence of HZ compared with placebo in subjects ≥ 50 years (6 \nvs. 210 cases in ZOE-50) and in subjects ≥ 70 years (25 vs. 284 cases in the pooled analysis of ZOE-\n50 and ZOE-70). \n \nTable 1: Shingrix efficacy against HZ  \n \n\nAge \n(years) \n\nShingrix Placebo \nVaccine efficacy \n\n(%) \n[95% CI] \n\nNumber \nof \n\nevaluable\nsubjects \n\nNumber \nof HZ \ncases \n\nIncidence \nrate per \n\n1000 \nperson \nyears \n\nNumber \nof \n\nevaluable \nsubjects \n\nNumber \nof HZ \ncases \n\nIncidence \nrate per \n\n1000 \nperson \nyears \n\n\n\n7 \n\nZOE-50* \n\n≥ 50 7,344 6 0.3 7,415 210 9.1 97.2 [93.7; 99.0] \n 50-59 3,492 3 0.3 3,525 87 7.8 96.6 [89.6; 99.4] \n≥ 60 3,852 3 0.2 3,890 123 10.2 97.6 [92.7; 99.6] \n 60-69 2,141 2 0.3 2,166 75 10.8 97.4 [90.1; 99.7] \n\nPooled ZOE-50 and ZOE-70** \n\n≥ 70 8,250 25 0.8 8,346 284 9.3 91.3 [86.8; 94.5] \n 70-79 6,468 19 0.8 6,554 216 8.9 91.3 [86.0; 94.9] \n≥ 80 1,782 6 1.0 1,792 68 11.1 91.4 [80.2; 97.0] \nCI  Confidence interval \n* Over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years \n** Over a median follow-up period of 4.0 years \n\nData in subjects ≥ 70 years of age are sourced from the pre-specified pooled analyses of ZOE-50 and ZOE-\n70 (mTVC) as these analyses provide the most robust estimates for vaccine efficacy in this age group. \n\n \nApproximately 13,000 subjects with underlying medical conditions, including conditions associated \nwith a higher risk of HZ, were enrolled in ZOE-50 and ZOE-70.

A further reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with confirmed HZ could not be \ndemonstrated due to the limited number of HZ cases in the vaccine group. \n \nIn the fourth year after vaccination, the efficacy against HZ was 93.1 % (95% CI: 81.2; 98.2) and \n87.9% (95% CI: 73.3; 95.4) in adults ≥ 50 years and adults ≥ 70 years, respectively. \nThe duration of protection beyond 4 years is currently under investigation. \n \nEfficacy against HZ-related complications other than PHN \n \nThe evaluated HZ-related complications were: HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic \ndisease, neurologic disease, visceral disease, and stroke. In the pooled analysis of ZOE-50 and ZOE-\n70, Shingrix significantly reduced these HZ-related complications by 93.7% (95% CI: 59.5; 99.9) and \n91.6% (95% CI: 43.3; 99.8) in adults ≥ 50 years (1 vs. 16 cases) and adults ≥ 70 years (1 vs. 12 cases), \nrespectively. No cases of visceral disease or stroke were reported during these studies. \n \nEffect of Shingrix on HZ-related pain \n \nOverall there was a general trend towards less severe HZ-related pain in subjects vaccinated with \nShingrix compared to placebo. As a consequence of the high vaccine efficacy against HZ, a low \nnumber of breakthrough cases were accrued, and it was therefore not possible to draw firm \nconclusions on these study objectives. \n \nIn subjects ≥ 70 years with at least one confirmed HZ episode (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled), Shingrix \nsignificantly reduced the use and the duration of HZ-related pain medication by 39.0% (95% CI: 11.9; \n63.3) and 50.6% (95% CI: 8.8; 73.2), respectively. The median duration of pain medication use was \n32.0 and 44.0 days in the Shingrix and placebo group, respectively. \n \nIn subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode, Shingrix significantly reduced the maximum \naverage pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ episode (mean = 3.9 vs. 5.5, P-value = 0.049 and \nmean = 4.5 vs. 5.6, P-value = 0.043, in subjects ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50) and ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and \nZOE-70 pooled), respectively). In addition, in subjects ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled), \nShingrix significantly reduced the maximum worst pain score versus placebo over the entire HZ \nepisode (mean = 5.7 vs. 7.0, P-value = 0.032). \n \nThe burden-of-illness (BOI) score incorporates the incidence of HZ with the severity and duration of \nacute and chronic HZ-related pain over a 6 month period following rash onset. \nThe efficacy in reducing BOI was 98.4% (95% CI: 92.2; 100) in subjects ≥ 50 years (ZOE-50) and \n92.1% (95% CI: 90.4; 93.8) in subjects ≥ 70 years (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 pooled). \n \nImmunogenicity of Shingrix \n \nAn immunological correlate of protection has not been established; therefore the level of immune \nresponse that provides protection against HZ is unknown. \n \nThe immune responses to Shingrix were evaluated in a subset of subjects from the phase III efficacy \nstudies ZOE-50 [humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (CMI)] and ZOE-70 (humoral \n\n\n\n9 \n\nimmunity). Shingrix elicited higher gE-specific immune responses (humoral and CMI) at 1 month \npost-dose 2 when compared to pre-vaccination levels. \n \nThe humoral immunogenicity and CMI results are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. \n \nTable 3: Humoral immunogenicity of Shingrix in adults ≥ 50 years (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) \n \n\nAnti-gE immune response^ \n\nAge \ngroup \n(years) \n\nMonth 3* Month 38** \n\nN GMC (mIU/ml) (95% CI) \n\nMedian fold \nincrease of \n\nconcentrations \nvs. pre-\n\nvaccination  \n(Q1; Q3) \n\nN GMC (mIU/ml) (95% CI) \n\nMedian fold \nincrease of \n\nconcentrations \nvs. pre-\n\nvaccination \n(Q1; Q3) \n\nZOE-50 \n\n≥ 50 1,070 52,376.6 (50,264.1; 54,577.9) \n41.9 \n\n(20.8; 86.9) 967 \n11,919.6 \n\n(11,345.6; 12,522.7) \n9.3 \n\n(4.9; 19.5) \nPooled ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 \n\n≥ 70 742 49,691.5 (47,250.8; 52,258.2) \n34.3 \n\n(16.7; 68.5) 648 \n10,507.7 \n\n(9,899.2; 11,153.6) \n7.2 \n\n(3.5; 14.5) \nATP  According-To-Protocol \n^ Anti-gE immune response = anti-gE antibody levels, measured by anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent \n\nassay (gE ELISA) \n* Month 3   = 1 month post-dose 2 \n** Month 38 = 3 years post-dose 2 \nN Number of evaluable subjects at the specified time point (for the GMC) \nCI Confidence interval \nGMC Geometric Mean Concentration \nQ1; Q3 First and third quartiles \n \nTable 4: Cell-mediated immunogenicity of Shingrix in adults ≥ 50 years (ATP cohort for\n immunogenicity) \n \n\ngE-specific CD4[2+] T cell response^ \n\nAge \ngroup \n(years) \n\nMonth 3* Month 38** \n\nN \nMedian \n\nfrequency \n(Q1; Q3) \n\n \n\nMedian fold \nincrease of \n\nfrequency vs. pre-\nvaccination \n\n(Q1; Q3) \n\nN \nMedian \n\nfrequency \n(Q1; Q3) \n\nMedian fold \nincrease of \n\nfrequency vs.  \npre-vaccination \n\n(Q1; Q3) \nZOE-50 \n\n≥ 50 164 1,844.1 (1,253.6; 2,932.3) \n24.6 \n\n(9.9; 744.2) 152 \n738.9 \n\n(355.7; 1,206.5) \n7.9 \n\n(2.7; 31.6) \n\n≥ 70*** 52 1,494.6 (922.9; 2,067.1) \n33.2 \n\n(10.0; 1,052.0) 46 \n480.2 \n\n(196.1; 972.4) \n7.3 \n\n(1.7; 31.6) \nATP  According-To-Protocol \n^ gE-specific CD4[2+] T cell response = gE-specific CD4+ T cell activity, measured by intracellular \n\ncytokine staining (ICS) assay  (CD4[2+] T cells = CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 of 4 selected \nimmune markers) \n\n* Month 3   = 1 month post-dose 2 \n** Month 38 = 3 years post-dose 2 \nN  Number of evaluable subjects at the specified time point \nQ1; Q3 First and third quartiles \n*** The gE-specific CD4[2+] data in the ≥70 years of age group were generated in ZOE-50 because CD4+ T \n\ncell activity was not assessed in ZOE-70 \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nData from a phase II, open-label, single group, follow-up clinical study in adults ≥ 60 years (Zoster-\n024) indicate that the vaccine-induced immune response (humoral and CMI) persists up to \napproximately 6 years following a 0, 2-month schedule (N= 119). The median anti-gE antibody \nconcentration was greater than 7-fold above the baseline pre-vaccination median concentration. The \nmedian frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells was greater than 3.7-fold above baseline pre-\nvaccination median frequency. \n \nImmunogenicity in subjects receiving 2 doses of Shingrix 6 months apart \n \nEfficacy has not been assessed for the 0, 6-month schedule. \nIn a phase III, open-label clinical study (Zoster-026) where 238 adults ≥ 50 years of age were equally \nrandomised to receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 or 6 months apart, the humoral immune response \nfollowing the 0, 6-month schedule was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the response with the 0, 2-\nmonth schedule. The anti-gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 38,153.7 mIU/ml (95% \nCI: 34,205.8; 42,557.3) and 44,376.3 mIU/ml (95% CI: 39,697.0; 49,607.2) following the 0, 6-month \nschedule and the 0, 2-month schedule, respectively. \n \nSubjects with a history of HZ prior to vaccination \n \nSubjects with a history of HZ were excluded from ZOE-50 and ZOE-70. In a phase III, uncontrolled, \nopen-label clinical study (Zoster-033), 96 adults ≥ 50 years of age with a physician-documented \nhistory of HZ received 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart. Laboratory confirmation of HZ cases was \nnot part of the study procedures. The anti-gE GMC at 1 month after the last vaccine dose was 47,758.7 \nmIU/ml (95% CI: 42,258.8; 53,974.4). \nThere were 9 reports of suspected HZ in 6 subjects over a one-year follow up period. This is a higher \nrecurrence rate than generally reported in observational studies in unvaccinated individuals with a \nhistory of HZ. (See section 4.4) \n \nImmunocompromised subjects \n \nTwo phase I/II clinical studies, Zoster-001 and Zoster-015, were conducted in subjects with \nautologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant or HIV infection. A total of 135 adults, of whom 73 \nwere ≥50 years of age, received at least one dose of Shingrix, which was shown to be immunogenic \nand well-tolerated. \n \nImmunogenicity in individuals previously vaccinated with live attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine \n \nIn a phase III, open-label, multicentre clinical study (Zoster-048), a 2 dose schedule of Shingrix 2 \nmonths apart was assessed in 215 adults ≥ 65 years of age with a previous history of vaccination with \nlive attenuated HZ vaccine ≥ 5 years earlier compared to 215 matched subjects who had never \nreceived live attenuated HZ vaccine. The immune response to Shingrix was unaffected by prior \nvaccination with live attenuated HZ vaccine. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nShingrix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of Varicella Zoster Virus \nreactivation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute and \nrepeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, cardiovascular/respiratory safety pharmacology and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \n \n6.

Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Shingrix  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Shingrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Shingrix is used for \nShingrix is a vaccine that helps to protect adults against shingles (herpes zoster) and post-herpetic \nneuralgia (PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles. \n \nShingrix is given to adults 50 years and above. \n \nShingrix cannot be used to prevent chickenpox (varicella). \n \nWhat shingles is \n• Shingles is a rash with blisters that is often painful. It usually occurs in one part of the body and \n\ncan last for several weeks. \n• Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.  \n• After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. \n• Sometimes, after many years, if your immune system (the body’s natural defences) becomes \n\nweaker (due to age, an illness or a medicine you are taking), the virus can cause shingles. \n \nComplications related to shingles \nShingles may lead to complications.  \nThe most common complication of shingles is: \n• long-lasting nerve pain – called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. After the shingles blisters heal, \n\nyou may get pain which can last for months or years and may be severe. \nOther complications of shingles are: \n• scars where the blisters have been. \n• skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis and loss of hearing or vision – these are less \n\ncommon. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHow Shingrix works \nShingrix reminds your body about the virus that causes shingles. This helps your immune system (the \nbody’s natural defences) stay prepared to fight the virus and protect you against shingles and its \ncomplications. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Shingrix  \n \nYou should not receive Shingrix if \n• you are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\nYou should not receive Shingrix if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Shingrix if: \n• you have a severe infection with a high temperature (fever). In these cases, the vaccination may \n\nhave to be postponed until you have recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a \nproblem, but talk to your doctor first; \n\n• you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you \nreceive Shingrix. \n \nFainting can occur before or after any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted \nwith a previous injection. \n \nShingrix cannot be used as a treatment if you already have shingles or shingles-related complications. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Shingrix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. \n \nOther medicines and Shingrix \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or have recently received any other \nvaccine. \n \nShingrix can be given at the same time as other vaccines. A different injection site will be used for \neach vaccine. \n \nYou may be more likely to experience fever and/or shivering when 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known if Shingrix affects your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use \nmachines if you are feeling unwell. \n \nShingrix contains sodium and potassium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.  \nThis medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-\nfree’. \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n3. How Shingrix is given \n \n• Shingrix is given as an injection into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). \n• You will receive 2 injections with an interval of 2 months. If flexibility in the vaccination \n\nschedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months after the \nfirst dose. The first injection can be given from the age of 50 years onwards. \n\n• You will be informed when you should come back for the second dose of Shingrix. \n \nMake sure you finish the complete vaccination course. This will maximise the protection offered by \nShingrix. \n \nShingrix can be given if you have already been vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster \nvaccine. Speak to your doctor for more information. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects reported during clinical trials with Shingrix: \n \nVery common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): \n\n• headache \n• stomach and digestive complaints (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or stomach pain) \n• muscle pain (myalgia) \n• pain, redness and swelling where the injection is given  \n• feeling tired, chills, fever \n\n \nCommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): \n\n• itching where the injection is given (pruritus)  \n• generally feeling unwell \n\n \nUncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of vaccine) \n\n• swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin \n• joint pain \n\n \nMost of these side effects are mild to moderate in intensity and are not long-lasting. \n \nAdults aged 50-69 years may experience more side effects compared to adults aged ≥ 70 years. \n \nSide effects reported after the marketing of Shingrix: \n \nRare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine) \n\n• allergic reactions including rash, hives (urticaria), swelling of the face, tongue or throat which \nmay cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing (angioedema) \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Shingrix \n \n• Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n\n• Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). \n• Do not freeze. \n• Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n• Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
