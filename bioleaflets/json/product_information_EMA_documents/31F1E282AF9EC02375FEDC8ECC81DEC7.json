CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning in all age ranges. \n\n \n\nCyanokit is to be administered together with appropriate decontamination and supportive measures \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nInitial dose \n\nAdults: The initial dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (2 x 100 mL). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the initial dose of Cyanokit is \n\n70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nin kg \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n60 \n\nInitial dose  \n\nin g \n\nin mL \n\n \n\n0.35 \n\n14 \n\n \n\n0.70 \n\n28 \n\n \n\n1.40 \n\n56 \n\n \n\n2.10 \n\n84 \n\n \n\n2.80 \n\n112 \n\n \n\n3.50 \n\n140 \n\n \n\n4.20 \n\n168 \n\n \n\nSubsequent dose \n\nDepending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response (see section 4.4), a second \n\ndose may be administered. \n\n \n\nAdults: The subsequent dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (2 x 100 mL). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the subsequent dose of Cyanokit \n\nis 70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nMaximum dose \n\n \n\nAdults: The maximum total recommended dose is 10 g. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the maximum total recommended \n\ndose is 140 mg/kg not exceeding 10 g. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAlthough the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin have not been studied in renal and hepatic \n\nimpairments, Cyanokit is administered as emergency therapy in an acute, life-threatening situation \n\nonly and no dose adjustment is required in these patients. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInitial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. \n\n \n\nThe rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely \n\nunstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nNone. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTreatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy of \n\noxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. Consideration must \n\nbe given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. \n\n \n\nCyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above measures. \n\n \n\nThe presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely \n\navailable, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of \n\nclinical history and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.  \n\n \n\nCyanide poisoning may result from exposure to smoke from closed space fires, inhalation, ingestion, \n\nor dermal exposure. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogens, \n\nincluding cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, or prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside. \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms of cyanide poisoning \n\n \n\nCommon signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning include: nausea, vomiting, headache, altered \n\nmental status (e.g. confusion, disorientation), chest tightness, dyspnoea, tachypnoea or hyperpnoea \n\n(early), bradypnoea or apnoea (late), hypertension (early) or hypotension (late), cardiovascular \n\ncollapse, seizures or coma, mydriasis, and plasma lactate concentration > 8 mmol/L. \n\n \n\nIn the setting of multiple casualties such as terrorism or chemical disaster, panic symptoms including \n\ntachypnoea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental \n\nstatus (confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nSmoke inhalation \n\n \n\nNot all smoke inhalation victims necessarily will have cyanide poisoning, but may present with burns, \n\ntrauma, and exposure to additional toxic substances aggravating the clinical picture. Before Cyanokit \n\nis administered, it is recommended to check affected persons for the presence of the following: \n\n exposure to fire smoke in an enclosed area \n\n soot present around mouth, nose and/or oropharynx \n\n altered mental status \n\n \n\nIn this setting hypotension and/or a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (higher than the one \n\nmentioned under signs and symptoms due to the fact that carbon monoxide contributes to lactic \n\nacidaemia) are highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning. In the presence of the above signs, treatment \n\nwith Cyanokit must not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nKnown hypersensitivity to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12 must be taken into benefit-risk \n\nconsideration before administration of Cyanokit, since hypersensitive reactions may occur in patients \n\nreceiving hydroxocobalamin (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRenal disorders  \n\nOxalate crystals have been observed in the urine of healthy volunteers given hydroxocobalamin. \n\nCases of acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment and urine calcium oxalate \n\ncrystals present have been reported in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin following known or \n\nsuspected cyanide poisoning. In some situations, hemodialysis  was required to achieve recovery  (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\nTherefore, as a precaution, after Cyanokit administration, regular monitoring of renal function \n\n(including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine) should be performed until 7 days after drug \n\nonset. \n\n \n\nIncrease in blood pressure \n\n \n\nTransient, generally asymptomatic, increase in blood pressure may occur in patients receiving \n\nhydroxocobalamin. The maximal increase in blood pressure has been observed toward the end of \n\ninfusion (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nEffects on blood cyanide assay \n\n \n\nHydroxocobalamin will lower blood cyanide concentrations. While determination of blood cyanide \n\nconcentration is not required and must not delay treatment with hydroxocobalamin, it may be useful \n\nfor documenting cyanide poisoning. If a cyanide blood level determination is planned, it is \n\nrecommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of treatment with Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nInterference with burn assessment \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to induce a red colouration of the \n\nskin and therefore may interfere with burn assessment. However, skin lesions, oedema, and pain are \n\nhighly suggestive of burns. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nInterference with laboratory tests \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to interfere with determination of \n\nlaboratory parameters (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urine parameters). \n\nIn vitro tests indicate that the extent and duration of the interference is dependant on numerous factors \n\nsuch as the dose of hydroxocobalamin, analyte, analyte concentration, methodology, analyser, \n\nconcentrations of cobalamins-(III) including cyanocobalamin and partially the time between sampling \n\nand measurement. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies and pharmacokinetic data obtained in healthy volunteers the following table \n\ndescribes interference with laboratory tests that may be observed following a 5 g dose of \n\nhydroxocobalamin. Interference following a 10 g dose can be expected to last up to an additional \n\n24 hours. The extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ according to \n\nthe severity of intoxication. Results may vary considerably from one analyser to another, therefore, \n\ncaution is required when reporting and interpreting laboratory results. \n\n \n\nObserved in vitro interferences of hydroxocobalamin with laboratory tests \n\n \n\nLaboratory \n\nparameter \n\nNo interference \n\nobserved Artificially \n\nincreased* \n\nArtificially  \n\ndecreased* Unpredictable*** \n\nDuration of \n\ninterference \n\nafter a 5 g dose \n\nClinical \n\nchemistry \n\nCalcium \n\nSodium \n\nPotassium \n\nChloride \n\nUrea \n\nGamma glutamyl \n\ntransferase (GGT) \n\nCreatinine \n\nTotal and \n\nconjugate \n\nbilirubin** \n\nTriglycerides \n\nCholesterol \n\nTotal protein \n\nGlucose \n\nAlbumin \n\nAlkaline \n\nphosphatase \n\nAlanine \n\naminotransferase \n\n(ALT) \n\nAmylase \n\nPhosphate \n\nUric acid \n\nAspartate \n\naminotransferase \n\n(AST) \n\nCreatine kinase (CK) \n\nCreatine kinase \n\nisoenzym MB \n\n(CKMB) \n\nLactate dehydrogenase \n\n(LDH) \n\n24 hours with the \n\nexception of \n\nbilirubin (up to \n\n4 days) \n\nHaematology Erythrocytes \n\nHaematocrit \n\nMean corpuscular \n\nvolume (MCV) \n\nLeucocytes \n\nLymphocytes \n\nMonocytes \n\nEosinophils \n\nNeutrophils \n\nPlatelets \n\nHaemoglobin \n\n(Hb) \n\nMean \n\ncorpuscular \n\nhaemoglobin \n\n(MCH) \n\nMean \n\ncorpuscular \n\nhaemoglobin \n\nconcentration \n\n(MCHC) \n\n \n\n  12-16 hours \n\nCoagulation    Activated partial \n\nthromboplastin time \n\n(aPTT) \n\nProthrombin time (PT) \n\nQuick or INR \n\n24 hours \n\n* ≥ 10% interference observed on at least one analyser  \n\n** Artificially decreased using the diazo method \n\n*** Inconsistent results \n\nAnalysers used: ACL Futura (Instrumentation Laboratory), Axsym/Architect (Abbott), BM Coasys110 \n\n(Boehringer Mannheim), CellDyn 3700 (Abbott), Clinitek 500 (Bayer), Cobas Integra 700, 400 \n\n(Roche), Gen-S Coultronics, Hitachi 917, STA Compact, Vitros 950 (Ortho Diagnostics) \n\n \n\nHydroxocobalamin may interfere with all urine colorimetric parameters. The effects on these tests \n\ntypically last 48 hours after a 5 g dose, but may persist for longer periods. Caution is required in the \n\ninterpretation of urinary colorimetric tests for as long as chromaturia is present. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nInterference with haemodialysis \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin may cause haemodialysis machines to shut down \n\ndue to an erroneous detection of a ‘blood leak’. This should be considered before haemodialysis is \n\ninitiated in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nUse with other cyanide antidotes \n\n \n\nThe safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Cyanokit has not been \n\nestablished (see section 6.2). If the decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with \n\nCyanokit, these medicinal products must not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous \n\nline (see section 6.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have shown teratogenic effects following daily exposure throughout organogenesis \n\n(see section 5.3). There are no adequate data from the use of hydroxocobalamin in pregnant women \n\nand the potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n\nHowever, taken into account: \n\n- that no more than two injections of hydroxocobalamin are to be administered, \n\n- the potentially life threatening condition, \n\n- the lack of alternative treatment, \n\nhydroxocobalamin may be given to a pregnant woman. \n\n \n\nIn case of known pregnancy at the time of treatment with Cyanokit or in case that pregnancy becomes \n\nknown after treatment with Cyanokit, health care professionals are requested to promptly report the \n\nexposure during pregnancy to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and/or Health Authorities and to \n\ncarefully follow-up on the pregnancy and its outcome. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nBecause hydroxocobalamin will be administered in potentially life-threatening situations, breast-\n\nfeeding is not a contraindication to its use. In the absence of data in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding \n\ndiscontinuation is recommended after receiving Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo studies on fertility have been performed (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nA total of 347 subjects were exposed to hydroxocobalamin in clinical studies. Of these 347 subjects, \n\n245 patients had suspected exposure to cyanide at the time of hydroxocobalamin administration. The \n\nremaining 102 subjects were healthy volunteers who had not been exposed to cyanide at the time of \n\nhydroxocobalamin administration. \n\n \n\nList of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported in association with Cyanokit use. However, \n\nbecause of the limitations of the available data, it is not possible to apply frequency estimations: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n \n\nDecrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions including angioneurotic oedema, skin eruption, urticaria and pruritus. \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n \n\nRestlessness. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n \n\nMemory impairment; dizziness. \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n\n \n\nSwelling, irritation, redness.  \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nVentricular extrasystoles. An increase in heart rate was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. \n\n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n \n\nTransient increase in blood pressure, usually resolving within several hours; hot flush. A decrease in \n\nblood pressure was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n \n\nPleural effusion, dyspnoea, throat tightness, dry throat, chest discomfort. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nAbdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n \n\nReversible red colouration of the skin and mucous membranes : most patients will experience it up to \n\n15 days after administration of Cyanokit. \n\nPustular rashes, which may last for several weeks, affecting mainly the face and the neck. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n \n\n Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment, urine calcium oxalate crystals \n\npresent (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n Chromaturia : all patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the \n\nfirst three days following administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after \n\nadministration of Cyanokit (see section 4.4 ). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n \n\nHeadache; injection site reaction; peripheral oedema. \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\n \n\nCyanokit may cause red discolouration of the plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or \n\nreduction in the levels of certain laboratory parameters (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nLimited data on children (0 to 18 years old) treated with hydroxocobalamin did not show any \n\ndifference in the safety profile of hydroxocobalamin between adults and children. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nDoses as high as 15 g have been administered without reported specific dose related adverse \n\nreactions. If overdose occurs, treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. Haemodialysis \n\nmay be effective in such a circumstance, but is only indicated in the event of significant \n\nhydroxocobalamin-related toxicity. However, hydroxocobalamin because of its deep red colour may \n\ninterfere with the performance of haemodialysis machines (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antidotes, ATC code: V03AB33 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThe action of hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide poisoning is based on its ability to tightly \n\nbind cyanide ions. Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion by substituting the \n\nhydroxo ligand linked to the trivalent cobalt ion to form cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is a stable, \n\nnon-toxic compound that is excreted in the urine.  \n\n \n\nEfficacy \n\n \n\nDue to ethical considerations, no controlled human efficacy studies have been performed.  \n\n \n\n Animal pharmacology \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin was examined in a controlled study in cyanide-poisoned adult \n\ndogs. Dogs were poisoned by intravenous administration of a lethal dose of potassium cyanide. Dogs \n\nthen received sodium chloride 9 mg/mL, 75 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin, administered \n\nintravenously over 7.5 minutes. The 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg doses are approximately equivalent to \n\n5 g and 10 g of hydroxocobalamin, respectively, in humans, not only on a body weight basis but also \n\non Cmax basis of hydroxocobalamin [total cobalamins-(III), see section 5.2]. \n\n \n\nSurvival at hour 4 and at day 14 was significantly greater in 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg \n\nhydroxocobalamin dose groups compared with dogs receiving sodium chloride 9 mg/mL alone: \n\n \n\nSurvival of cyanide-poisoned dogs \n\n \n\nParameter \n\nTreatment \n\nSodium chloride \n\n9 mg/mL \n\n(N=17) \n\nHydroxocobalamin \n\n75 mg/kg \n\n(N=19) \n\n150 mg/kg \n\n(N=18) \n\nSurvival at Hour 4, N (%) 7 (41) 18 (95)* 18 (100)* \n\nSurvival at Day 14, N (%) 3 (18) 15 (79)* 18 (100)* \n* p< 0.025 \n\n \n\nHistopathology revealed brain lesions that were consistent with cyanide-induced hypoxia. The \n\nincidence of brain lesions was markedly lower in dogs having received 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin \n\nthan in dogs having received 75 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL. \n\n \n\nThe rapid and complete recovery of haemodynamics and subsequently of blood gases, pH, and lactate \n\nafter cyanide poisoning likely contributed to the better outcome of the hydroxocobalamin-treated \n\nanimals. Hydroxocobalamin reduced whole blood cyanide concentrations from about 120 nmol/mL to \n\n30-40 nmol/mL by the end of the infusion compared with 70 nmol/mL in dogs receiving sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL alone. \n\n \n\n Cyanide-poisoned patients \n\n \n\nA total of 245 patients with suspected or known cyanide-poisoning were included in the clinical \n\nstudies of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin as an antidote. Of the 213 patients in whom the outcome \n\nwas known the survival was 58%. Of the 89 patients who died, 63 were initially found in cardiac \n\narrest, suggesting that many of these patients had almost certainly suffered irreparable brain injury \n\nprior to administration of hydroxocobalamin. Among 144 patients not in initial cardiac arrest whose \n\noutcomes were known, 118 (82%) survived. Furthermore, in 34 patients with known cyanide \n\nconcentrations above the lethal threshold (≥ 100 µmol/L), 21 (62%) survived following treatment with \n\nhydroxocobalamin. \n\nAdministration of hydroxocobalamin was generally associated with a normalisation of blood pressure \n\n(systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) in 17 of 21 patients (81%) who had low blood pressure (systolic \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nblood pressure > 0 and ≤ 90 mmHg) after exposure to cyanide. Where neurological assessment over \n\ntime was possible, (96 patients of the 171 patients who presented with neurological symptoms prior to \n\nhydroxocobalamin administration), 51 (53%) patients receiving hydroxocobalamin showed \n\nimprovement or a complete restoration.  \n\n \n\n Elderly \n\n \n\nApproximately 50 known or suspected cyanide victims aged 65 or older received hydroxocobalamin \n\nin clinical studies. In general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in these patients was similar to \n\nthat of younger patients. \n\n \n\n Paediatric population \n\n \n\nDocumentation on efficacy is available for 54 paediatric patients. The mean age of the paediatric \n\npatients was about six years and the mean dose of hydroxocobalamin was about 120 mg/kg body \n\nweight. The survival rate of 41% depended very much on the clinical situation. Out of the \n\n20 paediatric patients without initial cardiac arrest, 18 (90%) survived, of whom 4 with sequelae. In \n\ngeneral, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in paediatric patients was similar to that of adults. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFollowing intravenous administration of Cyanokit, significant binding to plasma proteins and low \n\nmolecular weight physiological compounds occurs, to form various cobalamin-(III) complexes by \n\nreplacing the hydroxo ligand. The low molecular weight cobalamins-(III) formed including \n\nhydroxocobalamin are termed free cobalamins-(III); the sum of free and protein-bound cobalamins is \n\ntermed total cobalamins-(III). In order to reflect the exposure to the sum of all derivatives, \n\npharmacokinetics of cobalamins-(III) were investigated instead of hydroxocobalamin, requiring the \n\nconcentration unit µg eq/mL (i.e. cobalamin-(III) entity without specific ligand). \n\n \n\nDose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed following single dose intravenous administration \n\nof 2.5 to 10 g of Cyanokit in healthy volunteers. Mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of \n\n113 and 579 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following a dose of 5 g Cyanokit (the \n\nrecommended initial dose). Similarly, mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 197 and \n\n995 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following the dose of 10 g Cyanokit. The predominant \n\nmean half-life of free and total cobalamins-(III) was approximately 26 to 31 hours at the 5 and 10 g \n\ndose level. \n\n \n\nThe mean total amount of cobalamins-(III) excreted in urine during the collection period of 72 hours \n\nwas approximately 60% of a 5 g dose and approximately 50% of a 10 g dose of Cyanokit. Overall, the \n\ntotal urinary excretion was calculated to be at least 60 to 70% of the administered dose. The majority \n\nof the urinary excretion occurred during the first 24 hours, but red coloured urine was observed for up \n\nto 35 days following the intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nWhen normalized for body weight, male and female subjects revealed no major differences in plasma \n\nand urinary pharmacokinetic parameters of free and total cobalamins-(III) following the \n\nadministration of 5 g or 10 g Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nIn cyanide-poisoned patients, hydroxocobalamin is expected to bind cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, \n\nwhich is excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of total cobalamins-(III) in this population may \n\nbe affected by the body's cyanide load, since cyanocobalamin was reported to exhibit a 2-3 times \n\nlower half-life than total cobalamins-(III) in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn anaesthetised rabbits, hydroxocobalamin exerted haemodynamic effects (increased mean arterial \n\nblood pressure and total peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output) related to its nitric oxide-\n\nscavenging property. \n\n \n\nNo special hazard for humans was identified based on conventional studies of single and repeated \n\ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. The liver and kidney were found to be the major target organs. \n\nHowever findings were only seen at exposure levels considered being higher than the maximum \n\nhuman exposure, indicating limited relevance to clinical use. In particular, liver fibrosis was observed \n\nin dogs after administration of hydroxocobalamin for 4 weeks at 300 mg/kg. The relevance of this \n\nfinding to humans is unlikely since it was not reported in short-term studies conducted with \n\nhydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, was observed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of \n\n150 mg/kg and higher administered daily throughout organogenesis. The dose of 150 mg/kg \n\napproximately corresponds to the maximum recommended human dose. \n\n \n\nNo data are available on male and female fertility as well as on peri- and postnatal development. \n\nHydroxocobalamin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nHydrochloric acid (for pH-adjustment) \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nPhysical incompatibility (particle formation) was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin \n\nreconstituted solution and the following medicinal products: diazepam, dobutamine, dopamine, \n\nfentanyl, nitroglycerin, pentobarbital, phenytoin sodium, propofol and thiopental.  \n\n \n\nChemical incompatibility was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin reconstituted solution \n\nand the following medicinal products: epinephrine, lidocaine hydrochloride, adenosine, atropine, \n\nmidazolam, ketamin, succinylcholine chloride, amiodarone hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, \n\nsodium thiosulfate, sodium nitrite, and has been reported with ascorbic acid.  \n\nConsequently, these and other medicinal products must not be administered simultaneously through \n\nthe same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nSimultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, \n\nplatelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended.  \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\n3 years. \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of ambulatory use, Cyanokit may be exposed during short periods to the temperature \n\nvariations of usual transport (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 40°C), transport \n\nin the desert (4 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 60°C) and freezing/defrosting \n\ncycles (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from -20°C to 40°C). If these temporary conditions \n\nhave been exceeded, the product should be discarded. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) has been demonstrated for 6 hours at a temperature between 2°C and 40°C.  \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \n\nwould normally not be longer than 6 hours at 2°C to 8ºC. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nDo not store above 25°C. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\nType II colourless 250 mL glass vial closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium cap \n\nwith a plastic lid.  \n\nEach pack contains two vials (each vial packed in one cardboard box), two sterile transfer devices, \n\none sterile intravenous infusion set and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nNo special requirements for disposal. \n\n \n\nEach vial is to be reconstituted with 100 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device.  \n\nSodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or \n\nglucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  \n\n \n\nThe Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 30 seconds to mix the solution. It must not be \n\nshaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. \n\nBecause the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. \n\nThe intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter \n\nand is to be primed with the reconstituted solution. Repeat this procedure if necessary with the second \n\nvial. \n\n \n\n \n\n7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n\n \n\nSERB S.A. \n\nAvenue Louise 480  \n\n1050 Brussels \n\nBelgium \n\n \n\n \n\n8.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning in all age ranges. \n\n \n\nCyanokit is to be administered together with appropriate decontamination and supportive measures \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nInitial dose \n\nAdults: The initial dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (200 mL, complete volume of reconstituted solution). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the initial dose of Cyanokit is \n\n70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nin kg \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n60 \n\nInitial dose  \n\nin g \n\nin mL \n\n \n\n0.35 \n\n14 \n\n \n\n0.70 \n\n28 \n\n \n\n1.40 \n\n56 \n\n \n\n2.10 \n\n84 \n\n \n\n2.80 \n\n112 \n\n \n\n3.50 \n\n140 \n\n \n\n4.20 \n\n168 \n\n \n\nSubsequent dose \n\nDepending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response (see section 4.4), a second \n\ndose may be administered. \n\n \n\nAdults: The subsequent dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (200 mL, complete volume of reconstituted solution). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the subsequent dose of Cyanokit \n\nis 70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nMaximum dose \n\n \n\nAdults: The maximum total recommended dose is 10 g. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the maximum total recommended \n\ndose is 140 mg/kg not exceeding 10 g. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAlthough the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin have not been studied in renal and hepatic \n\nimpairments, Cyanokit is administered as emergency therapy in an acute, life-threatening situation \n\nonly and no dose adjustment is required in these patients. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInitial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. \n\n \n\nThe rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely \n\nunstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nNone. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTreatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy of \n\noxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. Consideration must \n\nbe given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. \n\n \n\nCyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above measures. \n\n \n\nThe presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely \n\navailable, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of \n\nclinical history and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.  \n\n \n\nCyanide poisoning may result from exposure to smoke from closed space fires, inhalation, ingestion, \n\nor dermal exposure. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogens, \n\nincluding cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, or prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside. \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms of cyanide poisoning \n\n \n\nCommon signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning include: nausea, vomiting, headache, altered \n\nmental status (e.g. confusion, disorientation), chest tightness, dyspnoea, tachypnoea or hyperpnoea \n\n(early), bradypnoea or apnoea (late), hypertension (early) or hypotension (late), cardiovascular \n\ncollapse, seizures or coma, mydriasis, and plasma lactate concentration > 8 mmol/L. \n\n \n\nIn the setting of multiple casualties such as terrorism or chemical disaster, panic symptoms including \n\ntachypnoea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental \n\nstatus (confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nSmoke inhalation \n\n \n\nNot all smoke inhalation victims necessarily will have cyanide poisoning, but may present with burns, \n\ntrauma, and exposure to additional toxic substances aggravating the clinical picture. Before Cyanokit \n\nis administered, it is recommended to check affected persons for the presence of the following: \n\n exposure to fire smoke in an enclosed area \n\n soot present around mouth, nose and/or oropharynx \n\n altered mental status \n\n \n\nIn this setting hypotension and/or a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (higher than the one \n\nmentioned under signs and symptoms due to the fact that carbon monoxide contributes to lactic \n\nacidaemia) are highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning. In the presence of the above signs, treatment \n\nwith Cyanokit must not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration. \n\n \n\nRenal disorders \n\n \n\nOxalate crystals have been observed in the urine of healthy volunteers given hydroxocobalamin. \n\nCases of acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment and urine calcium oxalate \n\ncrystals present have been reported in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin following known or \n\nsuspected cyanide poisoning. In some situations, hemodialysis was required to achieve recovery  (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\nTherefore, as a precaution, after Cyanokit administration, regular monitoring of renal function \n\n(including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine)  should be performed until 7 days after drug \n\nonset. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nKnown hypersensitivity to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12 must be taken into benefit-risk \n\nconsideration before administration of Cyanokit, since hypersensitive reactions may occur in patients \n\nreceiving hydroxocobalamin (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIncrease in blood pressure \n\n \n\nTransient, generally asymptomatic, increase in blood pressure may occur in patients receiving \n\nhydroxocobalamin. The maximal increase in blood pressure has been observed toward the end of \n\ninfusion (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nEffects on blood cyanide assay \n\n \n\nHydroxocobalamin will lower blood cyanide concentrations. While determination of blood cyanide \n\nconcentration is not required and must not delay treatment with hydroxocobalamin, it may be useful \n\nfor documenting cyanide poisoning. If a cyanide blood level determination is planned, it is \n\nrecommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of treatment with Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nInterference with burn assessment \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to induce a red colouration of the \n\nskin and therefore may interfere with burn assessment. However, skin lesions, oedema, and pain are \n\nhighly suggestive of burns. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nInterference with laboratory tests \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to interfere with determination of \n\nlaboratory parameters (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urine parameters). \n\nIn vitro tests indicate that the extent and duration of the interference is dependant on numerous factors \n\nsuch as the dose of hydroxocobalamin, analyte, analyte concentration, methodology, analyser, \n\nconcentrations of cobalamins-(III) including cyanocobalamin and partially the time between sampling \n\nand measurement. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies and pharmacokinetic data obtained in healthy volunteers the following table \n\ndescribes interference with laboratory tests that may be observed following a 5 g dose of \n\nhydroxocobalamin. Interference following a 10 g dose can be expected to last up to an additional \n\n24 hours. The extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ according to \n\nthe severity of intoxication.

Caution is required in the \n\ninterpretation of urinary colorimetric tests for as long as chromaturia is present. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nInterference with haemodialysis \n\n \n\nBecause of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin may cause haemodialysis machines to shut down \n\ndue to an erroneous detection of a ‘blood leak’. This should be considered before haemodialysis is \n\ninitiated in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nUse with other cyanide antidotes \n\n \n\nThe safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Cyanokit has not been \n\nestablished (see section 6.2). If the decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with \n\nCyanokit, these medicinal products must not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous \n\nline (see section 6.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have shown teratogenic effects following daily exposure throughout organogenesis \n\n(see section 5.3). There are no adequate data from the use of hydroxocobalamin in pregnant women \n\nand the potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n\nHowever, taken into account: \n\n- that no more than two injections of hydroxocobalamin are to be administered, \n\n- the potentially life threatening condition, \n\n- the lack of alternative treatment, \n\nhydroxocobalamin may be given to a pregnant woman. \n\n \n\nIn case of known pregnancy at the time of treatment with Cyanokit or in case that pregnancy becomes \n\nknown after treatment with Cyanokit, health care professionals are requested to promptly report the \n\nexposure during pregnancy to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and/or Health Authorities and to \n\ncarefully follow-up on the pregnancy and its outcome. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nBecause hydroxocobalamin will be administered in potentially life-threatening situations, breast-\n\nfeeding is not a contraindication to its use. In the absence of data in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding \n\ndiscontinuation is recommended after receiving Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo studies on fertility have been performed (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nA total of 347 subjects were exposed to hydroxocobalamin in clinical studies. Of these 347 subjects, \n\n245 patients had suspected exposure to cyanide at the time of hydroxocobalamin administration. The \n\nremaining 102 subjects were healthy volunteers who had not been exposed to cyanide at the time of \n\nhydroxocobalamin administration. \n\n \n\nList of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported in association with Cyanokit use. However, \n\nbecause of the limitations of the available data, it is not possible to apply frequency estimations: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n \n\nDecrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions including angioneurotic oedema, skin eruption, urticaria and pruritus. \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n \n\nRestlessness. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n \n\nMemory impairment; dizziness. \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n\n \n\nSwelling, irritation, redness.  \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nVentricular extrasystoles. An increase in heart rate was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. \n\n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n \n\nTransient increase in blood pressure, usually resolving within several hours; hot flush. A decrease in \n\nblood pressure was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n \n\nPleural effusion, dyspnoea, throat tightness, dry throat, chest discomfort. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nAbdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n \n\nReversible red colouration of the skin and mucous membranes: most patients will experience it up to \n\n15 days after administration of Cyanokit. \n\nPustular rashes, which may last for several weeks, affecting mainly the face and the neck. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n \n\n Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment, urine calcium oxalate crystals \n\npresent (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n Chromaturia: all patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the first \n\nthree days following administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after administration of \n\nCyanokit (see section 4.4).   \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n \n\nHeadache; injection site reaction; peripheral oedema. \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\n \n\nCyanokit may cause red discolouration of the plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or \n\nreduction in the levels of certain laboratory parameters (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nLimited data on children (0 to 18 years old) treated with hydroxocobalamin did not show any \n\ndifference in the safety profile of hydroxocobalamin between adults and children. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nDoses as high as 15 g have been administered without reported specific dose related adverse \n\nreactions. If overdose occurs, treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. Haemodialysis \n\nmay be effective in such a circumstance, but is only indicated in the event of significant \n\nhydroxocobalamin-related toxicity. However, hydroxocobalamin because of its deep red colour may \n\ninterfere with the performance of haemodialysis machines (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antidotes, ATC code: V03AB33 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThe action of hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide poisoning is based on its ability to tightly \n\nbind cyanide ions. Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion by substituting the \n\nhydroxo ligand linked to the trivalent cobalt ion to form cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is a stable, \n\nnon-toxic compound that is excreted in the urine.  \n\n \n\nEfficacy \n\n \n\nDue to ethical considerations, no controlled human efficacy studies have been performed.  \n\n \n\n Animal pharmacology \n\n \n\nThe effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin was examined in a controlled study in cyanide-poisoned adult \n\ndogs. Dogs were poisoned by intravenous administration of a lethal dose of potassium cyanide. Dogs \n\nthen received sodium chloride 9 mg/mL, 75 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin, administered \n\nintravenously over 7.5 minutes. The 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg doses are approximately equivalent to \n\n5 g and 10 g of hydroxocobalamin, respectively, in humans, not only on a body weight basis but also \n\non Cmax basis of hydroxocobalamin [total cobalamins-(III), see section 5.2]. \n\n \n\nSurvival at hour 4 and at day 14 was significantly greater in 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg \n\nhydroxocobalamin dose groups compared with dogs receiving sodium chloride 9 mg/mL alone: \n\n \n\nSurvival of cyanide-poisoned dogs \n\n \n\nParameter \n\nTreatment \n\nSodium chloride \n\n9 mg/mL \n\n(N=17) \n\nHydroxocobalamin \n\n75 mg/kg \n\n(N=19) \n\n150 mg/kg \n\n(N=18) \n\nSurvival at Hour 4, N (%) 7 (41) 18 (95)* 18 (100)* \n\nSurvival at Day 14, N (%) 3 (18) 15 (79)* 18 (100)* \n* p< 0.025 \n\n \n\nHistopathology revealed brain lesions that were consistent with cyanide-induced hypoxia. The \n\nincidence of brain lesions was markedly lower in dogs having received 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin \n\nthan in dogs having received 75 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL. \n\n \n\nThe rapid and complete recovery of haemodynamics and subsequently of blood gases, pH, and lactate \n\nafter cyanide poisoning likely contributed to the better outcome of the hydroxocobalamin-treated \n\nanimals. Hydroxocobalamin reduced whole blood cyanide concentrations from about 120 nmol/mL to \n\n30-40 nmol/mL by the end of the infusion compared with 70 nmol/mL in dogs receiving sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL alone. \n\n \n\n Cyanide-poisoned patients \n\n \n\nA total of 245 patients with suspected or known cyanide-poisoning were included in the clinical \n\nstudies of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin as an antidote. Of the 213 patients in whom the outcome \n\nwas known the survival was 58%. Of the 89 patients who died, 63 were initially found in cardiac \n\narrest, suggesting that many of these patients had almost certainly suffered irreparable brain injury \n\nprior to administration of hydroxocobalamin. Among 144 patients not in initial cardiac arrest whose \n\noutcomes were known, 118 (82%) survived. Furthermore, in 34 patients with known cyanide \n\nconcentrations above the lethal threshold (≥ 100 µmol/L), 21 (62%) survived following treatment with \n\nhydroxocobalamin. \n\nAdministration of hydroxocobalamin was generally associated with a normalisation of blood pressure \n\n(systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) in 17 of 21 patients (81%) who had low blood pressure (systolic \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nblood pressure > 0 and ≤ 90 mmHg) after exposure to cyanide. Where neurological assessment over \n\ntime was possible, (96 patients of the 171 patients who presented with neurological symptoms prior to \n\nhydroxocobalamin administration), 51 (53%) patients receiving hydroxocobalamin showed \n\nimprovement or a complete restoration.  \n\n \n\n Elderly \n\n \n\nApproximately 50 known or suspected cyanide victims aged 65 or older received hydroxocobalamin \n\nin clinical studies. In general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in these patients was similar to \n\nthat of younger patients. \n\n \n\n Paediatric population \n\n \n\nDocumentation on efficacy is available for 54 paediatric patients. The mean age of the paediatric \n\npatients was about six years and the mean dose of hydroxocobalamin was about 120 mg/kg body \n\nweight. The survival rate of 41% depended very much on the clinical situation. Out of the \n\n20 paediatric patients without initial cardiac arrest, 18 (90%) survived, of whom 4 with sequelae. In \n\ngeneral, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in paediatric patients was similar to that of adults. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFollowing intravenous administration of Cyanokit, significant binding to plasma proteins and low \n\nmolecular weight physiological compounds occurs, to form various cobalamin-(III) complexes by \n\nreplacing the hydroxo ligand. The low molecular weight cobalamins-(III) formed including \n\nhydroxocobalamin are termed free cobalamins-(III); the sum of free and protein-bound cobalamins is \n\ntermed total cobalamins-(III). In order to reflect the exposure to the sum of all derivatives, \n\npharmacokinetics of cobalamins-(III) were investigated instead of hydroxocobalamin, requiring the \n\nconcentration unit µg eq/mL (i.e. cobalamin-(III) entity without specific ligand). \n\n \n\nDose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed following single dose intravenous administration \n\nof 2.5 to 10 g of Cyanokit in healthy volunteers. Mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of \n\n113 and 579 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following a dose of 5 g Cyanokit (the \n\nrecommended initial dose). Similarly, mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 197 and \n\n995 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following the dose of 10 g Cyanokit. The predominant \n\nmean half-life of free and total cobalamins-(III) was approximately 26 to 31 hours at the 5 and 10 g \n\ndose level. \n\n \n\nThe mean total amount of cobalamins-(III) excreted in urine during the collection period of 72 hours \n\nwas approximately 60% of a 5 g dose and approximately 50% of a 10 g dose of Cyanokit. Overall, the \n\ntotal urinary excretion was calculated to be at least 60 to 70% of the administered dose. The majority \n\nof the urinary excretion occurred during the first 24 hours, but red coloured urine was observed for up \n\nto 35 days following the intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nWhen normalized for body weight, male and female subjects revealed no major differences in plasma \n\nand urinary pharmacokinetic parameters of free and total cobalamins-(III) following the \n\nadministration of 5 g or 10 g Cyanokit. \n\n \n\nIn cyanide-poisoned patients, hydroxocobalamin is expected to bind cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, \n\nwhich is excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of total cobalamins-(III) in this population may \n\nbe affected by the body's cyanide load, since cyanocobalamin was reported to exhibit a 2-3 times \n\nlower half-life than total cobalamins-(III) in healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn anaesthetised rabbits, hydroxocobalamin exerted haemodynamic effects (increased mean arterial \n\nblood pressure and total peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output) related to its nitric oxide-\n\nscavenging property. \n\n \n\nNo special hazard for humans was identified based on conventional studies of single and repeated \n\ndose toxicity and genotoxicity. The liver and kidney were found to be the major target organs. \n\nHowever findings were only seen at exposure levels considered being higher than the maximum \n\nhuman exposure, indicating limited relevance to clinical use. In particular, liver fibrosis was observed \n\nin dogs after administration of hydroxocobalamin for 4 weeks at 300 mg/kg. The relevance of this \n\nfinding to humans is unlikely since it was not reported in short-term studies conducted with \n\nhydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, was observed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of \n\n150 mg/kg and higher administered daily throughout organogenesis. The dose of 150 mg/kg \n\napproximately corresponds to the maximum recommended human dose. \n\n \n\nNo data are available on male and female fertility as well as on peri- and postnatal development. \n\nHydroxocobalamin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nHydrochloric acid (for pH-adjustment) \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nPhysical incompatibility (particle formation) was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin \n\nreconstituted solution and the following medicinal products: diazepam, dobutamine, dopamine, \n\nfentanyl, nitroglycerin, pentobarbital, phenytoin sodium, propofol and thiopental.  \n\n \n\nChemical incompatibility was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin reconstituted solution \n\nand the following medicinal products: epinephrine, lidocaine hydrochloride, adenosine, atropine, \n\nmidazolam, ketamin, succinylcholine chloride, amiodarone hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, \n\nsodium thiosulfate, sodium nitrite, and has been reported with ascorbic acid.  \n\nConsequently, these and other medicinal products must not be administered simultaneously through \n\nthe same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nSimultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, \n\nplatelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended.  \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\n3 years. \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of ambulatory use, Cyanokit may be exposed during short periods to the temperature \n\nvariations of usual transport (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 40°C), transport \n\nin the desert (4 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 60°C) and freezing/defrosting \n\ncycles (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from -20°C to 40°C). If these temporary conditions \n\nhave been exceeded, the product should be discarded. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) has been demonstrated for 6 hours at a temperature between 2°C and 40°C.  \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used \n\nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \n\nwould normally not be longer than 6 hours at 2°C to 8ºC. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nDo not store above 25°C. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\nType I colourless 250 mL glass vial closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium cap \n\nwith a plastic lid.  \n\nEach pack contains one vial packed in one cardboard box, one sterile transfer device, one sterile \n\nintravenous infusion set and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nNo special requirements for disposal. \n\n \n\nThe vial is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. \n\nSodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or \n\nglucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  \n\n \n\nThe Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 1 minute to mix the solution. It must not be \n\nshaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. \n\nBecause the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. \n\nThe intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter \n\nand is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

What you need to know before Cyanokit is used \n\n3. How Cyanokit is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How Cyanokit is stored \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Cyanokit is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nCyanokit contains the active substance hydroxocobalamin. \n\nCyanokit is an antidote for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning in all age ranges.  \n\nCyanokit is to be administered together with appropriate decontamination and supportive measures. \n\n \n\nCyanide is a highly poisonous chemical. Cyanide poisoning may be caused by exposure to smoke \n\nfrom household and industrial fires, breathing or swallowing cyanide, or contact with cyanide on skin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before Cyanokit is used \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or other health care professional  \n\n if you are allergic to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12. They will have to take it into account \n\nbefore treating you with Cyanokit. \n\n that you have been treated with Cyanokit if you need to have the following: \n\n- any blood or urine tests. Cyanokit may modify the results of these tests. \n\n- burn assessement. Cyanokit may interfere with the assessment as it causes red coloration of \n\nthe skin. \n\n- haemodialysis. Cyanokit may lead to shut down of haemodialysis machines until it is \n\neliminated from the blood (at least 5.5 to 6.5 days). \n\nmonitoring of renal function: Cyanokit may lead to kidney failure and urine crystals. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Cyanokit \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or other health care professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take \n\nany other medicines. \n\n \n\nDetailed information for your doctor or other health care professional regarding simultaneous \n\nadministration of Cyanokit with other medicines can be found at the end of this package leaflet (see \n\n'Handling instructions'). \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThis medicine is an emergency treatment. It can be administered during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you were pregnant or think you may have been pregnant during \n\ntreatment with Cyanokit. \n\nYour doctor will recommend you to stop breast-feeding after treatment with Cyanokit. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Cyanokit is used  \n\n \n\nYour doctor or health care professional will give you Cyanokit by infusion into a vein. You may need \n\none or two infusions. \n\n \n\nYou will have the first infusion of Cyanokit over 15 minutes. For adults, the initial dose is 5 g. For \n\nchildren, it is 70 mg/kg body weight, up to a maximum dose of 5 g. If you need a second infusion, you \n\nwill have it over 15 minutes to 2 hours. It depends on how serious the poisoning is. The maximum \n\ntotal recommended dose is 10 g for adults, and 140 mg/kg in children up to a maximum of 10 g. \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions for your doctor or other health care professional on how to prepare the Cyanokit \n\ninfusion and how to determine the dose can be found at the end of this package leaflet (see 'Handling \n\ninstructions'). \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \n\nfollowing side effects may be expected (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):  \n\n \n\nAllergy (hypersensitivity) \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you have the following symptoms during or after this treatment: \n\n swelling around the eyes, lips, tongue, throat or hands \n\n breathing difficulties, hoarseness, difficulty in speaking \n\n skin redness, nettle rash (urticaria) or itching. \n\nSuch side effects may be serious and need immediate attention. \n\n \n\nHeart and blood pressure problems \n\n \n\n symptoms such as headache or dizziness, as they may be due to a rise in blood pressure. This \n\nrise in blood pressure especially occurs at the end of having this treatment and usually settles \n\ndown within several hours \n\n irregular heart beat \n\n redness of the face (flush). \n\nA decrease in blood pressure and a faster heart beat have also been observed in patients who have \n\ncyanide poisoning. \n\n \n\nBreathing and chest problems \n\n \n\n fluid in the chest (pleural effusion) \n\n breathing difficulties \n\n a feeling of tightness in the throat  \n\n dry throat \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n chest pressure. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary problems \n\n \n\n kidney injuries such as acute kidney impairment and urine crystals.  \n\n red colouration of the urine. \n\nAll patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the first three days  \n\nfollowing administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after administration \n\nof Cyanokit. This red colouration has no other consequences on your body. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (digestive) problems \n\n \n\n discomfort in your stomach \n\n indigestion \n\n diarrhoea \n\n feeling sick (nausea) \n\n being sick (vomiting) \n\n difficulty in swallowing. \n\n \n\nEye problems \n\n \n\n swelling, irritation, redness. \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \n\n \n\n most patients will experience a reversible red colouration of the skin and membranes lining \n\nbody cavities (mucous membranes) that may last up to 15 days after administration of Cyanokit. \n\n blister-like lesions on the skin (pustular rashes). These may last for several weeks, and affect \n\nmainly the face and the neck. \n\n inflammation in the part of the body where the medicine was infused. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\n \n\n restlessness \n\n problems with memory \n\n dizziness \n\n headache \n\n swelling of ankles \n\n changes in the results of blood tests for certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) \n\n coloured plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or reduction in the levels of certain \n\nlaboratory parameters. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.

There is no widely \n\navailable, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. However, if a cyanide blood level \n\ndetermination is planned, it is recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of \n\ntreatment with Cyanokit. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history \n\nand/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If there is clinical suspicion of cyanide \n\npoisoning, it is strongly recommended that Cyanokit be administered without delay. \n\n \n\nPreparation of Cyanokit \n\n \n\nEach vial is to be reconstituted with 100 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. \n\nSodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or \n\nglucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  \n\n \n\nThe Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 30 seconds to mix the solution. It must not be \n\nshaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. \n\nBecause the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. \n\nThe intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter \n\nand is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.

What you need to know before Cyanokit is used \n\n3. How Cyanokit is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How Cyanokit is stored \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Cyanokit is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nCyanokit contains the active substance hydroxocobalamin. \n\nCyanokit is an antidote for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning in all age ranges.  \n\nCyanokit is to be administered together with appropriate decontamination and supportive measures. \n\n \n\nCyanide is a highly poisonous chemical. Cyanide poisoning may be caused by exposure to smoke \n\nfrom household and industrial fires, breathing or swallowing cyanide, or contact with cyanide on skin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before Cyanokit is used \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or other health care professional  \n\n if you are allergic to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12. They will have to take it into account \n\nbefore treating you with Cyanokit. \n\n that you have been treated with Cyanokit if you need to have the following: \n\n- any blood or urine tests. Cyanokit may modify the results of these tests. \n\n- burn assessement. Cyanokit may interfere with the assessment as it causes red coloration of \n\nthe skin. \n\n- haemodialysis. Cyanokit may lead to shut down of haemodialysis machines until it is \n\neliminated from the blood (at least 5.5 to 6.5 days). \n\n- monitoring of renal function: Cyanokit may lead to kidney failure and urine crystals. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Cyanokit \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or other health care professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take \n\nany other medicines. \n\n \n\nDetailed information for your doctor or other health care professional regarding simultaneous \n\nadministration of Cyanokit with other medicines can be found at the end of this package leaflet (see \n\n'Handling instructions'). \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThis medicine is an emergency treatment. It can be administered during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you were pregnant or think you may have been pregnant during \n\ntreatment with Cyanokit. \n\nYour doctor will recommend you to stop breast-feeding after treatment with Cyanokit. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Cyanokit is used  \n\n \n\nYour doctor or health care professional will give you Cyanokit by infusion into a vein. You may need \n\none or two infusions. \n\n \n\nYou will have the first infusion of Cyanokit over 15 minutes. For adults, the initial dose is 5 g. For \n\nchildren, it is 70 mg/kg body weight, up to a maximum dose of 5 g. If you need a second infusion, you \n\nwill have it over 15 minutes to 2 hours. It depends on how serious the poisoning is. The maximum \n\ntotal recommended dose is 10 g for adults, and 140 mg/kg in children up to a maximum of 10 g. \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions for your doctor or other health care professional on how to prepare the Cyanokit \n\ninfusion and how to determine the dose can be found at the end of this package leaflet (see 'Handling \n\ninstructions'). \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \n\nfollowing side effects may be expected (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):  \n\n \n\nAllergy (hypersensitivity) \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you have the following symptoms during or after this treatment: \n\n swelling around the eyes, lips, tongue, throat or hands \n\n breathing difficulties, hoarseness, difficulty in speaking \n\n skin redness, nettle rash (urticaria) or itching. \n\nSuch side effects may be serious and need immediate attention. \n\n \n\nHeart and blood pressure problems \n\n \n\n symptoms such as headache or dizziness, as they may be due to a rise in blood pressure. This \n\nrise in blood pressure especially occurs at the end of having this treatment and usually settles \n\ndown within several hours \n\n irregular heart beat \n\n redness of the face (flush). \n\nA decrease in blood pressure and a faster heart beat have also been observed in patients who have \n\ncyanide poisoning. \n\n \n\nBreathing and chest problems \n\n \n\n fluid in the chest (pleural effusion) \n\n breathing difficulties \n\n a feeling of tightness in the throat  \n\n dry throat \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n chest pressure. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary problems \n\n \n\n kidney injuries such as acute kidney impairment and urine crystals.  \n\n red colouration of the urine. \n\nAll patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the first three days  \n\nfollowing administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after administration \n\nof Cyanokit. This red colouration has no other consequences on your body. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (digestive) problems \n\n \n\n discomfort in your stomach \n\n indigestion \n\n diarrhoea \n\n feeling sick (nausea) \n\n being sick (vomiting) \n\n difficulty in swallowing. \n\n \n\nEye problems \n\n \n\n swelling, irritation, redness. \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \n\n \n\n most patients will experience a reversible red colouration of the skin and membranes lining \n\nbody cavities (mucous membranes) that may last up to 15 days after administration of Cyanokit. \n\n blister-like lesions on the skin (pustular rashes). These may last for several weeks, and affect \n\nmainly the face and the neck. \n\n inflammation in the part of the body where the medicine was infused. \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \n\n \n\n blister-like lesions on the skin (pustular rashes). These may last for several weeks, and affect \n\nmainly the face and the neck. \n\n inflammation in the part of the body where the medicine was infused. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\n \n\n restlessness \n\n problems with memory \n\n dizziness \n\n headache \n\n swelling of ankles \n\n changes in the results of blood tests for certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) \n\n coloured plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or reduction in the levels of certain \n\nlaboratory parameters. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \n\nof this medicine. \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n5. How Cyanokit is stored  \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial, the cardboard box and the \n\ncarton after EXP. \n\n \n\nDo not store above 25°C. \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of ambulatory use, Cyanokit may be exposed during short periods to the temperature \n\nvariations of \n\n usual transport (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5 to 40°C) \n\n transport in the desert (4 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5 to 60°C) and \n\n freezing/defrosting cycles (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from -20 to 40°C). \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted medicine, see 'Handling instructions' at the end of this \n\npackage leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

After \n\nreconstitution with 200 mL of diluent, each mL of the reconstituted solution contains 25 mg of \n\nhydroxocobalamin. \n\n The other ingredient is hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). \n\n \n\nWhat Cyanokit looks like and contents of the pack \n\n \n\nCyanokit powder for solution for infusion is a dark red crystalline powder supplied in a glass vial \n\nclosed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium cap with a plastic lid. \n\n \n\nEach pack contains one vial packed in one cardboard box, one sterile transfer device, one sterile \n\nintravenous infusion set and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. \n\n \n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n\n \n\nSERB S.A. \n\nAvenue Louise 480  \n\n1050 Brussels \n\nBelgium \n\n \n\nManufacturer \n\n \n\nMerck Santé s.a.s. / SEMOY \n\n2, rue du Pressoir Vert \n\n45400 Semoy \n\nFrance \n\n \n\nOr  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nSERB S.A. \n\nAvenue Louise 480  \n\n1050 Brussels \n\nBelgium \n\n \n\nOr  \n\n \n\nSERB \n\n40 avenue George V \n\n75008 Paris \n\nFrance \n\n \n\nThis leaflet was last revised in MM/YYYY. \n\n \n\nOther sources of information \n\n \n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n \n\nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: \n\n \n\nHandling instructions \n\n \n\nTreatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy \n\nof oxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. \n\nConsideration must be given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. \n\n \n\nCyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above \n\nmeasures. \n\n \n\nThe presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely \n\navailable, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. However, if a cyanide blood level \n\ndetermination is planned, it is recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of \n\ntreatment with Cyanokit. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history \n\nand/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If there is clinical suspicion of cyanide \n\npoisoning, it is strongly recommended that Cyanokit be administered without delay. \n\n \n\nPreparation of Cyanokit \n\n \n\nThe vial is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. \n\nSodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or \n\nglucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  \n\n \n\nThe Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 1 minute to mix the solution. It must not be \n\nshaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. \n\nBecause the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. \n\nThe intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter \n\nand is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nInitial dose \n\nAdults: The initial dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (200 mL, complete volume of reconstituted solution). \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the initial dose of Cyanokit is \n\n70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nin kg \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n60 \n\nInitial dose  \n\nin g \n\nin mL \n\n \n\n0.35 \n\n14 \n\n \n\n0.70 \n\n28 \n\n \n\n1.40 \n\n56 \n\n \n\n2.10 \n\n84 \n\n \n\n2.80 \n\n112 \n\n \n\n3.50 \n\n140 \n\n \n\n4.20 \n\n168 \n\n \n\nSubsequent dose \n\nDepending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response, a second dose may be \n\nadministered  \n\n \n\nAdults: The subsequent dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (200 mL, complete volume of reconstituted solution). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the subsequent dose of Cyanokit \n\nis 70 mg/kg body weight not exceeding 5 g. \n\n \n\nMaximum dose \n\n \n\nAdults: The maximum total recommended dose is 10 g. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the maximum total recommended \n\ndose is 140 mg/kg not exceeding 10 g. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in these patients. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInitial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. \n\n \n\nThe rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely \n\nunstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. \n\n \n\nSimultaneous administration of Cyanokit and other products \n\n \n\nCyanokit must not be mixed with diluents other than sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or Lactated Ringer solution or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection. \n\n \n\nAs physical and chemical incompatibilities were observed with a number of selected medicinal \n\nproducts that are frequently used in resuscitation efforts, these and other medicinal products must not \n\nbe administered simultaneously in the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. \n\n \n\nIf blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) and \n\nhydroxocobalamin are administered simultaneously, use of separate intravenous lines (preferably on \n\ncontralateral extremities) is recommended. \n\n \n\nCombination with another cyanide antidote: Chemical incompatibility was observed with sodium \n\nthiosulfate and sodium nitrite.
