This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLartruvo 10 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 10 mg of olaratumab. \n \nEach 19 mL vial contains 190 mg of olaratumab. \nEach 50 mL vial contains 500 mg of olaratumab. \n \nOlaratumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in murine (NS0) cells by recombinant \nDNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach 19mL vial contains approximately 22 mg (1 mmol) sodium. \nEach 50 mL vial contains approximately 57 mg (2.5 mmol) sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nThe concentrate is clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow solution without visible \nparticles.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLartruvo is indicated in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with \nadvanced soft tissue sarcoma who are not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy \nand who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nOlaratumab therapy must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology. Patients \nshould be monitored during the infusion for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) \nin a setting with available resuscitation equipment (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of olaratumab is 15 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 \nand 8 of each 3 week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lartruvo is administered \nin combination with doxorubicin for up to 8 cycles of treatment, followed by Lartruvo monotherapy in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\npatients whose disease has not progressed. Doxorubicin is given on day 1 of each cycle following the \nLartruvo infusion. \n \nPremedication \nPremedication with an H1 antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine) and dexamethasone (or equivalent \nmedicinal products) should be given, intravenously, 30–60 minutes prior to the olaratumab doses on \ndays 1 and 8 of cycle 1 in all patients. For subsequent cycles, premedication with an H1 antagonist \n(e.g., diphenhydramine) should be given intravenously 30–60 minutes prior to each dose of \nolaratumab.  \n \nFor patients who experience Grade 1 or 2 IRR, the infusion should be interrupted and paracetamol, \nH1 antagonist and dexamethasone (or equivalent medicinal products) administered as needed. For all \nsubsequent infusions, premedication with the following (or equivalent medicinal products) \ndiphenhydramine hydrochloride (intravenously), paracetamol, and dexamethasone, should be given.  \n \nIn the event that intravenous administration of an H1 antagonist is not possible, equivalent alternative \npremedication should be given (e.g. oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride at least 90 minutes prior to \nthe infusion).   \n  \nPosology adjustments for olaratumab \nFor dose adjustment recommendations related to doxorubicin, refer to the current doxorubicin \nprescribing information.  \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) \nRecommendations for the management of olaratumab IRRs are provided in table 1. \n \n\nTable 1 – Management recommendations for infusion-related reactions (IRRs) \n \n\nToxicity \ngradea \n\nManagement recommendations \n(any occurrence) \n\nGrade 1-2 • Stop the infusion \n• Paracetamol, H1 antagonist and dexamethasone should be \n\nadministered as needed (see premedication section)  \n• Once the reaction has resolved, resume infusion at a 50 % \n\ndecreased infusion rate.b \n• Monitor patient for worsening of condition. \n• For subsequent infusions, please see premedication section. \n\nGrade 3-4 • Immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with \nolaratumab (see section 4.4). \n\na Grade per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI \nCTCAE), Version 4.03 \nb Once the infusion rate has been reduced for a Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reaction, it is \nrecommended that the lower infusion rate be utilized for all subsequent infusions. The infusion \nduration should not exceed 2 hours. \n\n \nOther non-haematology toxicities \nFor serious Grade ≥ 3 non-haematologic toxicity deemed related to olaratumab, the dose of olaratumab \nshould be withheld until toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to pretreatment baseline. For subsequent \ninfusions, the dose should be reduced to 12 mg/kg for serious Grade 3 toxicities and to 10 mg/kg for \nGrade 4 toxicities. If a Grade 3 toxicity recurs despite the dose reduction, the dose should be reduced \nfurther to 10 mg/kg. In case of recurrence of a Grade 4 toxicity, treatment with olaratumab should be \npermanently discontinued. \n \nNeutropenia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf neutropenic fever/infection or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 1 week occurs, administration \nof olaratumab should be temporarily discontinued until the absolute neutrophil count is 1,000 / µL or \nhigher and then the dose of olaratumab should be resumed at the reduced dose of 12 mg/kg. If \nneutropenic fever/infection or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 1 week recurs despite dose \nreduction, the dose should be reduced further to 10 mg/kg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (> 65 years) \nData on very elderly patients (> 75 years) are very limited (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \nNo dose reductions other than those recommended for the general patient population are necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nThere have been no formal studies with olaratumab in patients with renal impairment. PopPK data \nsuggest that no dose adjustments are required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nThere are no data regarding olaratumab administration in patients with severe renal impairment \n(calculated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere have been no formal studies with olaratumab in patients with hepatic impairment. PopPK data \nsuggest that no dose adjustments are required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are very \nlimited data regarding olaratumab administration in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. There \nare no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n  \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of olaratumab in children aged 0 to 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nAfter dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, olaratumab is administered \nas an intravenous infusion over approximately 60 minutes. In order to accommodate larger infusion \nvolumes that may be needed for patients requiring higher doses, the duration of infusion should be \nincreased such that the maximum infusion rate of 25 mg/minute is not exceeded.  \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs), including anaphylactic reactions, were reported in clinical trials with \nolaratumab. The majority of these reactions occurred during or following the first olaratumab infusion. \nSymptoms of IRRs included flushing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills, and in some \ncases manifested as severe hypotension, anaphylactic shock, or fatal cardiac arrest. Severe IRRs such \nas anaphylactic reactions can occur despite the use of premedication. Patients should be monitored \nduring the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs in a setting with available resuscitation \nequipment. For management and dose adjustments in patients who experience Grade 1 or 2 IRR \nduring the infusion, see section 4.2. In patients who have experienced a previous Grade 1 or 2 IRR, \npremedication with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (intravenously), paracetamol, and dexamethasone \nis recommended. Olaratumab should be immediately and permanently discontinued in patients who \nexperience Grade 3 or 4 IRR (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  \n  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nNeutropenia \nPatients receiving olaratumab and doxorubicin are at risk of neutropenia (see section 4.8). Neutrophil \ncount should be checked prior to Olaratumab dosing on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. Neutrophil \ncount should be monitored during the treatment with olaratumab and doxorubicin and supportive care \nshould be administered such as antibiotics or G-CSF as per local guidelines. For dosage adjustments \nrelated to neutropenia, refer to section 4.2.  \n \nHaemorrhagic events \nPatients receiving olaratumab and doxorubicin are at risk of haemorrhagic events (see section 4.8). \nPlatelet counts should be checked prior to olaratumab dosing on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. \nCoagulation parameters should be monitored in patients with conditions predisposing to bleeding, \nsuch as anticoagulant use. In a study of olaratumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin, there \nwas one case of fatal intracranial haemorrhage in a patient who had experienced a fall while on \ntreatment. \n \nAnthracycline pre-treated patients \nThe risk of cardiac toxicity rises with increasing cumulative doses of anthracyclines, including \ndoxorubicin. There are no data for the combination of olaratumab and doxorubicin in anthracycline \npre-treated patients, including pre-treatment with doxorubicin (see section 4.1). \n \nSodium restricted diet \nThis medicinal product contains 22 mg sodium per each 19 mL vial and 57 mg sodium per each \n50 mL vial. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nCardiac toxicity \nDoxorubicin can cause cardiotoxicity. The risk of toxicity rises with increasing cumulative doses and \nis higher in individuals with a history of cardiomyopathy, mediastinal irradiation or pre-existing \ncardiac disease. To minimise doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity, the use of appropriate cardio-\nprotective measures (LVEF measurement, such as ECHO or MUGA scan, ECG monitoring, and/or \nuse of cardioprotective agents) should be considered and planned in all patients before the start and \nthroughout the treatment.  \n \nPlease refer to doxorubicin SmPC for recommendation on cardiac monitoring. \n \nIn the phase 2 trial, patients in both treatment groups that received 5 or more cycles of doxorubicin \nreceived dexrazoxane prior to each dose of doxorubicin from cycle 5 onwards to minimize the risk of \ndoxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n  \nHepatic impairment \nAs doxorubicin is rapidly metabolised and predominantly eliminated by the biliary system, the toxicity \nof doxorubicin is enhanced in patients with hepatic impairment. Refer to doxorubicin SmPC for \nappropriate monitoring of hepatic function and doxorubicin dose adjustments in patients with impaired \nliver function. \n  \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOlaratumab is a human monoclonal antibody. In a dedicated DDI study, no pharmacokinetic \ninteractions were observed in patients between olaratumab and doxorubicin. \n \nNo other formal DDI studies with olaratumab and medicinal products commonly used in cancer \npatients, including those with STS (e.g. antiemetics, analgesics, anti-diarrheal drugs, oral \ncontraceptives, etc.), have been performed.  \n \nAs monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug \nmetabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nproducts is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab. Conversely, olaratumab is not \nanticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products. \n \nAdministration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by \nchemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin may result in serious or fatal infections. Vaccination \nwith a live vaccine should be avoided in patients receiving olaratumab in combination with \ndoxorubicin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on olaratumab \nand should be informed of the potential hazard to the pregnancy and foetus. Women of childbearing \npotential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months \nfollowing the last dose of olaratumab.  \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of olaratumab in pregnant women. Reproductive \nand development toxicity study conducted with an anti-murine PDGFRα antibody in mice showed \nfoetal malformations and skeletal alterations (see section 5.3).  \nBased on its mechanism of action (see section 5.1), olaratumab has the potential to cause foetal harm. \nOlaratumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n  \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether olaratumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is excreted in human milk, \ntherefore breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with olaratumab and for at least \n3 months following the last dose. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of olaratumab on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOlaratumab may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Severe IRRs, \nalso including a fatal case (see section 4.4) were reported in 3.1 % of patients and mainly presented \nwith shortness of breath, loss of consciousness and hypotension. All severe IRRs occurred during or \nimmediately after the first administration of olaratumab. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the phase 2 trial, the incidence of neutropenia was 59.4 % (all Grades) and 54.7 % (Grade 3) in the \nolaratumab plus doxorubicin arm and 38.5 % (all Grades) and 33.8 % (Grade 3) in the doxorubicin \nalone arm. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 12.5 % in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm and \n13.8 % in the doxorubicin alone arm. For dose adjustments, refer to section 4.2 \n \nMusculoskeletal pain \nIn the phase 2 trial the incidence of Musculoskeletal pain was 64.1 % (all Grades)  and 7.8 % \n(Grade 3) in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm and 24.6 % (all Grades) and 1.5 % (Grade 3) in the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\ndoxorubicin alone arm. In the majority of patients the pain was related to the patients’ underlying \ncancer or metastases or pre-existing or concomitant conditions. The majority of these events occurred \nin the first 4 cycles. The pain can last from few days to up to 200 days. In some patients there was a \nrecurrence of pain .The pain did not worsen with time or during recurrence. \n \nCardiac toxicity \nNo clinically meaningful difference in doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity was observed between the \ntwo treatment arms of the study. The rate of cardiac arrhythmias was similar in both arms (15.6 % in \nthe Investigational Arm and 15.4 % in the Control Arm). The rate of treatment-emergent cardiac \ndysfunction was comparable between the two treatment arms (7.8 % in the Investigational Arm and \n6.2 % in the Control Arm).  \n \nHaemorrhagic events \nIn the phase 2 trial, the frequency of haemorrhagic events considered related to any study drug was \n3.1 % in either treatment arm. All of these events were Grade 1/2 and were confounded by multiple \nfactors. Three Grade ≥3 events, including one fatal, have been reported across the clinical \ndevelopment programme of olaratumab (see section 4.4). \n \nToxicity in the elderly \nThere was a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 adverse reactions, adverse reactions leading to \ndiscontinuation and a higher rate of haematological toxicity in the elderly population compared to the \noverall study population (see section 4.2). The rates of discontinuation were comparable between \ntreatment arms across all age groups. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with Lartruvo overdose in human clinical trials. Lartruvo has been \nadministered in a Phase 1 study up to 20 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle without reaching a \nmaximum tolerated dose. In case of overdose, use supportive therapy. There is no known antidote to \nLartruvo overdose.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC27 \n \nMechanism of action \nOlaratumab is an antagonist of platelet derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), expressed on \ntumour and stromal cells. Olaratumab is a targeted, recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G \nsubclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that specifically binds PDGFR-α, blocking PDGF AA, -BB, \nand -CC binding and receptor activation. As a result, in vitro olaratumab inhibits PDGFR-α pathway \nsignalling in tumour and stromal cells. In addition, in vivo olaratumab has been shown to disrupt the \nPDGFR-α pathway in tumour cells and inhibit tumour growth.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nOverall, a low incidence of both treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies \nwere detected in clinical trial samples.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of olaratumab was assessed in a Phase 1b/2, multi-centre study in \nanthracycline naïve patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced soft tissue \nsarcoma not amenable to receive surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent. Patients with \ngastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) or Kaposi sarcoma were not enrolled. The Phase 2 portion of \nthe study was a randomised, open label study of olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin \nalone. A total of 133 patients were randomised, of whom 129 received at least one dose of study \ntreatment (64 in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm and 65 in the doxorubicin arm). Patients were \nrequired to have histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced soft tissue sarcoma and ECOG \nperformance status of 0-2. Randomisation was stratified by PDGFR-α expression (positive versus \nnegative), number of previous lines of treatment (0 versus 1 or more lines), histological tumour type \n(leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and others) and ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2). \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) on Day 1 and Day 8 plus \ndoxorubicin (75 mg/m²) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles or doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) \nalone on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, also for up to 8 cycles. Olaratumab and doxorubicin were \nadministered by intravenous infusion. During Cycles 5 to 8 on both arms, dexrazoxane (dosed at a \nratio of 10:1 to the administered dose of doxorubicin) could be administered on Day 1 of each cycle at \nthe investigator’s discretion to reduce potential doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity. All patients \nreceiving more than 4 cycles of doxorubicin received dexrazoxane. Patients in the olaratumab plus \ndoxorubicin arm could continue on olaratumab monotherapy until disease progression, unacceptable \ntoxicity or any other reason for treatment discontinuation occurred.   \n \nDemographics and baseline characteristics were quite similar between treatment arms in the phase 2 \nportion of the clinical trial. The median age was 58 years with 42 patients ≥ 65 years of age. 86.4 % of \nthe patients were Caucasian. More than 25 different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes were represented in \nthis trial, the most frequent being leiomyosarcoma (38.4 %), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma \n(18.1 %) and liposarcoma (17.3 %). Other subtypes were infrequently represented. Patients had \nreceived 0-4 previous lines of therapy for treatment of advanced disease but had not previously \nreceived treatment with anthracyclines. The number of patients receiving post-study systemic therapy \nwas similar between arms. Ten patients in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm and 5 patients in the \ndoxorubicin arm received post-study radiotherapy only. 3 patients in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin \narm and 1 patient in the doxorubicin arm had post-study surgery only. 2 patients in the olaratumab \nplus doxorubicin arm and none in the doxorubicin arm received both post-study radiotherapy and \nsurgery.  \n   \nThe median cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 487.6 mg/m2 in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm \nand 299.6 mg/m2 in the doxorubicin alone arm. The primary efficacy outcome measure was \nprogression free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment. Key secondary efficacy outcome measures \nwere overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) (see Table 3). The study met its primary \nendpoint (PFS). PFS according to a post-hoc, blinded, independent assessment was 8.2 months vs \n4.4 months; HR = 0.670; p = 0.1208. A statistically significant improvement in OS was seen in the \nolaratumab plus doxorubicin arm in comparison to treatment with doxorubicin alone in the overall \npopulation. The main analysis was performed in the following two subgroups: Leiomyosarcoma \n(LMS) and non-LMS (other). Subgroups analysis of OS is shown in figure 2. Difference in objective \nresponse rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] according to investigator assessment \nwas not statistically significant (18.2 % vs 11.9 % in patients randomised to olaratumab plus \ndoxorubicin compared to patients randomized to doxorubicin respectively). \n \nEfficacy results are shown in Table 3 and Figures 1 and 2.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3.

This \ncorresponds to a mean terminal half-life of approximately 11 days. \n \nSpecial populations \nAge, sex, and race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of olaratumab based on a PopPK \nanalysis. Clearance and volume of distribution had a positive correlation with body weight. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of \nolaratumab. Based on a PopPK analysis, no clinically meaningful differences in the clearance of \nolaratumab were observed in patients with mild (calculated creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60-89 mL/min, \nn = 43), or moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min, n = 15) renal impairment compared to patients with normal \nrenal function (CLcr ≥90 mL/min, n = 85). No data were available from patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of \nolaratumab. Based on a PopPK analysis, no clinically meaningful differences in the clearance of \nolaratumab were observed in patients with mild (total bilirubin within upper limit of normal [ULN] \nand AST>ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0-1.5 times ULN and any AST level, n = 16), or moderate (total \nbilirubin > 1.5-3.0 times ULN, n = 1) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic \nfunction (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n = 126). No data were available from patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3.0 times ULN and any AST level). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeat dose toxicity studies in \nmonkeys. \n \nNo animal studies have been performed to test olaratumab for potential of carcinogenicity, \ngenotoxicity, or fertility impairment. Administration of an anti-murine PDGFR- α surrogate antibody \nto pregnant mice during organogenesis at 50 and 150 mg/kg resulted in increased malformations \n(abnormal eyelid development) and skeletal alterations (frontal/parietal additional ossification site). \nThe foetal effects in mice administered the surrogate antibody occurred at exposures less than the \nAUC exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 15 mg/kg olaratumab. \n \n \n6.

Do not shake the vial. The content of the vials should be \ninspected for particulate matter and discolouration (the concentrate for solution for infusion should be \nclear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow without visible particles) prior to \nadministration. If particulate matter or discolouration is identified, the vial must be discarded. The \ndose and volume of olaratumab needed should be calculated to prepare the infusion solution. Vials \ncontain 190 mg or 500 mg as a 10 mg/mL solution of olaratumab. Only use sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection as a diluent.  \n \nIn case of prefilled intravenous infusion container usage  \nBased on the calculated volume of olaratumab, the corresponding volume of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection should be removed from the prefilled 250 mL intravenous \ncontainer. The calculated volume of olaratumab should be aseptically transferred to the intravenous \ncontainer. The final total volume in the container should be 250 mL. The container should be gently \ninverted to ensure adequate mixing. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution.   \n \nIn case of empty intravenous infusion container usage \nThe calculated volume of olaratumab should be aseptically transferred into an empty intravenous \ninfusion container. A sufficient quantity of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection \nshould be added to the container to make the total volume 250 mL. The container should be gently \ninverted to ensure adequate mixing. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution.  \n \nAdminister via an infusion pump. A separate infusion line must be used and the line must be flushed \nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection at the end of the infusion. \n  \nAny unused portion of olaratumab left in a vial should be discarded, as the product contains no \nantimicrobial preservatives.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Lartruvo is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Lartruvo \n3. How you are given Lartruvo \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Lartruvo  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lartruvo is and what it is used for \n \nLartruvo contains the active substance olaratumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nmonoclonal antibodies. \n \nOlaratumab recognises and attaches specifically to a protein known as platelet-derived growth factor \nreceptor-α (PDGFR-α). PDGFR-α is found in large amounts on some cancer cells where it stimulates \nthe cells to grow and divide. When olaratumab attaches to PDGFR-α it may prevent cancer cell growth \nand survival. \n \nLartruvo is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine called doxorubicin for the \ntreatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have not been previously treated with \ndoxorubicin. Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer that starts in the soft tissues, such as the muscles, fat, \ncartilage and blood vessels. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Lartruvo \n \nYou must not be given Lartruvo \n- if you are allergic to olaratumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nYou should tell your doctor about any of the following:  \n-  if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse immediately if the following applies to you (or you are not sure): \n \n\n– Infusion-related reaction \nInfusion-related reactions may occur during treatment with Lartruvo. Such reactions may be allergic. \nSymptoms may include back pain, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, fever, flushing, difficulty in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32 \n\nbreathing and wheezing. In severe cases, you may experience very low blood pressure, feel faint, and \nexperience breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways, which could be life-threatening. \nYour doctor will give you other medicines before you receive Lartruvo to reduce the risk of infusion-\nrelated reactions. Your doctor or nurse will check for side effects during and after your infusion. If you \nhave a severe infusion-related reaction, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose of Lartruvo or \nstop your treatment with Lartruvo. See section 4 for more details about infusion-related reactions \nwhich may occur during or after the infusion.  \n  \n\n– Bleeding \nLartruvo and doxorubicin may decrease your platelet count. Platelets help your blood to clot and a low \nplatelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. If you experience significant bleeding, symptoms may \ninclude extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness or changes in the colour of your stools. Your doctor \nwill check your platelet count prior to treatment with Lartruvo. \n \n\n– Reduction in the number of white blood cells \nLartruvo and doxorubicin may decrease the number of white blood cells (including neutrophils). \nWhite blood cells are important for fighting infection. A low white blood cell count may increase your \nrisk for infection. Your doctor will check your white blood cell counts prior to treatment with \nLartruvo. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLartruvo should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is no information \nabout how it works in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Lartruvo \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nBefore starting treatment you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you \nmay be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. \n \nAvoid getting pregnant while receiving this medicine and for at least 3 months after the last dose of \nLartruvo as this medicine may harm your unborn child. Talk to your doctor about the best \ncontraception for you. \n \nIt is not known whether olaratumab gets into breast milk and if the breast-fed infant is at risk of harm. \nAsk your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with Lartruvo.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known if Lartruvo will affect your ability to drive. If you get any symptoms that affect your \nability to concentrate and react, such as tiredness, do not drive or use machines until the effect goes \naway. \n \nLartruvo contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 22 mg sodium in each 19 mL vial and 57 mg sodium in each 50 mL vial. This \nshould be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n  \n \n3. How you are given Lartruvo \n \nA doctor experienced in the use of anti-cancer medicines will supervise your Lartruvo therapy. \n \nPremedication \nYou will be given medicines to reduce the risk of an infusion-related reaction before you receive \nLartruvo. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\nDose and administration \nThe recommended dose of Lartruvo is 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight on days 1 and 8 of \neach 3-week cycle. Lartruvo is given in combination with the medicine doxorubicin for up to 8 cycles \nand then it is given on its own. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how well and \nfor how long treatment with Lartruvo works and how well you feel. Your doctor will discuss this with \nyou. \n \nThis medicine is given as an infusion into a vein via a drip. The drip lasts about 60 minutes. \n \nDetailed instructions for your doctor or your nurse on how to prepare Lartruvo infusion are included at \nthe end of this package leaflet (see ‘Handling instructions’). \n \nDose adjustments \nDuring each infusion, your doctor or nurse will check for side effects. Your doctor may also give you \na smaller dose or delay your dose of Lartruvo if you get serious side effects including a lowering of \nyour white blood cell counts. If you have an infusion-related reaction during treatment, your doctor or \nnurse may slow down or stop your Lartruvo infusion. \n  \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Your \ndoctor will discuss these with you and will explain the risks and benefits of your treatment. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported: \n \nInfusion reactions \nLartruvo has been associated with infusion reactions (see section 2 “Warnings and precautions”). Tell \nyour doctor or nurse immediately if you feel unwell during infusion. Below is a list of some typical \nsymptoms associated with infusion reactions: \n\n• Feeling faint \n• Fever \n• Chills \n• Flushing \n• Shortness of breath \n\n \nOther symptoms may occur as well (see section 2 “Warnings and precautions”). Your doctor may \nconsider slowing the Lartruvo infusion or interrupting it to manage these symptoms. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n– nausea \n– pain in your muscles, joints or bones (musculoskeletal pain) \n– low white blood cell counts (including neutrophils and lymphocytes which may increase the \n\nrisk of infection) \n– pain or sores in your mouth or throat (mucositis) \n– vomiting  \n– diarrhoea \n– headache \n– infusion-related reactions \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

Inspect the contents of the vials for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration. The concentrate for solution for infusion must be clear to slightly opalescent and \ncolourless to slightly yellow prior to dilution. If particulate matter or discolouration is identified, the \nvial must be discarded.  \n \nVials contain 190 mg or 500 mg as a 10 mg/mL solution of olaratumab; calculate the dose and volume \nof olaratumab needed to prepare the infusion solution. Only use sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) \nsolution for injection as a diluent. \n \nTo administer using pre-filled intravenous infusion containers   \nBased on the calculated volume of olaratumab, aseptically remove the corresponding volume of \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection from the prefilled 250 mL intravenous \ncontainer and transfer the olaratumab medicine into the container to bring the final volume in the \ncontainer back to 250 mL. Gently invert the container to mix. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the \ninfusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other solutions or co-infuse with other electrolytes or \nmedicines. \n \nTo administer using empty intravenous infusion containers \nAseptically transfer the calculated volume of olaratumab into an empty intravenous infusion container. \nAdd a sufficient quantity of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection to the container to \nmake the total volume 250 mL. Gently invert the container to mix. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE \nthe infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other solutions or co-infuse with other electrolytes or \nmedicines. \n \nAdminister via an infusion pump. A separate infusion line must be used and the line must be flushed \nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection at the end of the infusion. \n \nParenteral medicines should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. If \nparticulate matter is identified, discard the infusion solution. \n \nDiscard any unused portion of olaratumab left in a vial, as the product contains no antimicrobial \npreservatives. \n \nAny unused medicines or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n  Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnnex IV \n \n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \nauthorisation(s) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for olaratumab, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n \nBased on cases of anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock reported in the post-marketing setting, \nthese adverse drug reactions should be specifically be mentioned under the category of \ninfusion-related reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The frequency of anaphylactic \nreactions/anaphylactic shock is already calculated as part of grade 3-4 infusion-related reactions in the \ntable of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in the same section of the SmPC. The current wording of the \nPackage leaflet is considered sufficient to communicate this risk. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for olaratumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing olaratumab is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
