PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n \n\nClear colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nLantus contains insulin glargine, an insulin analogue, and has a prolonged duration of action. \n\nLantus should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day.  \n\n \n\nThe dose regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. In patients with type 2 diabetes \n\nmellitus, Lantus can also be given together with orally active antidiabetic medicinal products. \n\nThe potency of this medicinal product is stated in units. These units are exclusive to Lantus and are \n\nnot the same as IU or the units used to express the potency of other insulin analogues (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nSpecial population \n\nElderly population (\u226565 years old) \n\nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity \n\nfor gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n\uf0b7 Adolescents and children aged 2 years and older patients \nSafety and efficacy of Lantus have been established in adolescents and children aged 2 years and older \n\n(see section 5.1). The dose regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. \n\n\uf0b7 Children below 2 years of age  \nThe safety and efficacy of Lantus have not been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nSwitch from other insulins to Lantus \n\nWhen switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen \n\nwith Lantus, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant \n\nantidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or \n\nfast-acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic medicinal products). \n\n \n\nSwitch from twice daily NPH insulin to Lantus \n\nTo reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their \n\nbasal insulin regimen from a twice daily NPH insulin to a once daily regimen with Lantus should \n\nreduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20-30% during the first weeks of treatment.  \n\n \nSwitch from insulin glargine 300 units/ml to Lantus \nLantus and Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) are not bioequivalent and are not directly \n\ninterchangeable. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin \n\nregimen from an insulin regimen with once daily insulin glargine 300 units/ml to a once daily regimen \n\nwith Lantus should reduce their dose by approximately 20%. \n\n \n\nDuring the first weeks the reduction should, at least partially, be compensated by an increase in \n\nmealtime insulin, after this period the regimen should be adjusted individually. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the switch and in the initial weeks thereafter. \n\n \n\nWith improved metabolic control and resulting increase in insulin sensitivity a further adjustment in \n\ndose regimen may become necessary. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if the \n\npatient's weight or life-style changes, change of timing of insulin dose or other circumstances arise that \n\nincrease susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with high insulin doses because of antibodies to human insulin may experience an improved \n\ninsulin response with Lantus. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nLantus is administered subcutaneously. \n\n \n\nLantus should not be administered intravenously. The prolonged duration of action of Lantus is \n\ndependent on its injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous administration of the usual \n\nsubcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences in serum insulin or glucose levels after abdominal, deltoid \n\nor thigh administration of Lantus. Injection sites must be rotated within a given injection area from one \n\ninjection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see \n\nsection 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nLantus must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted. Mixing or diluting can change its \n\ntime/action profile and mixing can cause precipitation. \n\n \n\nLantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nLantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nLantus 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nLantus SoloStar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nLantus SoloStar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully \n\n(see section 6.6). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nLantus is not the insulin of choice for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Instead, regular insulin \n\nadministered intravenously is recommended in such cases. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin \n\nabsorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A \n\nsudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. \n\nBlood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment \n\nof antidiabetic medications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nThe time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, \n\ntherefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. Due to more sustained basal insulin supply \n\nwith Lantus, less nocturnal but more early morning hypoglycaemia can be expected. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \n\ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \n\nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n\n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n\n- who are elderly, \n\n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n\n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n\n- with a long history of diabetes, \n\n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n\n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nThe prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness \n\nof hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the \n\nsusceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose \n\nadjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n\n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g., by removal of stress factors), \n\n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n\n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n\n- inadequate food intake, \n\n- missed meals, \n\n- alcohol consumption, \n\n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders, (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \n\nInsulin antibodies \n\nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \n\nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \n\nhypoglycaemia (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPens to be used with Lantus 100 units/ml in cartridges \n\nLantus 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Lantus cartridges should only be \n\nused with the following pens:  \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Lantus in 0.5 unit dose increments  \n\n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Lantus in 1 unit \n\ndose increments. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens.  \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6) \n\n \n\nHandling of the SoloStar pre-filled pen \n\nLantus SoloStar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). Before using SoloStar, \n\nthe instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully. SoloStar has to be used \n\nas recommended in these instructions for use (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have \n\nbeen accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine. Insulin label must always be checked \n\nbefore each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin glargine and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Lantus with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Lantus is considered. If the combination is \n\nused, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.  \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin \n\nglargine. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, \n\nsomatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, \n\nterbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. clozapine and \n\nolanzapine) and protease inhibitors. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin glargine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \n\navailable. A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate \n\nno specific adverse effects of insulin glargine on pregnancy and no specific malformative nor \n\nfeto/neonatal toxicity of insulin glargine. Animal data do not indicate reproductive toxicity.  \n\nThe use of Lantus may be considered during pregnancy, if clinically needed. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy to prevent adverse outcomes associated with hyperglycemia. Insulin \n\nrequirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and \n\nthird trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of \n\nhypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects of ingested \n\ninsulin glargine on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since insulin glargine as a peptide is \n\ndigested into aminoacids in the human gastrointestinal tract. Breast-feeding women may require \n\nadjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia (very common), in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may \n\noccur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: \u22651/10; common: \u22651/100 to <1/10; \n\nuncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000; not known: cannot \n\nbe estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nsystem organ \n\nclasses \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n   Allergic \n\nreactions \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nHypoglycaemia      \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\n    Dysgeusia  \n\nEyes disorders    Visual \n\nimpairment \n\n \n\nRetinopathy \n\n  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n Lipohypertro-\n\nphy \n\nLipoatrophy   Cutaneous \n\namyloidosis \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\n    Myalgia  \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\n Injection site \n\nreactions \n\n Oedema   \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or \n\nsevere hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate-type allergic reactions to insulin are rare. Such reactions to insulin (including insulin \n\nglargine) or the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, \n\nangio-oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock, and may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. In patients with proliferative retinopathy, \n\nparticularly if not treated with photocoagulation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes may result in \n\ntransient amaurosis. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce \n\nor prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nInjection site reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation. Most minor \n\nreactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nRarely, insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema particularly if previously poor metabolic \n\ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn general, the safety profile for children and adolescents (\u226418 years of age) is similar to the safety \n\nprofile for adults.  \n\nThe adverse reaction reports received from post marketing surveillance included relatively more \n\nfrequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, \n\nurticaria) in children and adolescents (\u226418 years of age) than in adults. \n\nClinical study safety data are not available for children under 2 years. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nof the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. \n\nATC Code: A10AE04. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH. It is \n\ncompletely soluble at the acidic pH of the Lantus injection solution (pH 4). After injection into the \n\nsubcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from \n\nwhich small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, \n\npredictable concentration/time profile with a prolonged duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsulin glargine is metabolised into 2 active metabolites M1 and M2 (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nInsulin receptor binding: In vitro studies indicate that the affinity of insulin glargine and its \n\nmetabolites M1 and M2 for the human insulin receptor is similar to the one of human insulin.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nIGF-1 receptor binding: The affinity of insulin glargine for the human IGF-1 receptor is approximately \n\n5 to 8-fold greater than that of human insulin (but approximately 70 to 80-fold lower than the one of \n\nIGF-1), whereas M1 and M2 bind the IGF-1 receptor with slightly lower affinity compared to human \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nThe total therapeutic insulin concentration (insulin glargine and its metabolites) found in type 1 \n\ndiabetic patients was markedly lower than what would be required for a halfmaximal occupation of the \n\nIGF-1 receptor and the subsequent activation of the mitogenic-proliferative pathway initiated by the \n\nIGF-1 receptor. Physiological concentrations of endogenous IGF-1 may activate the \n\nmitogenic-proliferative pathway; however, the therapeutic concentrations found in insulin therapy, \n\nincluding in Lantus therapy, are considerably lower than the pharmacological concentrations required \n\nto activate the IGF-1 pathway. \n\n \n\nThe primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin \n\nand its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by \n\nskeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the \n\nadipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. \n\n \n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies, intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin have been shown to \n\nbe equipotent when given at the same doses. As with all insulins, the time course of action of insulin \n\nglargine may be affected by physical activity and other variables. \n\n \n\nIn euglycaemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, the onset of action \n\nof subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than with human NPH insulin, its effect profile was \n\nsmooth and peakless, and the duration of its effect was prolonged. \n\n \n\nThe following graph shows the results from a study in patients: \n\n \n\nActivity profile in patients with type 1 diabetes \n\n \n*determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels (hourly mean \n\nvalues) \n\n \n\nThe longer duration of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is directly related to its slower rate of \n\nabsorption and supports once daily administration. The time course of action of insulin and insulin \n\nanalogues such as insulin glargine may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same \n\nindividual. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nIn a clinical study, symptoms of hypoglycaemia or counter-regulatory hormone responses were similar \n\nafter intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin both in healthy volunteers and patients with \n\ntype 1 diabetes. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, antibodies that cross-react with human insulin and insulin glargine were observed \n\nwith the same frequency in both NPH-insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups. \n\n \n\nEffects of insulin glargine (once daily) on diabetic retinopathy were evaluated in an open-label 5 year \n\nNPH-controlled study (NPH given bid) in 1024 type 2 diabetic patients in which progression of \n\nretinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale was \n\ninvestigated by fundus photography. No significant difference was seen in the progression of diabetic \n\nretinopathy when insulin glargine was compared to NPH insulin. \n\n \n\nThe ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention) study was a multicenter, \n\nrandomised, 2x2 factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular (CV) \n\nrisk with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12% of participants) or \n\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus treated with \u22641 antidiabetic oral agent (88% of participants). Participants were \n\nrandomised (1:1) to receive insulin glargine (n=6264), titrated to reach FPG \u226495 mg/dl (5.3 mM), or \n\nstandard care (n=6273).  \n\nThe first co-primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal \n\nmyocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co-primary efficacy outcome was the \n\ntime to the first occurrence of any of the first co-primary events, or revascularisation procedure \n\n(coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for heart failure. \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and a composite microvascular outcome.  \n\n \n\nInsulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to \n\nstandard of care. There were no differences between insulin glargine and standard care for the two \n\nco-primary outcomes; for any component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all-cause mortality; \n\nor for the composite microvascular outcome.  \n\n \n\nMean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg. At baseline, participants had a median \n\nHbA1c value of 6.4% and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from 5.9 to 6.4% in the insulin \n\nglargine group, and 6.2% to 6.6% in the standard care group throughout the duration of follow-up.  \n\nThe rates of severe hypoglycaemia (affected participants per 100 participant years of exposure) were \n\n1.05 for insulin glargine and 0.30 for standard care group and the rates of confirmed non-severe \n\nhypoglycaemia were 7.71 for insulin glargine and 2.44 for standard care group. Over the course of this \n\n6-year study, 42% of the insulin glargine group did not experience any hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nAt the last on-treatment visit, there was a mean increase in body weight from baseline of 1.4 kg in the \n\ninsulin glargine group and a mean decrease of 0.8 kg in the standard care group.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a randomised, controlled clinical study, paediatric patients (age range 6 to 15 years) with type 1 \n\ndiabetes (n=349) were treated for 28 weeks with a basal-bolus insulin regimen where regular human \n\ninsulin was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH \n\nhuman insulin was administered once or twice daily. Similar effects on glycohemoglobin and the \n\nincidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia were observed in both treatment groups, however fasting \n\nplasma glucose decreased more from baseline in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. \n\nThere was less severe hypoglycaemia in the insulin glargine group as well. One hundred forty three of \n\nthe patients treated with insulin glargine in this study continued treatment with insulin glargine in an \n\nuncontrolled extension study with mean duration of follow-up of 2 years. No new safety signals were \n\nseen during this extended treatment with insulin glargine. \n\n \n\nA crossover study comparing insulin glargine plus lispro insulin to NPH plus regular human insulin \n\n(each treatment administered for 16 weeks in random order) in 26 adolescent type 1 diabetic patients \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\naged 12 to 18 years was also performed. As in the paediatric study described above, fasting plasma \n\nglucose reduction from baseline was greater in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. \n\nHbA1c changes from baseline were similar between treatment groups; however blood glucose values \n\nrecorded overnight were significantly higher in the insulin glargine/ lispro group than the NPH/regular \n\ngroup, with a mean nadir of 5.4 mM versus 4.1 mM. Correspondingly, the incidences of nocturnal \n\nhypoglycaemia were 32% in the insulin glargine / lispro group versus 52% in the NPH / regular group. \n\n \n\nA 24-week parallel group study was conducted in 125 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 2 to \n\n6 years, comparing insulin glargine given once daily in the morning to NPH insulin given once or \n\ntwice daily as basal insulin. Both groups received bolus insulin before meals. \n\nThe primary aim of demonstrating non-inferiority of insulin glargine to NPH in all hypoglycaemia was \n\nnot met and there was a trend to an increase of hypoglycemic events with insulin glargine [insulin \n\nglargine: NPH rate ratio (95% CI) = 1.18 (0.97-1.44)].  \n\nGlycohaemoglobin and glucose variabilities were comparable in both treatment groups. No new safety \n\nsignals were observed in this study. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects and diabetic patients, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much \n\nmore prolonged absorption and showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin \n\nglargine in comparison to human NPH insulin. Concentrations were thus consistent with the time \n\nprofile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine. The graph above shows the activity \n\nprofiles over time of insulin glargine and NPH insulin. \n\n \n\nInsulin glargine injected once daily will reach steady state levels in 2-4 days after the first dose. \n\n \n\nWhen given intravenously the elimination half-life of insulin glargine and human insulin were \n\ncomparable. \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous injection of Lantus in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized at \n\nthe carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 \n\n(21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating \n\ncompound is the metabolite M1. The exposure to M1 increases with the administered dose of Lantus. \n\nThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings indicate that the effect of the subcutaneous \n\ninjection with Lantus is principally based on exposure to M1. Insulin glargine and the metabolite M2 \n\nwere not detectable in the vast majority of subjects and, when they were detectable their concentration \n\nwas independent of the administered dose of Lantus. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety \n\nand efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetics in children aged 2 to less than 6 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus was assessed in \n\none clinical study (see section 5.1). Plasma \u201ctrough\u201d levels of insulin glargine and its main M1 and \n\nM2 metabolites were measured in children treated with insulin glargine, revealing plasma \n\nconcentration patterns similar to adults, and providing no evidence for accumulation of insulin \n\nglargine or its metabolites with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nLantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial  \n\nInsulin glargine \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus \n\n3. How to use Lantus \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Lantus \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. \n\n \n\nLantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of \n\nblood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus \n\n \n\nDo not use Lantus \n\n \n\n- If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus.  \n\nFollow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \n\nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the \n\nend of this leaflet). \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\n \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin \n\nmay not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor \n\nmay tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other \n\nantidiabetic medications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nBefore travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n\n- supplies of insulin, syringes etc., \n\n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n\n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n\n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n\n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n\n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\n \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, \n\nadjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \n\nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you \n\nrequire insulin. \n\n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and \n\ninsulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \n\nexperience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \n\nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nChildren \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lantus \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes,  \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure),  \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and \n\nlower fever),  \n\n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation),  \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),  \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). \n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \n \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nLantus with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n\n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n\n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n\n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Lantus  \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Lantus \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nAlthough Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these \n\nmedicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical \n\nprescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for \n\nfurther information. \n\n \n\nDose \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin \n\nusage, your doctor will: \n\n- determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time, \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n\n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. \n\n \n\nLantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting \n\ninsulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \n\nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \n\nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nLantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as \n\nyour doctor has told you.  \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nYou need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nLantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and \n\nmay cause hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, \n\nchange the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nLook at the vial before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, and has \n\nno visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other \n\ndisinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix Lantus with any other insulins or \n\nmedicines. Do not dilute it. Mixing or diluting may change the action of Lantus. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith Lantus, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist \n\n \n\nInsulin mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and \n\nother insulins.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Lantus than you should \n\n \n\n\uf02d If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia). \n\n Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more \n\nfood and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box \n\nat the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Lantus \n\n \n\n\uf02d If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood \n\nsugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n\uf02d Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Lantus \n\n \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take the action to increase \n\nyou blood sugar straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood \n\nsugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 \n\npeople). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood.  If your blood sugar \n\nlevel falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain \n\ndamage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nSevere allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \u2013 the signs may include \n\nlarge-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous \n\nmembranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and \n\nsweating. Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away \n\nif you notice signs of severe allergic reactions. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  Skin changes at the injection site:  \nIf you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up \n\nto 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the \n\nskin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often \n\nthis occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change \n\nthe injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. \n\n \n\nCommon reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site \nThe signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or \n\ninflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually \n\ndisappear in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nRare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n\uf0b7 General disorders \nIn rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling \n\nin the calves and ankles. \n\n \n\nVery rare reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\nIn very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nIn general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those \n\nseen in adults. \n\nComplaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions \n\n(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age \n\nor less than in adults. \n\nThere is no experience in children under 2 years. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Lantus \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). Do not freeze or place next to the freezer or a freezer pack. Keep the \n\nvial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nOpened vials \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nOnce in use, the 5 ml vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25\u00b0C \n\nand away from direct heat or direct light. \n\nOnce in use, the 10 ml vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above \n\n30\u00b0C and away from direct heat or direct light.  \n\nDo not use it after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be noted on the \n\nlabel. \n\n \n\nDo not use Lantus if you notice particles in it. Only use Lantus if the solution is clear, colourless and \n\nwaterlike. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n\n- you miss meals or delay them, \n\n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n\n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n\n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n\n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n\n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n\n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Lantus\"). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, (when \n\nchanging from your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more \n\nlikely to occur in the morning than at night) \n\n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n\n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n-In your body \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n-In your brain \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n\n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n\n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, \n\n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nLantus\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \n\ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \n\npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.  \n\nThe recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n\n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nLantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin glargine  \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. The instructions for using the insulin pen are provided with your \n\ninsulin pen. Refer to them before using your medicine. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus \n\n3. How to use Lantus \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Lantus \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nLantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. \n\n \n\nLantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of \n\nblood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus  \n\n \n\nDo not use Lantus \n\n \n\n- If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nLantus in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see also \n\nsection 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \n\nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the \n\nend of this leaflet). \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\n \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin \n\nmay not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nmay tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other \n\nantidiabetic medications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\n \n\nBefore travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about  \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,  \n\n- supplies of insulin, needles etc.,  \n\n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,  \n\n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,  \n\n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,  \n\n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n\n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries  \n\n \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, \n\nadjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  \n \n\nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you \n\nrequire insulin. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and \n\ninsulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \n\nexperience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \n\nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nChildren \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lantus \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and \n\nlower fever),  \n\n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  \n- somatropin (growth hormone),  \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine),  \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). \n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  \n \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nLantus with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n\n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n\n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n\n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Lantus  \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Lantus  \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nAlthough Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these \n\nmedicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical \n\nprescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for \n\nfurther information. \n\n \n\nDose \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin \n\nusage, your doctor will: \n\n- determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time, \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,  \n\n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. \n\n \n\nLantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting \n\ninsulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \n\nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \n\nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nLantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as \n\nyour doctor has told you. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nYou need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nLantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and \n\nmay cause hypoglycaemia.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, \n\nchange the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nLantus in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Lantus cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n\n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\nThe manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it in the pen. \n\n \n\nLook at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, \n\nand has no visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with Lantus, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.  \n\nDo not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. Do not mix \n\nLantus with any other insulins or medicines. Do not dilute it. Mixing or diluting may change the action \n\nof Lantus. \n\n \n\nProblems with the insulin pen? \n\n \n\nRefer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n\n \n\nInsulin mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and \n\nother insulins.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nIf you use more Lantus than you should \n\n \n\n- If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must \n\neat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see \n\nbox at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Lantus \n\n \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar \n\nlevel may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on \n\nthe treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Lantus \n\n \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase you \n\nblood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end if this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood \n\nsugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 \n\npeople). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood If your blood sugar level \n\nfalls too low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain \n\ndamage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nSevere allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \u2013 the signs may include \n\nlarge-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous \n\nmembranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and \n\nsweating. Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away \n\nif you notice signs of severe allergic reaction. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  Skin changes at the injection site:  \nIf you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up \n\nto 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the \n\nskin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often \n\nthis occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change \n\nthe injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. \n\n \n\nCommon reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site \nThe signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or \n\ninflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually \n\ndisappear in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nRare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Eye reactions \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n\uf0b7 General disorders \nIn rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling \n\nin the calves and ankles. \n\n \n\nVery rare reported side-effects (may affect up to1 in10,000 people) \n\nIn very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nIn general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those \n\nseen in adults. \n\nComplaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions \n\n(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age \n\nor less than in adults. \n\nThere is no experience in children under 2 years. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects  \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Lantus \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened cartridges \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). Do not freeze or place next to the freezer or a freezer pack. Keep the \n\ncartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  \n\n \n\nIn-use cartridges \n\nCartridges in use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not \n\nabove 30\u00b0C and away from direct heat or direct light. The cartridge in use must not be stored in a \n\nrefrigerator. Do not use it after this time period. \n\n \n\nDo not use Lantus if you notice particles in it. Only use Lantus if the solution is clear, colourless and \n\nwaterlike. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin.  \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?  \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.  \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur?  \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n\n- you miss meals or delay them, \n\n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n\n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n\n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n\n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n\n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,  \n\n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Lantus\"). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing \n\nfrom your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to \n\noccur in the morning than at night), \n\n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n\n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  \n\n \n\n- In your body \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.  \n\n \n\n- In your brain \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n\n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,  \n\n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, \n\n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nLantus\").  \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \n\ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \n\npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\nThe recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n\n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nLantus SoloStar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin glargine \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Lantus SoloStar, pre-filled \n\npen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus  \n\n3. How to use Lantus  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Lantus  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lantus is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. \n\n \n\nLantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of \n\nblood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lantus  \n\n \n\nDo not use Lantus \n\n \n\n- If you are allergic to insulin glargine or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nLantus in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). Speak to \n\nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \n\nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the \n\nend of this leaflet). \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\n \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin \n\nmay not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\nmay tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other \n\nantidiabetic medications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\n \n\nBefore travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about  \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,  \n\n- supplies of insulin, needles etc.,  \n\n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,  \n\n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,  \n\n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,  \n\n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n\n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries  \n\n \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, \n\nadjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \n\nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you \n\nrequire insulin. \n \nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and \n\ninsulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \n\nexperience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \n\nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nChildren \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lantus \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and \nlower fever), \n\n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),  \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). \n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \n \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nLantus with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you havehyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Lantus \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Lantus  \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nAlthough Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these \n\nmedicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical \n\nprescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for \n\nfurther information. \n\n \n\nDose \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin \n\nusage, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time. \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,  \n\n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. \n\n \n\nLantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting \n\ninsulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \n\nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \n\nor too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nLantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as \n\nyour doctor has told you. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nYou need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nLantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and \n\nmay cause hypoglycaemia.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, \n\nchange the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glargine. Lantus in pre-filled pen is only \n\nsuitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must \n\nuse the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  \n\n \n\nA new needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with \n\nSoloStar (see \u201cSoloStar Instructions for Use\u201d). \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nLook at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use SoloStar if you notice particles in it. Only use \n\nSoloStar if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike. Do not shake or mix it before use. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, never share your pen with anyone else. This pen is \n\nonly for your use. \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.  \n\n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If \n\nyou think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.  \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new \n\nSoloStar has to be used. \n\n \n\nInsulin mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and \n\nother insulins.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Lantus than you should \n\n \n\n\uf02d If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Lantus \n\n \n\n\uf02d If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood \n\nsugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For \n\ninformation on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n\uf02d Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Lantus \n\n \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf you notice signs of you blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your \n\nblood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood \n\nsugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 \n\npeople). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. If your blood sugar level \n\nfalls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain \n\ndamage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nSevere allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \u2013 the signs may include \n\nlarge-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous \n\nmembranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and \n\nsweating.Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away \n\nif you notice signs of severe allergic reaction. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  Skin changes at the injection site:  \nIf you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up \n\nto 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the \n\nskin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often \n\nthis occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change \n\nthe injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. \n\n \n\nCommon reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site \nThe signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or \n\ninflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually \n\ndisappear in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nRare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \n\n\uf0b7 Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n\uf0b7 General disorders \nIn rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling \n\nin the calves and ankles. \n\n \n\nVery rare reported side-effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\nIn very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nIn general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those \n\nseen in adults. \n\nComplaints of injection site reactions (injection site reaction, injection site pain) and skin reactions \n\n(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age \n\nor less than in adults. \n\nThere is no experience in children under 2 years. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Lantus  \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the pen \n\nafter \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nNot in-use pens \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). Do not freeze or place next to the freezer compartment or a freezer \n\npack. \n\nKeep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nIn use pens \n\nPre-filled pens in use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 30\u00b0C \n\nand away from direct heat or direct light.The pen in use must not be stored in the refrigerator Do not \n\nuse it after this time period.  \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin.  \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?  \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.  \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n\n- you miss meals or delay them, \n\n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n\n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n\n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n\n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n\n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,  \n\n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Lantus\"). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing \n\nfrom your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to \n\noccur in the morning than at night), \n\n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n\n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  \n\n \n\n- In your body \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.  \n\n \n\n- In your brain \n\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n\n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,  \n\n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, \n\n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nLantus\").  \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \n\ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \n\npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\nThe recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n\n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\nLantus SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. INSTRUCTION FOR USE \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from \n\na person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\n \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or \n\ncall the local representative number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\n \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with \nSoloStar. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. \n\n\uf0b7 Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). \n\n\uf0b7 This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  \n\n\uf0b7 If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to \navoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. \n\n\uf0b7 Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.  \n\n\uf0b7 Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. \n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. The Lantus Solostar \n\nis grey with a purple injection button. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n\n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. Lantus is a clear insulin. Do not use this SoloStar if the \n\ninsulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles. \n\n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, \ndepending on the needle type). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n\uf0b7 If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nStep 3. Perform a Safety test  \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n\uf0b7 ensuring that pen and needle work properly \n\n\uf0b7 removing air bubbles \n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them. \n\n\uf0b7 If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. \n\n\uf0b7 If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar. \n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows \u201c0\u201d following the safety test. \n\n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \n\nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\uf0b7 Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. \n \n\n\uf0b7 You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. \n\n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \n\nwill return to \u201c0\u201d as you inject. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \n\nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used.  \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n\uf0b7 Contamination and/or infection, \n\n\uf0b7 Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. \n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \n\nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n\uf0b7 If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. \n\nFollow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases. \n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely, as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n\n \n\nStorage instructions  \n\n \n\nSee the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.  \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. \n\nCold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.  \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\n \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\n \n\nIt should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are \n\nconcerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex IV \n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \n\nauthorisation(s) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\nScientific conclusions \n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for insulin glargine, the \n\nscientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n\nThe cumulative review of cutaneous amyloidosis included 29 cases of which 15 were well \n\ndocumented cases in which the event was confirmed with histopathology. These cases did not \n\ncontain confounders and have a compatible time to onset. Together with the available evidence \n\nfrom literature and text books, this signal contains sufficient evidence to establish an association \n\nbetween insulin glargine and cutaneous amyloidosis.  As cutaneous amyloidosis may lead to insulin \n\nresistance due to poor absorption from the infiltrated site, health care professionals and patients \n\nshould be informed of this event in the PI. Absorption of insulin could be improved by rotating the \n\ninjection site. The MAH is therefore requested to include the event cutaneous amyloidosis in the \n\nSmPC and PIL. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for insulin glargine the CHMP is of the opinion that the \n\nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing insulin glargine is unchanged subject to \n\nthe proposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using lantus. follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the end of this leaflet). skin changes at the injection site the injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. the insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see how to use lantus). contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. travel 38 before travelling consult your doctor. you may need to talk about - the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, - supplies of insulin, syringes etc., - correct storage of your insulin while travelling, - timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, - the possible effects of changing to different time zones, - possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, - what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. illnesses and injuries in the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): - if you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). - if you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). in most cases you will need a doctor. make sure that you contact a doctor early. if you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates. always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin. insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin). however, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). children there is no experience with the use of lantus in children below the age of 2 years. other medicines and lantus some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation). in each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high. be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what action, if any, you need to take. medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: - all other medicines to treat diabetes, - angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), - disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), - fluoxetine (used to treat depression), - fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), - monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (used to treat depression), - pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and lower fever), - sulfonamide antibiotics. medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: - corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), - danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), - diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), - diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), - glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), - isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), - oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), - phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), - somatropin (growth hormone), - sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma), - thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), - atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), - protease inhibitors (used to treat hiv). your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: - beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), - clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), - lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. if you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. lantus with alcohol your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. pregnancy and breast-feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. if you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet. driving and using machines your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: - you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), - you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), - you have problems with your sight. keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or using machines). you should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: - you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, - the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. important information about some of the ingredients of lantus this medicine contains less

although lantus contains the same active substance as toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these medicines are not interchangeable. the switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. please, consult your doctor for further information. dose based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will: - determine how much lantus per day you will need and at what time, - tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, - tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of lantus. lantus is a long-acting insulin. your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. many factors may influence your blood sugar level. you should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low. see the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. use in children and adolescents lantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. frequency of administration you need one injection of lantus every day, at the same time of the day. method of administration lantus is injected under the skin. do not inject lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and may cause hypoglycaemia. your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject lantus. with each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. how to handle the vials look at the vial before you use it. only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, and has no visible particles in it. do not shake or mix it before use. make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. do not mix lantus with any other insulins or medicines. do not dilute it. mixing or diluting may change the action of lantus. always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. this is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. if you think you may have a problem with lantus, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist insulin mix-ups you must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between lantus and other insulins. if you use more lantus than you should if you have injected too much lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. in general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. for information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. if you forget to use lantus if you have missed a dose of lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). check your blood sugar frequently. for information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using lantus this could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). do not stop lantus without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "lantus", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT",

signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take the action to increase you blood sugar straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. if your blood sugar level falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. for more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) the signs may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. tell a doctor straight away if you notice signs of severe allergic reactions. skin changes at the injection site: if you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). the insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) skin and allergic reactions at the injection site the signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation. this can spread around the injection site. most minor reactions to insulins usually disappear in a few days to a few weeks. rare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) eye reactions a marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily. if you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. general disorders in rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling in the calves and ankles. very rare reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) in very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. use in children and adolescents in general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those seen in adults. complaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less than in adults. there is no experience in children under 2 years. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "lantus", "Type":
