NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNplate 125 micrograms powder for solution for injection \nNplate 250 micrograms powder for solution for injection \nNplate 500 micrograms powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNplate 125 micrograms powder for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 125 mcg of romiplostim. After reconstitution, a deliverable volume of 0.25 mL \nsolution contains 125 mcg of romiplostim (500 mcg/mL). An additional overfill is included in each \nvial to ensure that 125 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered. \n \nNplate 250 micrograms powder for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 250 mcg of romiplostim. After reconstitution, a deliverable volume of 0.5 mL \nsolution contains 250 mcg of romiplostim (500 mcg/mL). An additional overfill is included in each \nvial to ensure that 250 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered. \n \nNplate 500 micrograms powder for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 500 mcg of romiplostim. After reconstitution, a deliverable volume of 1 mL \nsolution contains 500 mcg of romiplostim (500 mcg/mL). An additional overfill is included in each \nvial to ensure that 500 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered. \n \nRomiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli (E. coli). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNplate is indicated for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year \nof age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should remain under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the treatment of \nhaematological diseases. \n \nPosology \n \nNplate should be administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n\n\n 3\n\nInitial dose \n \nThe initial dose of romiplostim is 1 mcg/kg based on actual body weight. \n \nDose calculation \n \nThe volume of romiplostim to administer is calculated based on body weight, dose required, and \nconcentration of product. \n \nTable 1. Guidelines for calculating individual patient dose and volume of romiplostim to \nadminister \n \nIndividual patient dose \n(mcg) \n\nIndividual patient dose (mcg) = weight (kg) x dose in mcg/kg \n \nActual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when \ncalculating initial dose. \n\uf0b7 In adults, future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet \n\ncounts only. \n\uf0b7 In paediatric patients, future dose adjustments are based on changes \n\nin platelet counts and changes in body weight. Reassessment of \nbody weight is recommended every 12 weeks. \n \n\nIf individual patient \ndose is \u2265 23 mcg \n\nReconstitute lyophilised product as described in section 6.6. The resulting \nconcentration is 500 mcg/mL. \n \nVolume to administer (mL) = Individual patient dose (mcg) / 500 mcg/mL \n(Round volume to the nearest hundredth mL) \n \n\nIf individual patient \ndose is < 23 mcg \n\nDilution is required to ensure accurate dosing. Reconstitute lyophilised \nproduct and then dilute the product as described in section 6.6. The \nresulting concentration is 125 mcg/mL. \n \nVolume to administer (mL) = Individual patient dose (mcg) / 125 mcg/mL \n(Round volume to the nearest hundredth mL) \n \n\nExample 10 kg patient is initiated at 1 mcg/kg of romiplostim. \n \nIndividual patient dose (mcg) = 10 kg x 1 mcg/kg = 10 mcg \n \nBecause the dose is < 23 mcg, dilution is required to ensure accurate \ndosing. Reconstitute lyophilised product and then dilute the product as \ndescribed in section 6.6. The resulting concentration is 125 mcg/mL. \n \nVolume to administer (mL) = 10 mcg / 125 mcg/mL = 0.08 mL \n \n\n \nDose adjustments \n \nA subject\u2019s actual body weight at initiation of therapy should be used to calculate dose. The once \nweekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a \nplatelet count \u2265 50 x 109/L. Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count \n(\u2265 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should \nbe assessed monthly thereafter and appropriate dose adjustments made as per the dose adjustment \ntable (table 2) in order to maintain platelet counts within the recommended range. See table 2 below \nfor dose adjustment and monitoring. A maximum once weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg should not be \nexceeded. \n \n\n\n\n 4\n\nTable 2. Dose adjustment guidance based on platelet count \n \n\nPlatelet count \n(x 109/L) Action \n\n< 50 Increase once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg  \n\n> 150 for two \nconsecutive weeks Decrease once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg \n\n> 250 \n\nDo not administer, continue to assess the platelet count weekly \n \nAfter the platelet count has fallen to < 150 x 109/L, resume dosing with once \nweekly dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg\n\n \nDue to the interindividual variable platelet response, in some patients platelet count may abruptly fall \nbelow 50 x 109/L after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. In these cases, if clinically \nappropriate, higher cut-off levels of platelet count for dose reduction (200 x 109/L) and treatment \ninterruption (400 x 109/L) may be considered according to medical judgement. \n \nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim within the recommended \ndosing range should prompt a search for causative factors (see section 4.4, loss of response to \nromiplostim). \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nTreatment with romiplostim should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level \nsufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of romiplostim therapy at the highest \nweekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. \n \nPatients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on \nan individual basis by the treating physician, and in non-splenectomised patients this should include \nevaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is likely upon \ndiscontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \n \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed in patients < 65 and \u2265 65 years of age \n(see section 5.1). Although based on these data no adjustment of the dosing regimen is required for \nolder patients, care is advised considering the small number of elderly patients included in the clinical \ntrials so far. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim in children under the age of one year has not been established. \n \nPatients with hepatic Impairment \n \nRomiplostim should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nscore \u2265 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis in \npatients with thrombocytopenia associated to hepatic insufficiency treated with thrombopoietin (TPO) \nagonists (see section 4.4). \n \nIf the use of romiplostim is deemed necessary, platelet count should be closely monitored to minimise \nthe risk of thromboembolic complications. \n \n\n\n\n 5\n\nPatients with renal impairment \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in these patient populations. Nplate should be used with \ncaution in these populations. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nAfter reconstitution of the powder, Nplate solution for injection is administered subcutaneously. The \ninjection volume may be very small. Caution should be used during preparation of Nplate in \ncalculating the dose and reconstitution with the correct volume of sterile water for injection. If the \ncalculated individual patient dose is less than 23 mcg, dilution with preservative-free, sterile, sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is required to ensure accurate dosing (see section 6.6). \nSpecial care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate volume of Nplate is withdrawn from the \nvial for subcutaneous administration \u2013 a syringe with graduations of 0.01 mL should be used. \n \nSelf-administration of Nplate is not allowed for paediatric patients. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to E. coli \nderived proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nReoccurrence of thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment \n \nThrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. There is \nan increased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants \nor anti-platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and \nmedically managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. It is \nrecommended that, if treatment with romiplostim is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according \nto current treatment guidelines. Additional medical management may include cessation of \nanticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support. \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an \nincreased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. \nIncreased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can \nbe detected through bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, examinations for cellular morphological \nabnormalities using peripheral blood smear and complete blood count (CBC) prior to and during \ntreatment with romiplostim are recommended. See section 4.8 for information on the increases of \nreticulin observed in romiplostim clinical trials. \n \nIf a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, administration of \nromiplostim should be discontinued, a physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow \nbiopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be considered. If available, comparison to a prior \nbone marrow biopsy should be made. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is \nobserved in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including \nconsideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP \ntreatment options should be re-assessed. \n \n\n\n\n 6\n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n \nPlatelet counts above the normal range present a risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. \nThe incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events observed in clinical trials was 6.0% with \nromiplostim and 3.6% with placebo. Caution should be used when administering romiplostim to \npatients with known risk factors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. \nFactor V Leiden) or acquired risk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), \nadvanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and \nhormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. \n \nCases of thromboembolic events (TEEs), including portal vein thrombosis, have been reported in \npatients with chronic liver disease receiving romiplostim. Romiplostim should be used with caution in \nthese populations. Dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). \n \nMedication errors \n \nMedication errors including overdose and underdose have been reported in patients receiving Nplate, \ndose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines should be followed. In some paediatric patients, \naccurate dosing relies on an additional dilution step after reconstitution which may increase the risk \nfor medication errors (see section 4.2). \n \nOverdose may result in an excessive increase in platelet counts associated with \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, \ndiscontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with \ndosing and administration recommendations. Underdose may result in lower than expected platelet \ncounts and potential for bleeding. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients receiving Nplate (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). \n \nProgression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) \n \nA positive benefit/risk for romiplostim is only established for the treatment of thrombocytopenia \nassociated with chronic ITP and romiplostim must not be used in other clinical conditions associated \nwith thrombocytopenia. \n \nThe diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of \nother clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be \nexcluded. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should normally have been done over the course of the \ndisease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, for those with systemic symptoms \nor abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. \n \nIn adult clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient \nincreases in blast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were \nreported. In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects, treatment with romiplostim was \nprematurely stopped due to a numerical excess of disease progression to AML and an increase in \ncirculating blasts greater than 10% in patients receiving romiplostim. Of the cases of MDS disease \nprogression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were \nmore likely to have disease progression to AML compared to lower risk MDS. \n \nRomiplostim must not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause \nof thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials. \n \nLoss of response to romiplostim \n \nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment within the \nrecommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity \n(see section 4.8) and increased bone marrow reticulin (see above). \n \n\n\n\n 7\n\nEffects of romiplostim on red and white blood cells \n \nAlterations in red (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parameters have been observed in \nnon-clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) as well as in ITP patients. Concurrent anaemia and \nleucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but \nhave been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy. Monitoring of these \nparameters should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. The potential interactions of romiplostim with \nco-administered medicinal products due to binding to plasma proteins remain unknown. \n \nMedicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with romiplostim in clinical trials \nincluded corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and \nanti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining romiplostim with other \nmedicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the \nrecommended range (see section 4.2). \n \nCorticosteroids, danazol, and azathioprine use may be reduced or discontinued when given in \ncombination with romiplostim (see section 5.1). Platelet counts should be monitored when reducing or \ndiscontinuing other ITP treatments in order to avoid platelet counts below the recommended range \n(see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of romiplostim in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown that romiplostim crossed the placenta and increased foetal platelet \ncounts. Post implantation loss and a slight increase in peri-natal pup mortality also occurred in animal \nstudies (see section 5.3). \n \nRomiplostim is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether romiplostim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from romiplostim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no data available on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNplate has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In clinical trials, mild to \nmoderate, transient bouts of dizziness were experienced by some patients. \n \n\n\n\n 8\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled \nclinical trials, the overall subject incidence of all adverse reactions for romiplostim-treated subjects \nwas 91.5% (248/271). The mean duration of exposure to romiplostim in this study population was \n50 weeks. \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Nplate treatment include: reoccurrence of \nthrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment, increased bone marrow reticulin, \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications, medication errors and progression of existing MDS to \nAML. The most common adverse reactions observed include hypersensitivity reactions (including \ncases of rash, urticaria and angioedema) and headache. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The median duration of exposure was 65.4 weeks. The overall safety \nprofile was similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe paediatric adverse reactions are derived from each of the paediatric ITP randomised safety set \n(2 controlled clinical trials) and paediatric ITP safety set (2 controlled and 3 uncontrolled clinical \ntrials) where the subject incidence was at least 5% higher in the romiplostim arm compared to placebo \nand at least a 5% subject incidence in romiplostim-treated subjects. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and older were upper respiratory \ntract infection, rhinitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, \ncontusion (reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10)), and pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, \ngastroenteritis, sinusitis, purpura, urticaria and peripheral swelling (reported commonly (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10)). \n \nOropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis \nand peripheral swelling were additional adverse reactions observed in paediatric studies compared to \nthose seen in adult studies. \n \nSome of the adverse reactions seen in adults were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects such \nas cough, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and contusion reported very commonly (\u2265 1/10) in paediatric \nsubjects and purpura and urticaria were reported commonly (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn addition the reactions listed below have been deemed to be related to romiplostim treatment. \n \nBleeding events \n \nAcross the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and \nplatelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (\u2265 grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet \ncounts < 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events \u2265 grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No \nstatistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between \nNplate and placebo treated patients. \n \nIn the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered \nserious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% \nCI = (0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients \ntreated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; \n[romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% CI = (0.14, 0.85)). \n \nIn the Phase 3 paediatric study, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding episodes (see \nsection 5.1) was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm. \n \nThrombocytosis \n \nBased on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled \nclinical trials, 3 events of thrombocytosis were reported, n = 271. No clinical sequelae were reported \nin association with the elevated platelet counts in any of the 3 subjects. \n \nThrombocytosis in paediatric subjects occurred uncommonly (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), with a subject \nincidence of 1 (0.4%). Subject incidence was 1 (0.4%) for either grade \u2265 3 or serious thrombocytosis. \n \n\n\n\n 12\n\nThrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment \n \nBased on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled \nclinical trials, 4 events of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment were reported, n = 271 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nProgression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) \n \nIn a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS adult subjects treatment with romiplostim was \nprematurely stopped due to a numerical increase in cases of MDS disease progression to AML and \ntransient increases in blast cell counts in patients treated with romiplostim compared to placebo. Of the \ncases of MDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of \nMDS at baseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML (see section 4.4). Overall \nsurvival was similar to placebo. \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n \nIn adult clinical trials, romiplostim treatment was discontinued in 4 of the 271 patients because of \nbone marrow reticulin deposition. In 6 additional patients reticulin was observed upon bone marrow \nbiopsy (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an ongoing paediatric clinical trial, of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, \n5 out of 27 subjects (18.5%) developed increased reticulin in cohort 1 and 2 out of 4 subjects (50.0%) \ndeveloped increased reticulin in cohort 2. However, no subject showed any bone marrow \nabnormalities that were inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nClinical trials in adult ITP patients examined antibodies to romiplostim and TPO. While 5.7% \n(60/1,046) and 3.2% (33/1,046) of the subjects were positive for developing binding antibodies to \nromiplostim and TPO respectively, only 4 subjects were positive for neutralising antibodies to \nromiplostim but these antibodies did not cross react with endogenous TPO. Of the 4 subjects, \n2 subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the subject\u2019s last timepoint \n(transient positive) and 2 subjects remained positive at the subject\u2019s last timepoint (persistent \nantibodies). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim and TPO was 3.3% (35/1,046) \nand 3.0% (31/1,046), respectively. \n \nIn paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 9.6% \n(27/282). Of the 27 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim \nantibodies at baseline. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A \ntotal of 3.9% (11/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim \ntreatment. Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising antibodies to \nTPO.  One subject (0.35%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralising antibodies \nagainst TPO while on study (consistently negative for anti-romiplostim antibodies) with a negative \nresult at baseline. The subject showed a transient antibody response for neutralising antibodies against \nTPO, with a negative result at the subject\u2019s last timepoint tested within the study period. \n \nIn the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of \nbinding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive \nfor neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. A total of \n184 confirmed adult patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding \nantibody post treatment was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for \nneutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, \nnon-neutralising antibody against TPO. \n \n\n\n\n 13\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. If formation of neutralising \nantibodies is suspected, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (see \nsection 6 of the Package Leaflet) for antibody testing. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo adverse effects were seen in rats given a single dose of 1,000 mcg/kg or in monkeys after repeated \nadministration of romiplostim at 500 mcg/kg (100 or 50 times the maximum clinical dose of \n10 mcg/kg, respectively). \n \nIn the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, \ndiscontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with \ndosing and administration recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics, ATC code: B02BX04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRomiplostim is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular \ntranscriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production. \nThe peptibody molecule is comprised of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each \nsingle-chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 TPO \nreceptor-binding domains. \n \nRomiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO. In pre-clinical and clinical \ntrials no anti-romiplostim antibodies cross reacted with endogenous TPO. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim have been evaluated for up to 3 years of continuous treatment. \nIn clinical trials, treatment with romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet count. \nTime to reach the maximum effect on platelet count is approximately 10-14 days, and is independent \nof the dose. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg/kg romiplostim in ITP patients, the peak \nplatelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 to 3 week period \nand the response was variable among patients. The platelet counts of ITP patients who received \n6 weekly doses of 1 or 3 mcg/kg of romiplostim were within the range of 50 to 450 x 109/L for most \npatients. Of the 271 patients who received romiplostim in ITP clinical trials, 55 (20%) were age 65 \nand over, and 27 (10%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been \nobserved between older and younger patients in the placebo-controlled studies. \n \n\n\n\n 14\n\nResults from pivotal placebo-controlled studies \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies \nin adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry and are representative \nof the entire spectrum of such ITP patients. \n \nStudy S1 (212) evaluated patients who were non-splenectomised and had an inadequate response or \nwere intolerant to prior therapies. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 2 years at \nthe time of study entry. Patients had a median of 3 (range, 1 to 7) treatments for ITP prior to study \nentry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (90% of all patients), immunoglobulins (76%), \nrituximab (29%), cytotoxic therapies (21%), danazol (11%), and azathioprine (5%). Patients had a \nmedian platelet count of 19 x 109/L at study entry. \n \nStudy S2 (105) evaluated patients who were splenectomised and continued to have thrombocytopenia. \nPatients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 8 years at the time of study entry. In addition \nto a splenectomy, patients had a median of 6 (range, 3 to 10) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. \nPrior treatments included corticosteroids (98% of all patients), immunoglobulins (97%), rituximab \n(71%), danazol (37%), cytotoxic therapies (68%), and azathioprine (24%). Patients had a median \nplatelet count of 14 x 109/L at study entry. \n \nBoth studies were similarly designed. Patients (\u2265 18 years) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a \nstarting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients received single subcutaneous weekly \ninjections for 24 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. In both \nstudies, efficacy was determined by an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a durable \nplatelet response. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3 mcg/kg and for \nnon-splenectomised patients was 2 mcg/kg. \n \nA significantly higher proportion of patients receiving romiplostim achieved a durable platelet \nresponse compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study \nromiplostim maintained platelet counts \u2265 50 x 109/L in between 50% to 70% of patients during the \n6 month treatment period in the placebo-controlled studies. In the placebo group, 0% to 7% of patients \nwere able achieve a platelet count response during the 6 months of treatment.

Transient platelet \nresponse was defined as weekly platelet count \u2265 50 x 109/L for 4 or more times during study weeks 2-25 but \nwithout durable platelet response. Patient may not have a weekly response within 8 weeks after receiving any \nrescue medicinal products. \nc Number of weeks with platelet response is defined as number of weeks with platelet counts \u2265 50 x 109/L during \nstudy weeks 2-25. Patient may not have a weekly response within 8 weeks after receiving any rescue medicinal \nproducts. \nd Rescue therapies defined as any therapy administered to raise platelet counts. Patients requiring rescue \nmedicinal products were not considered for durable platelet response. Rescue therapies allowed in the study were \nIVIG, platelet transfusions, anti-D immunoglobulin, and corticosteroids. \ne Stable dose defined as dose maintained within \u00b1 1 mcg/kg during the last 8 weeks of treatment. \n \nResults of studies compared to standard of care (SOC) in non-splenectomised patients \n \nStudy S3 (131) was an open-label randomised 52 week trial in adult subjects who received \nromiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC) treatment. This study evaluated non-splenectomised \npatients with ITP and platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. Romiplostim was administered to 157 subjects by \nsubcutaneous (SC) injection once weekly starting at a dose of 3 mcg/kg, and adjusted throughout the \nstudy within a range of 1-10 mcg/kg in order to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 200 x 109/L, \n77 subjects received SOC treatment according to standard institutional practice or therapeutic \nguidelines. \n \nThe overall subject incidence rate of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim \ngroup compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs \nSOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35). \n \n\n\n\n 16\n\nThe overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim \ngroup compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs \nSOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61). \n \nOf the 157 subjects randomised to the romiplostim group, three subjects did not receive romiplostim. \nAmong the 154 subjects who received romiplostim, the total median exposure to romiplostim was \n52.0 weeks and ranged from 2 to 53 weeks. The most frequently used weekly dose was between \n3-5 mcg/kg (25th-75th percentile respectively; median 3 mcg/kg). \n \nOf the 77 subjects randomised to the SOC group, two subjects did not receive any SOC. Among the \n75 subjects who received at least one dose of SOC, the total median exposure to SOC was 51 weeks \nand ranged from 0.4 to 52 weeks. \n \nReduction in permitted concurrent ITP medical therapies \n \nIn both adult placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, patients already receiving ITP medical \ntherapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments \nthroughout the study (corticosteroids, danazol and/or azathioprine). Twenty-one non-splenectomised \nand 18 splenectomised patients received on-study ITP medical treatments (primarily corticosteroids) at \nthe start of study. All (100%) splenectomised patients who were receiving romiplostim were able to \nreduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue the concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of \nthe treatment period compared to 17% of placebo treated patients. Seventy-three percent of \nnon-splenectomised patients receiving romiplostim were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or \ndiscontinue concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of the study compared to 50% of placebo \ntreated patients (see section 4.5). \n \nBleeding events \n \nAcross the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and \nplatelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (\u2265 grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet \ncounts < 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events \u2265 grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No \nstatistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between \nNplate and placebo treated patients. \n \nIn the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered \nserious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% \nCI = (0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients \ntreated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; \n[romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% CI = (0.14, 0.85)). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit data for children < 1 year. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. \nStudy S4 (279) was a phase 3 study with 24 weeks of romiplostim treatment and study S5 (195) was a \nphase 1/2 study with 12 weeks of romiplostim treatment (up to 16 weeks for eligible responders who \nenter a 4-week pharmacokinetic assessment period). \n \nBoth studies enrolled paediatric subjects (\u2265 1 year to < 18 years of age) with thrombocytopenia \n(defined by a mean of 2 platelet counts \u2264 30 x 109/L with neither count > 35 x 109/L in both studies) \nwith ITP, regardless of splenectomy status. \n \nIn study S4, 62 subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 42) or placebo \n(n = 20) and stratified into 1 of 3 age cohorts. The starting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg and doses \nwere adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. The most frequently used weekly dose \nwas 3-10 mcg/kg and the maximum allowed dose on study was 10 mcg/kg. Patients received single \n\n\n\n 17\n\nsubcutaneous weekly injections for 24 weeks. Of those 62 subjects, 48 subjects had ITP > 12 months \nof duration (32 subjects received romiplostim and 16 subjects received placebo). \n \nThe primary endpoint was the incidence of durable response, defined as achieving at least 6 weekly \nplatelet counts of \u2265 50 x 109/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment. Overall, a significant greater \nproportion of subjects in the romiplostim arm achieved the primary endpoint compared with subjects \nin the placebo arm (p = 0.0018). A total of 22 subjects (52%) had durable platelet response in the \nromiplostim arm compared with 2 subjects (10%) in the placebo arm: \u2265 1 to < 6 years 38% versus \n25%; \u2265 6 to < 12 years 56% versus 11%; \u2265 12 to < 18 years 56% versus 0. \n \nIn the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the incidence of durable response was also \nsignificantly greater in the romiplostim arm compared with the placebo arm (p = 0.0022). A total of \n17 subjects (53.1%) had durable platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared with 1 subject \n(6.3%) in the placebo arm: \u2265 1 to < 6 years 28.6% versus 25%; \u2265 6 to < 12 years 63.6% versus 0%; \n\u2265 12 to < 18 years 57.1% versus 0%. \n \nThe composite bleeding episode was defined as clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a \nrescue medication to prevent a clinical significant bleeding event during weeks 2 through 25 of the \ntreatment period. A clinically significant bleeding event was defined as a Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade \u2265 2 bleeding event. The mean (SD) number of \ncomposite bleeding episodes was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm \nwith a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and \n0.5 (0, 4.5) in the placebo arm. In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the mean \n(SD) number of composite bleeding episodes was 2.1 (4.7) for the romiplostim arm and 4.2 (7.5) for \nthe placebo arm with a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim \narm and 0.0 (0, 4) in the placebo arm. Because the statistical testing for the incidence of rescue \nmedication use was not significant, no statistical test was done for the number of composite bleeding \nepisodes endpoint. \n \nIn study S5, 22 subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 17) or placebo \n(n = 5). Doses were increased in increments of 2 mcg/kg every 2 weeks and the target platelet count \nwas \u2265 50 x 109/L. Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence \nof platelet response compared with placebo (p = 0.0008). Of those 22 subjects, 17 subjects had \nITP > 12 months of duration (14 subjects received romiplostim and 3 subjects received placebo). \nTreatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence of platelet response \ncompared with placebo (p = 0.0147). \n \nPaediatric subjects who had completed a prior romiplostim study (including study S4) were allowed to \nenroll in study S6 (340), an open-label extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of long-term \ndosing of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP. \n \nA total of 66 subjects were enrolled in this study, including 54 subjects (82%) who had completed \nstudy S4. Of these, 65 subjects (98.5%) received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) \nduration of treatment was 135.0 weeks (95.0 weeks, 184.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average \nweekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg (1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent \ndose received by subjects during the treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg). Of \nthe 66 subjects enrolled in the study, 63 subjects had ITP > 12 months of duration. All the 63 subjects \nreceived at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) duration of treatment was 138.0 weeks \n(91.1 weeks, 186.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average weekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg \n(1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent dose received by subjects during \nthe treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg). \n \nAcross the study, the overall subject incidence of platelet response (1 or more platelet count \n\u2265 50 x 109/L in the absence of rescue medication) was 93.8% (n = 61) and was similar across age \ngroups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) number of months with platelet response was \n30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the median (Q1, Q3) time on study was 34.0 months \n\n\n\n 18\n\n(24.0 months, 46.0 months). Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with \nplatelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and was similar across age groups. \n \nIn the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the overall subject incidence of platelet \nresponse was 93.7% (n = 59) and was similar across age groups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, \nQ3) number of months with platelet response was 30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the \nmedian (Q1, Q3) time on study was 35.0 months (23.0 months, 47.0 months). Across all subjects, the \nmedian (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with platelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and \nwas similar across age groups. \n \nA total of 31 subjects (47.7%) used concurrent ITP therapy during the study including 23 subjects \n(35.4%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects (7.7%) who used concurrent ITP medication at \nbaseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP medication use showed a trend towards a reduction \nover the course of the study: from 30.8% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% \nfrom week 240 to the end of the study. \n \nIn the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, 29 subjects (46.0%) used concurrent ITP \ntherapy during the study including 21 subjects (33.3%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects \n(7.9%) who used concurrent ITP medication at baseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP \nmedication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course of the study: from 31.7% (weeks 1 \nto 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% from week 240 to the end of the study. \n \nThe subject prevalence of rescue medication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course \nof the study: from 24.6% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 13.0% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until \nthe end of the study. Similar reduction of the subject prevalence of rescue medication over the course \nof the study was seen in the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration: from 25.4% (weeks 1 \nto 12) to \u2264 13.1% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until the end of the study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involved target-mediated disposition, which is presumably \nmediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as \nmegakaryocytes. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of 3 to 15 mcg/kg romiplostim, maximum romiplostim serum \nlevels in ITP patients were obtained after 7-50 hours (median 14 hours). The serum concentrations \nvaried among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. Romiplostim serum levels \nappear inversely related to platelet counts. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution of romiplostim following intravenous administration of romiplostim \ndecreased nonlinearly from 122, 78.8, to 48.2 mL/kg for intravenous doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10 mcg/kg, \nrespectively in healthy subjects. This non-linear decrease in volume of distribution is in line with the \n(megakaryocyte and platelet) target-mediated binding of romiplostim, which may be saturated at the \nhigher doses applied. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination half-life of romiplostim in ITP patients ranged from 1 to 34 days (median, 3.5 days). \n \nThe elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a \nresult for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations \nand vice versa. In another ITP clinical trial, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed \nafter 6 weekly doses of romiplostim (3 mcg/kg). \n\n\n\n 19\n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPharmacokinetics of romiplostim in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not been \ninvestigated. Romiplostim pharmacokinetics appear not affected by age, weight and gender to a \nclinically significant extent. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic data of romiplostim were collected from two studies in 21 paediatric subjects with \nITP. In study S5 (195), romiplostim concentrations were available from 17 subjects at doses ranging \nfrom 1 to 10 mcg/kg. In Study S6 (340), intensive romiplostim concentrations were available from 4 \nsubjects (2 at 7 mcg/kg and 2 at 9 mcg/kg). Serum concentrations of romiplostim in paediatrics with \nITP were within the range observed in adult ITP subjects receiving the same dose range of \nromiplostim. Similar to adults with ITP, romiplostim pharmacokinetics are highly variable in \npaediatric subjects with ITP and are not reliable and predictive. However, the data are insufficient to \ndraw any meaningful conclusion relating to the impact of dose and age on the pharmacokinetics of \nromiplostim. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMultiple dose romiplostim toxicology studies were conducted in rats for 4 weeks and in monkeys for \nup to 6 months. In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic \nactivity of romiplostim and were similar regardless of study duration. Injection site reactions were also \nrelated to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at \nall tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week \npost-treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility. \n \nIn 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit \nand haemoglobin was observed. There was also a stimulatory effect on leukocyte production, as \nperipheral blood counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils were mildly \nincreased. In the longer duration chronic monkey study, there was no effect on the erythroid and \nleukocytic lineages when romiplostim was administered for 6 months where the administration of \nromiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly. Additionally, in the phase 3 pivotal \nstudies, romiplostim did not affect the red blood cell and white blood cells lineages relative to placebo \ntreated subjects. \n \nDue to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were \noften decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction \nof the antibodies with the measured concentrations. Although high doses were tested in the animal \nstudies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for \nthe pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins \ncannot be reliably estimated. \n \nCarcinogenesis \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated. Therefore, the risk of potential \ncarcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nIn all developmental studies neutralising antibodies were formed, which may have inhibited \nromiplostim effects. In embryo-foetal development studies in mice and rats, reductions in maternal \nbody weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. \nIn a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a \nslight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross \n\n\n\n 20\n\nthe placental barrier in rats and may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and \nstimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNplate 250 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection \nNplate 500 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNplate 250 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 250 mcg of romiplostim. After reconstitution, a deliverable volume of 0.5 mL \nsolution contains 250 mcg of romiplostim (500 mcg/mL). An additional overfill is included in each \nvial to ensure that 250 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered. \n \nNplate 500 micrograms powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 500 mcg of romiplostim. After reconstitution, a deliverable volume of 1 mL \nsolution contains 500 mcg of romiplostim (500 mcg/mL). An additional overfill is included in each \nvial to ensure that 500 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered. \n \nRomiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli (E. coli). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white. \nThe solvent is a clear colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNplate is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients \nwho are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should remain under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the treatment of \nhaematological diseases. \n \nPosology \n \nNplate should be administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection. \n \nInitial dose \n \nThe initial dose of romiplostim is 1 mcg/kg based on actual body weight. \n \n\n\n\n 24\n\nDose calculation \n \nInitial or subsequent \nonce weekly dose: \n\nWeight* in kg x Dose in mcg/kg = Individual patient dose in mcg \n\nVolume to administer: Dose in mcg x 1 mL = Amount to inject in mL 500 mcg\n \n\nExample: 75 kg patient is initiated at 1 mcg/kg of romiplostim. \nThe individual patient dose = \n75 kg x 1 mcg/kg = 75 mcg \nThe corresponding amount of Nplate solution to inject = \n\n75 mcg x 1 mL = 0.15 mL 500 mcg\n \n\n*Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating dose of romiplostim. \nFuture dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts only and made in 1 mcg/kg increments (see \ntable below). \n \nDose adjustments \n \nA subject\u2019s actual body weight at initiation of therapy should be used to calculate dose. The once \nweekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a \nplatelet count \u2265 50 x 109/L. Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count \n(\u2265 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should \nbe assessed monthly thereafter. A maximum once weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg should not be exceeded. \n \nAdjust the dose as follows: \n \n\nPlatelet count \n(x 109/L) Action \n\n< 50 Increase once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg  \n\n> 150 for two \nconsecutive weeks Decrease once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg \n\n> 250 \n\nDo not administer, continue to assess the platelet count weekly \n \nAfter the platelet count has fallen to < 150 x 109/L, resume dosing with once \nweekly dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg\n\n \nDue to the interindividual variable platelet response, in some patients platelet count may abruptly fall \nbelow 50 x 109/L after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. In these cases, if clinically \nappropriate, higher cut-off levels of platelet count for dose reduction (200 x 109/L) and treatment \ninterruption (400 x 109/L) may be considered according to medical judgement. \n \nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim within the recommended \ndosing range should prompt a search for causative factors (see section 4.4, loss of response to \nromiplostim). \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nTreatment with romiplostim should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level \nsufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of romiplostim therapy at the highest \nweekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. \n \nPatients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on \nan individual basis by the treating physician, and in non-splenectomised patients this should include \nevaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is likely upon \ndiscontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 25\n\nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \n \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed in patients < 65 and \u2265 65 years of age \n(see section 5.1). Although based on these data no adjustment of the dosing regimen is required for \nolder patients, care is advised considering the small number of elderly patients included in the clinical \ntrials so far. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim 250/500 mcg powder and solvent for solution for injection, \nalso used for self-administration in eligible adult patients, have not been established in patients aged \nunder 18 years. Self-administration of romiplostim is not allowed for paediatric patients. No data are \navailable. Other pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this \npopulation. \n \nPatients with hepatic Impairment \n \nRomiplostim should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nscore \u2265 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis in \npatients with thrombocytopenia associated to hepatic insufficiency treated with thrombopoietin (TPO) \nagonists (see section 4.4). \n \nIf the use of romiplostim is deemed necessary, platelet count should be closely monitored to minimise \nthe risk of thromboembolic complications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in these patient populations. Nplate should be used with \ncaution in these populations. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use. \n \nAfter reconstitution of the powder, Nplate solution for injection is administered subcutaneously. The \ninjection volume may be very small. Caution should be used during preparation of Nplate in \ncalculating the dose and reconstitution with the correct volume of sterile water for injection. Special \ncare should be taken to ensure that the appropriate volume of Nplate is withdrawn from the vial for \nsubcutaneous administration \u2013 a syringe with graduations of 0.01 mL should be used. \n \nPatients who have a stable platelet count \u2265 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment \nmay, at the discretion of the supervising physician, self-administer Nplate solution for injection. \nPatients eligible for self-administration of Nplate should be trained in these procedures. \n \nAfter the first 4 weeks of self-administration, the patient should again be supervised while \nreconstituting and administering Nplate. Only patients who demonstrate the ability to reconstitute and \nself-administer Nplate are allowed to continue doing so. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to E. coli \nderived proteins. \n \n\n\n\n 26\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nReoccurrence of thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment \n \nThrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. There is an \nincreased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants or \nanti-platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and medically \nmanaged to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. It is recommended \nthat, if treatment with romiplostim is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current \ntreatment guidelines. Additional medical management may include cessation of anticoagulant and/or \nantiplatelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support. \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an \nincreased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. \nIncreased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can \nbe detected through bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, examinations for cellular morphological \nabnormalities using peripheral blood smear and complete blood count (CBC) prior to and during \ntreatment with romiplostim are recommended. See section 4.8 for information on the increases of \nreticulin observed in romiplostim clinical trials. \n \nIf a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, administration of \nromiplostim should be discontinued, a physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow \nbiopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be considered. If available, comparison to a prior \nbone marrow biopsy should be made. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is \nobserved in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including \nconsideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP \ntreatment options should be re-assessed. \n \nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n \nPlatelet counts above the normal range present a risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. \nThe incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events observed in clinical trials was 6.0% with \nromiplostim and 3.6% with placebo. Caution should be used when administering romiplostim to \npatients with known risk factors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. \nFactor V Leiden) or acquired risk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), \nadvanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and \nhormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. \n \nCases of thromboembolic events (TEEs), including portal vein thrombosis, have been reported in \npatients with chronic liver disease receiving romiplostim. Romiplostim should be used with caution in \nthese populations. Dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). \n \nMedication Errors \n \nMedication errors including overdose and underdose have been reported in patients receiving Nplate, \ndose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). \n \nOverdose may result in an excessive increase in platelet counts associated with \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, \ndiscontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with \ndosing and administration recommendations. Underdose may result in lower than expected platelet \ncounts and potential for bleeding. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients receiving Nplate (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). \n \n\n\n\n 27\n\nProgression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) \n \nA positive benefit/risk for romiplostim is only established for the treatment of thrombocytopenia \nassociated with chronic ITP and romiplostim must not be used in other clinical conditions associated \nwith thrombocytopenia. \n \nThe diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of \nother clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be \nexcluded. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should normally have been done over the course of the \ndisease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, for those with systemic symptoms \nor abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. \n \nIn clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases in \nblast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were reported. In a \nrandomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects, treatment with romiplostim was prematurely \nstopped due to a numerical excess of disease progression to AML and an increase in circulating blasts \ngreater than 10% in patients receiving romiplostim. Of the cases of MDS disease progression to AML \nthat were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were more likely to have \ndisease progression to AML compared to lower risk MDS. \n \nRomiplostim must not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause \nof thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials. \n \nLoss of response to romiplostim \n \nA loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment within the \nrecommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity \n(see section 4.8) and increased bone marrow reticulin (see above). \n \nEffects of romiplostim on red and white blood cells \n \nAlterations in red (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parameters have been observed in \nnon-clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) as well as in ITP patients. Concurrent anaemia and \nleucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but \nhave been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy. Monitoring of these \nparameters should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. The potential interactions of romiplostim with \nco-administered medicinal products due to binding to plasma proteins remain unknown. \n \nMedicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with romiplostim in clinical trials \nincluded corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and \nanti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining romiplostim with other \nmedicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the \nrecommended range (see section 4.2). \n \nCorticosteroids, danazol, and azathioprine use may be reduced or discontinued when given in \ncombination with romiplostim (see section 5.1). Platelet counts should be monitored when reducing or \ndiscontinuing other ITP treatments in order to avoid platelet counts below the recommended range \n(see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n 28\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of romiplostim in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown that romiplostim crossed the placenta and increased foetal platelet \ncounts. Post implantation loss and a slight increase in peri-natal pup mortality also occurred in animal \nstudies (see section 5.3). \n \nRomiplostim is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether romiplostim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from romiplostim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no data available on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNplate has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In clinical trials, mild to \nmoderate, transient bouts of dizziness were experienced by some patients. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled \nclinical trials, the overall subject incidence of all adverse reactions for romiplostim-treated subjects \nwas 91.5% (248/271). The mean duration of exposure to romiplostim in this study population was \n50 weeks. \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Nplate treatment include: reoccurrence of \nthrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment, increased bone marrow reticulin, \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications, medication errors and progression of existing MDS to \nAML. The most common adverse reactions observed include hypersensitivity reactions (including \ncases of rash, urticaria and angioedema) and headache. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).

No clinical sequelae were reported \nin association with the elevated platelet counts in any of the 3 subjects. \n \nThrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment \n \nBased on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled \nclinical trials, 4 events of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment were reported, n = 271 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nProgression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) \n \nIn a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects treatment with romiplostim was prematurely \nstopped due to a numerical increase in cases of MDS disease progression to AML and transient \nincreases in blast cell counts in patients treated with romiplostim compared to placebo. Of the cases of \nMDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at \nbaseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML (see section 4.4). Overall survival was \nsimilar to placebo. \n \nIncreased bone marrow reticulin \n \nIn clinical trials, romiplostim treatment was discontinued in 4 of the 271 patients because of bone \nmarrow reticulin deposition. In 6 additional patients reticulin was observed upon bone marrow biopsy \n(see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nClinical trials in adult ITP patients examined antibodies to romiplostim and TPO. While 5.7% \n(60/1,046) and 3.2% (33/1,046) of the subjects were positive for developing binding antibodies to \nromiplostim and TPO respectively, only 4 subjects were positive for neutralising antibodies to \nromiplostim but these antibodies did not cross react with endogenous TPO. Of the 4 subjects, \n2 subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the subject\u2019s last timepoint \n(transient positive) and 2 subjects remained positive at the subject\u2019s last timepoint (persistent \nantibodies). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim and TPO was 3.3% (35/1,046) \nand 3.0% (31/1,046), respectively. \n \n\n\n\n 32\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. If formation of neutralising \nantibodies is suspected, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (see \nsection 6 of the Package Leaflet) for antibody testing. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo adverse effects were seen in rats given a single dose of 1,000 mcg/kg or in monkeys after repeated \nadministration of romiplostim at 500 mcg/kg (100 or 50 times the maximum clinical dose of \n10 mcg/kg, respectively). \n \nIn the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in \nthrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, \ndiscontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with \ndosing and administration recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics, ATC code: B02BX04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRomiplostim is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular \ntranscriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production. \nThe peptibody molecule is comprised of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each \nsingle-chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 TPO \nreceptor-binding domains. \n \nRomiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO. In pre-clinical and clinical \ntrials no anti-romiplostim antibodies cross reacted with endogenous TPO. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim have been evaluated for up to 3 years of continuous treatment. \nIn clinical trials, treatment with romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet count. \nTime to reach the maximum effect on platelet count is approximately 10-14 days, and is independent \nof the dose. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg/kg romiplostim in ITP patients, the peak \nplatelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 to 3 week period \nand the response was variable among patients. The platelet counts of ITP patients who received \n6 weekly doses of 1 or 3 mcg/kg of romiplostim were within the range of 50 to 450 x 109/L for most \npatients. Of the 271 patients who received romiplostim in ITP clinical trials, 55 (20%) were age 65 \nand over, and 27 (10%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been \nobserved between older and younger patients in the placebo-controlled studies. \n \n\n\n\n 33\n\nResults from pivotal placebo-controlled studies \n \nThe safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies \nin adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry and are representative \nof the entire spectrum of such ITP patients. \n \nStudy S1 (212) evaluated patients who were non-splenectomised and had an inadequate response or \nwere intolerant to prior therapies. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 2 years at \nthe time of study entry. Patients had a median of 3 (range, 1 to 7) treatments for ITP prior to study \nentry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (90% of all patients), immunoglobulins (76%), \nrituximab (29%), cytotoxic therapies (21%), danazol (11%), and azathioprine (5%). Patients had a \nmedian platelet count of 19 x 109/L at study entry. \n \nStudy S2 (105) evaluated patients who were splenectomised and continued to have thrombocytopenia. \nPatients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 8 years at the time of study entry. In addition \nto a splenectomy, patients had a median of 6 (range, 3 to 10) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. \nPrior treatments included corticosteroids (98% of all patients), immunoglobulins (97%), rituximab \n(71%), danazol (37%), cytotoxic therapies (68%), and azathioprine (24%). Patients had a median \nplatelet count of 14 x 109/L at study entry. \n \nBoth studies were similarly designed. Patients (\u2265 18 years) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a \nstarting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients received single subcutaneous weekly \ninjections for 24 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. In both \nstudies, efficacy was determined by an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a durable \nplatelet response. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3 mcg/kg and for \nnon-splenectomised patients was 2 mcg/kg. \n \nA significantly higher proportion of patients receiving romiplostim achieved a durable platelet \nresponse compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study \nromiplostim maintained platelet counts \u2265 50 x 109/L in between 50% to 70% of patients during the \n6 month treatment period in the placebo-controlled studies. In the placebo group, 0% to 7% of patients \nwere able achieve a platelet count response during the 6 months of treatment.

Rescue therapies allowed in the study were \nIVIG, platelet transfusions, anti-D immunoglobulin, and corticosteroids. \ne Stable dose defined as dose maintained within \u00b1 1 mcg/kg during the last 8 weeks of treatment. \n \nResults of studies compared to standard of care (SOC) in non-splenectomised patients \n \nStudy S3 (131) was an open-label randomised 52 week trial in subjects who received romiplostim or \nmedical standard of care (SOC) treatment. This study evaluated non-splenectomised patients with ITP \nand platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. Romiplostim was administered to 157 subjects by subcutaneous (SC) \ninjection once weekly starting at a dose of 3 mcg/kg, and adjusted throughout the study within a range \nof 1-10 mcg/kg in order to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 200 x 109/L, 77 subjects received \nSOC treatment according to standard institutional practice or therapeutic guidelines. \n \nThe overall subject incidence rate of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim \ngroup compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs \nSOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35). \n \nThe overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim \ngroup compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs \nSOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61). \n\n\n\n 35\n\n \nOf the 157 subjects randomised to the romiplostim group, three subjects did not receive romiplostim. \nAmong the 154 subjects who received romiplostim, the total median exposure to romiplostim was \n52.0 weeks and ranged from 2 to 53 weeks. The most frequently used weekly dose was between \n3-5 mcg/kg (25th-75th percentile respectively; median 3 mcg/kg). \n \nOf the 77 subjects randomised to the SOC group, two subjects did not receive any SOC. Among the \n75 subjects who received at least one dose of SOC, the total median exposure to SOC was 51 weeks \nand ranged from 0.4 to 52 weeks. \n \nReduction in permitted concurrent ITP medical therapies \n \nIn both placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a \nconstant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the \nstudy (corticosteroids, danazol and/or azathioprine). Twenty-one non-splenectomised and \n18 splenectomised patients received on-study ITP medical treatments (primarily corticosteroids) at the \nstart of study. All (100%) splenectomised patients who were receiving romiplostim were able to \nreduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue the concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of \nthe treatment period compared to 17% of placebo treated patients. Seventy-three percent of \nnon-splenectomised patients receiving romiplostim were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or \ndiscontinue concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of the study compared to 50% of placebo \ntreated patients (see section 4.5). \n \nBleeding events \n \nAcross the entire ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and platelet \ncounts was observed. All clinically significant (\u2265 grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet counts \n< 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events \u2265 grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No statistically \nsignificant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between Nplate and \nplacebo treated patients. \n \nIn the two placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered serious \n(5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% CI = (0.15, \n2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients treated with \nromiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% \nCI = (0.14, 0.85)). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nNplate in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of immune \nthrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involved target-mediated disposition, which is presumably \nmediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as \nmegakaryocytes. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of 3 to 15 mcg/kg romiplostim, maximum romiplostim serum \nlevels in ITP patients were obtained after 7-50 hours (median 14 hours). The serum concentrations \nvaried among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. Romiplostim serum levels \nappear inversely related to platelet counts. \n \n\n\n\n 36\n\nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution of romiplostim following intravenous administration of romiplostim \ndecreased nonlinearly from 122, 78.8, to 48.2 mL/kg for intravenous doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10 mcg/kg, \nrespectively in healthy subjects. This non-linear decrease in volume of distribution is in line with the \n(megakaryocyte and platelet) target-mediated binding of romiplostim, which may be saturated at the \nhigher doses applied. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination half-life of romiplostim in ITP patients ranged from 1 to 34 days (median, 3.5 days). \nThe elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a \nresult for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations \nand vice versa. In another ITP clinical trial, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed \nafter 6 weekly doses of romiplostim (3 mcg/kg). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPharmacokinetics of romiplostim in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not been \ninvestigated. Romiplostim pharmacokinetics appear not affected by age, weight and gender to a \nclinically significant extent. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMultiple dose romiplostim toxicology studies were conducted in rats for 4 weeks and in monkeys for \nup to 6 months. In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic \nactivity of romiplostim and were similar regardless of study duration. Injection site reactions were also \nrelated to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at \nall tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week \npost-treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility. \n \nIn 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit \nand haemoglobin was observed. There was also a stimulatory effect on leukocyte production, as \nperipheral blood counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils were mildly \nincreased. In the longer duration chronic monkey study, there was no effect on the erythroid and \nleukocytic lineages when romiplostim was administered for 6 months where the administration of \nromiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly. Additionally, in the phase 3 pivotal \nstudies, romiplostim did not affect the red blood cell and white blood cells lineages relative to placebo \ntreated subjects. \n \nDue to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were \noften decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction \nof the antibodies with the measured concentrations. Although high doses were tested in the animal \nstudies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for \nthe pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins \ncannot be reliably estimated. \n \nCarcinogenesis \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated. Therefore, the risk of potential \ncarcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nIn all developmental studies neutralising antibodies were formed, which may have inhibited \nromiplostim effects. In embryo-foetal development studies in mice and rats, reductions in maternal \nbody weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. \n\n\n\n 37\n\nIn a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a \nslight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross \nthe placental barrier in rats and may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and \nstimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats. \n \n \n6.

What Nplate is and what it is used for \n \nNplate\u2019s active ingredient is romiplostim, which is a protein used to treat low platelet counts in \npatients with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (called ITP). ITP is a disease in which \nyour body\u2019s immune system destroys its own platelets. Platelets are the cells in your blood that help \nseal cuts and form blood clots. Very low platelet counts can cause bruising and serious bleeding. \n \nNplate is used to treat patients aged 1 year and over who may or may not have had their spleen \nremoved for chronic ITP and who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or \nimmunoglobulins, where these treatments don\u2019t work. \n \nNplate works by stimulating the bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce \nmore platelets. This should help to prevent bruising and bleeding associated with ITP. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Nplate \n \nDo not use Nplate: \n \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to romiplostim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to other medicines that are produced by DNA technology using the \n\nmicro-organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\uf0b7 If you stop taking Nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. If \n\nyou stop taking Nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will \ndiscuss appropriate precautions with you. \n\n\n\n 73\n\n\uf0b7 If you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. The risk of blood \nclotting may also be increased if you: \n- have liver problems; \n- are elderly (\u2265 65 years); \n- are bedridden; \n- have cancer; \n- are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; \n- have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; \n- are obese (overweight); \n- are a smoker. \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nplate. \n \nIf you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Your doctor \nwill adjust your dose of Nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. \n \nBone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) \n \nLong-term use of Nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. These changes may lead to \nabnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. The mild form of these bone marrow \nchanges is called \u201cincreased reticulin\u201d and has been observed in Nplate clinical trials. It is not known \nif this may progress to a more severe form called \u201cfibrosis.\u201d Signs of bone marrow changes may show \nup as abnormalities in your blood tests. Your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you \nshould have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking Nplate. \n \nWorsening of blood cancers \n \nYour doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you \nhave ITP, and not another condition such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). If you have MDS and \nreceive Nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your MDS condition may \nworsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. \n \nLoss of response to romiplostim \n \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim \ntreatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing \nincreased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim\u2019s \nactivity. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNplate is not recommended for use in children aged under 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Nplate \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy) \nthere is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nIf you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat \nyour ITP, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with Nplate. \n \n\n\n\n 74\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Nplate is not recommended for use if \nyou are pregnant unless indicated by your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether romiplostim is present in human milk. Nplate is not recommended for use if \nyou are breast-feeding. A decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue therapy \nwith romiplostim should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to your child and \nthe benefit of romiplostim therapy to you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYou should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects (e.g. \ntemporary bouts of dizziness) may impair your ability to do so safely. \n \n \n3. How to use Nplate \n \nAdult and children (1 to 17 years): \n \nNplate will be given under the direct supervision of your doctor, who will closely control the amount \nof Nplate given to you. \n \nNplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). \n \nYour initial dose is 1 microgram of Nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. Your \ndoctor will tell you how much you must take. Nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep \nyour platelet counts up. Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are \nresponding and may adjust your dose as necessary. \n \nOnce your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. \nYour dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. \n \nChildren (1 to 17 years old): in addition to adjusting your dose based on platelet counts, your doctor \nwill also regularly reassess your body weight in order to adjust your dose. \n \nIf you use more Nplate than you should \n \nYour doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given more \nNplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts \nmay rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Therefore if your doctor \nsuspects that you have been given more Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are \nmonitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment \nimmediately. \n \nIf you use less Nplate than you should \n \nYour doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given less \nNplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts \nmay become low and this may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore if your doctor suspects that you \nhave been given less Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs \nor symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 75\n\nIf you forget to use Nplate \n \nIf you have missed a dose of Nplate, your doctor will discuss with you when you should have your \nnext dose. \n \nIf you stop using Nplate \n \nIf you stop using Nplate, your low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should stop using Nplate. \n \n \n4.

Nplate should be \nreconstituted in accordance with good aseptic practice. \n \n\uf0b7 Nplate 125 micrograms powder for solution for injection should be reconstituted with \n\n0.44 mL sterile water for injections, yielding a deliverable volume of 0.25 mL. An additional \nover fill is included in each vial to ensure that 125 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered (see \nvial content table below). \n\nor \n\uf0b7 Nplate 250 micrograms powder for solution for injection should be reconstituted with \n\n0.72 mL sterile water for injections, yielding a deliverable volume of 0.5 mL. An additional \noverfill is included in each vial to ensure that 250 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered (see vial \ncontent table below). \n\nor \n\uf0b7 Nplate 500 micrograms powder for solution for injection should be reconstituted with \n\n1.2 mL sterile water for injections, yielding a deliverable volume of 1 mL. An additional \noverfill is included in each vial to ensure that 500 mcg of romiplostim can be delivered (see vial \ncontent table below). \n\n \n\n\n\n 81\n\nVial Content: \n \nNplate single- \nuse vial \n\nTotal vial \ncontent of \nromiplostim  \n\n Volume of \nsterile water \nfor injection  \n\n Deliverable \nproduct and \nvolume \n\nFinal \nconcentration \n\n125 mcg 230 mcg + 0.44 mL = 125 mcg in 0.25 mL 500 mcg/mL\n250 mcg 375 mcg + 0.72 mL = 250 mcg in 0.50 mL 500 mcg/mL\n500 mcg 625 mcg + 1.20 mL = 500 mcg in 1.00 mL 500 mcg/mL\n \nSterile water for injections only should be used when reconstituting the medicinal product. Sodium \nchloride solutions or bacteriostatic water should not be used when reconstituting the medicine. \n \nWater for injections should be injected into the vial. The vial contents may be swirled gently and \ninverted during dissolution. The vial should not be shaken or vigorously agitated. Generally, \ndissolution of Nplate takes less than 2 minutes. Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration before administration.

What you need to know before you use Nplate \n3. How to use Nplate \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Nplate \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate \n \n \n1. What Nplate is and what it is used for \n \nNplate\u2019s active ingredient is romiplostim, which is a protein used to treat low platelet counts in \npatients with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (called ITP). ITP is a disease in which \nyour body\u2019s immune system destroys its own platelets. Platelets are the cells in your blood that help \nseal cuts and form blood clots. Very low platelet counts can cause bruising and serious bleeding. \n \nNplate is used to treat adult patients (aged 18 years and over) who may or may not have had their \nspleen removed for chronic ITP and who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or \nimmunoglobulins, where these treatments don\u2019t work. \n \nNplate works by stimulating the bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce \nmore platelets. This should help to prevent bruising and bleeding associated with ITP. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Nplate \n \nDo not use Nplate: \n \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to romiplostim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to other medicines that are produced by DNA technology using the \n\nmicro-organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\uf0b7 If you stop taking Nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. If \n\nyou stop taking Nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will \ndiscuss appropriate precautions with you. \n\n\n\n 83\n\n\uf0b7 If you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. The risk of blood \nclotting may also be increased if you: \n- have liver problems; \n- are elderly (\u2265 65 years); \n- are bedridden; \n- have cancer; \n- are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; \n- have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; \n- are obese (overweight); \n- are a smoker. \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nplate. \n \nIf you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Your doctor \nwill adjust your dose of Nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. \n \nBone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) \n \nLong-term use of Nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. These changes may lead to \nabnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. The mild form of these bone marrow \nchanges is called \u201cincreased reticulin\u201d and has been observed in Nplate clinical trials. It is not known \nif this may progress to a more severe form called \u201cfibrosis.\u201d Signs of bone marrow changes may show \nup as abnormalities in your blood tests. Your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you \nshould have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking Nplate. \n \nWorsening of blood cancers \n \nYour doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you \nhave ITP, and not another condition such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). If you have MDS and \nreceive Nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your MDS condition may \nworsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. \n \nLoss of response to romiplostim \n \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim \ntreatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing \nincreased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim\u2019s \nactivity. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNplate is not recommended for use in children below age 18. \n \nOther medicines and Nplate \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIf you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or anti-platelet therapy) \nthere is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nIf you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat \nyour ITP, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with Nplate. \n \n\n\n\n 84\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Nplate is not recommended for use if \nyou are pregnant unless indicated by your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether romiplostim is present in human milk. Nplate is not recommended for use if \nyou are breast-feeding. A decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue therapy \nwith romiplostim should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to your child and \nthe benefit of romiplostim therapy to you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYou should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects (e.g. \ntemporary bouts of dizziness) may impair your ability to do so safely. \n \n \n3. How to use Nplate \n \nNplate will be given under the direct supervision of your doctor, who will closely control the amount \nof Nplate given to you. \n \nNplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). \n \nYour initial dose is 1 microgram of Nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. Your \ndoctor will tell you how much you must take. Nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep \nyour platelet counts up. Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are \nresponding and may adjust your dose as necessary. \n \nOnce your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. \nYour dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. \n \nAlways use Nplate exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure of how to use Nplate. \n \nInstructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate \n \nAfter suitable training, your doctor may also allow you to inject Nplate yourself. Please read the \ninstructions at the end of this leaflet on how to inject Nplate, as discussed with your doctor. If your \ndoctor has allowed you to self-inject, you should follow up with your doctor every month to have the \ndoctor determine if Nplate is working for you or if another treatment needs to be considered. \n \nAfter the first month of self-injecting Nplate, you will need to show that you can still prepare and \ninject Nplate correctly. \n \nIf you use more Nplate than you should \n \nYour doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given more \nNplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts \nmay rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Therefore if your doctor \nsuspects that you have been given more Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are \nmonitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment \nimmediately. \n \nIf your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you use more Nplate than you should, then inform \nyour doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 85\n\nIf you use less Nplate than you should \n \nYour doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given less \nNplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts \nmay become low and this may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore if your doctor suspects that you \nhave been given less Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs \nor symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. \n \nIf your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you use less Nplate than you should, then inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Nplate \n \nIf you have missed a dose of Nplate, your doctor will discuss with you when you should have your \nnext dose. \n \nIf your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you forget to give yourself an injection, you should \ninform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you stop using Nplate \n \nIf you stop using Nplate, your low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. Your \ndoctor will decide if you should stop using Nplate. \n \nInjecting Nplate yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it is best for you to inject Nplate. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will \nshow you how to inject yourself with Nplate. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. \nIt is very important that you prepare Nplate properly and take the correct dose (see section 7. \nInstructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate, at the end of this leaflet). \n \n \n4.

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate \n \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Nplate. It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nfor assistance. It is very important the product is prepared correctly and the correct dose is taken. \n \nThis section is divided into the following subsections: \n \nBefore you begin \nStep 1. Set up materials for an injection \nStep 2. Prepare vial for use, attach vial adapter \nStep 3. Prepare sterile water syringe \nStep 4. Dissolving Nplate by injecting water into vial \nStep 5. Prepare new syringe for injection \nStep 6. Prepare injection needle \nStep 7. Choose and prepare an injection site \nStep 8. Injecting the Nplate liquid \nStep 9. Disposing of supplies \n \nBefore you begin \n \nRead all instructions for use thoroughly. These instructions are for patients who are already trained \nby their healthcare professional, such as your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, in self injection. If you \nhave not been trained, please contact your healthcare professional. \n \nThe Nplate self injection kit must be kept in the original package until use in order to protect the \nNplate vial from light. Keep the Nplate self injection kit refrigerated at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC. \n \nOnce Nplate has been dissolved, inject immediately. \n\n\n\n 91\n\n \nYou may have excess Nplate left over after administering your prescribed dose. Do not re-use Nplate! \nAny excess dissolved Nplate must be thrown away immediately after completing the injection process. \nLeft over Nplate in vial must NEVER be re-used for another injection. \n \nStep 1. Set up materials for an injection \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Select a well lit, flat work surface, such as a table. \n \n\uf0b7 Take the Nplate self injection kit out of the refrigerator. Do not use if frozen. If you have any \n\nquestions about storage, contact your healthcare professional for further instructions. Check the \nexpiry date on the self injection kit. If the expiry date has passed, do not use. Stop and \ncontact your healthcare professional. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Note: If your healthcare professional has instructed you that your Nplate dose requires more \n\nthan one injection of Nplate, you will need to use more than one self injection kit. Follow the \nsteps as described in this leaflet and use as many self injection kits as necessary to complete \nyour prescribed dose of Nplate. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Make sure you have the following items: \n \nAlcohol swab package x4\n\n \n\n \n\n \nA vial of powder, either 250 micrograms OR \n500 micrograms x1 \n\n13 mm vial adapter x1 \n\n  \n \nPlunger rod for pre-filled sterile water syringe x1 Pre-filled sterile water syringe x1 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 92\n\n1 mL Luer-lock tip syringe x1 Injection safety needle x1 \n\n \n \n\uf0b7 Do not open items until directed in instructions. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not use components that have evidence of tampering or damage. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not re-use items. \n \nStep 2. Prepare vial for use, attach vial adapter \n \nUsing: 2 alcohol swab packages, 1 vial, and 1 vial adapter package. \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Wash your hands with soap and warm \n\nwater. \n \n\uf0b7 Clean the flat work surface with a new \n\nalcohol swab. \n \n\uf0b7 Remove red (250 micrograms) or blue \n\n(500 micrograms) plastic cap from vial.  \n \n\uf0b7 Using a new alcohol swab clean vial \n\nstopper. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not touch vial stopper after cleaning it. \n\n \n\n\n\n 93\n\n\uf0b7 Peel off paper backing slowly from vial \nadapter while keeping vial adapter in the \nplastic package. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do not touch vial stopper or spike of vial \n\nadapter. \n\n \n \n\uf0b7 Keeping the vial on a table, and keeping the \n\nvial adapter in the plastic packaging, line up \nspike on the vial adapter to the centre of \nthe stopper on the vial. \n\n  \n\uf0b7 Push the vial adapter down onto the vial \n\nuntil it is firmly in place and you can\u2019t push \ndown any more. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Lift off plastic vial adapter packaging, \n\nleaving vial adapter on vial. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not touch the top of vial adapter. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 94\n\nStep 3. Prepare sterile water syringe \n \nUsing: Pre-filled sterile water syringe and plunger rod. \n \nBefore you begin Step 3 please note the following: \n \n\uf0b7 The clear plastic plunger rod MUST always be attached first before breaking the white tip off of \n\nthe pre-filled water syringe. Perform step 3a before step 3b. \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Step 3a: Attach clear plastic plunger rod \n\nto pre-filled sterile water syringe by \nplacing the threaded end of the plunger rod \ninto the syringe and carefully twisting the \nrod clockwise onto the grey syringe plunger, \nuntil you feel a slight resistance. Do not over \ntighten. \n\n \n\n \n\uf0b7 Step 3b: Holding the syringe with one \n\nhand, bend the tip of the white plastic \ncover downward with your other hand. \nThis will break the seal of the white plastic \ncover. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Once the seal is broken, pull the white \n\nplastic cover off. You will see grey rubber \nin the cap. \n\n \n\n \nStep 4. Dissolving Nplate by injecting water into vial \n \nUsing: Pre-filled sterile water syringe and vial with vial adapter attached. \n \nBefore you begin Step 4 please note the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Do dissolve slowly and carefully. This is a protein product and proteins can be easily damaged \n\nby improper mixing and excessive shaking. \n \n\n\n\n 95\n\nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Keeping the vial on the table, attach \n\nwater-filled syringe to vial adapter by \nholding the side of the vial adapter with one \nhand and twisting the syringe tip clockwise \nonto the adapter with the other hand until \nyou feel a slight resistance. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Very slowly and gently push down on \n\nplunger rod to inject all water in the \nsyringe into the vial. Water must flow \nslowly onto powder. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do not force the water into the vial. \n \n\uf0b7 Note: After injecting the water into the vial \n\nit is common for the plunger to move back \nup. You do not have to maintain pressure on \nthe plunger for the rest of Step 4. \n\n \n Push slowly and gently \n \n\n\n\n 96\n\nBefore continuing: \n \n\uf0b7 Do ensure that all water is injected from the syringe into the vial before dissolving. \n \n\uf0b7 Holding the area where the vial and vial \n\nadapter connect between your fingers, \ngently swirl the vial by rotating your wrist \nuntil all of the powder has dissolved and \nthe liquid in the vial is clear and \ncolourless. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do gently swirl the vial. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not shake the vial. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not roll vial between palms. \n \n\uf0b7 Note: It may take up to 2 minutes for the \n\npowder to completely dissolve. \n \n\nCorrect \n \n\n \n\n Incorrect  \n \nBefore continuing: \n \n\uf0b7 Do visually inspect the dissolved liquid for particles and/or discolouration. It must be clear and \n\ncolourless and fully dissolved. \n \n\uf0b7 Note: If there is any colour or particles in the liquid, contact your healthcare professional. \n \n\uf0b7 Do make sure liquid is fully dissolved before removing syringe. \n \n\uf0b7 When Nplate is completely dissolved, \n\nremove the empty syringe by twisting it \nanti-clockwise off of the vial adapter. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Discard the empty syringe into sharps or hazard container. Keep the dissolved Nplate Vial. \n\nImmediately prepare new syringe for injection. \n \n\n\n\n 97\n\n\uf0b7 Do not delay injecting Nplate. \n \nStep 5. Prepare new syringe for injection \n \nUsing: A new 1 mL syringe package and the vial of dissolved, clear Nplate. \n \nBefore continuing: \n \n\uf0b7 Do check your dose before starting this step. \n \n\uf0b7 Note: The Nplate liquid is highly potent which is why accuracy and dose measurement are \n\nimportant. \n \n\uf0b7 Do make sure that all air bubbles are removed before injection. \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Remove 1 mL syringe from package. \n \n\uf0b7 Draw air into syringe to 1 mL marking. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not pull plunger back to more than 1 mL. \n\n Draw air into syringe to the 1 mL mark \n \n\uf0b7 Attach 1 mL syringe to vial adapter of the \n\ndissolved Nplate by twisting the syringe tip \nclockwise onto the vial adapter until you feel \na slight resistance. \n\n \n\n\n\n 98\n\nA. Push air into vial. \n \nB. Maintain pressure on plunger. \n \nC. Turn vial assembly and syringe upside \n\ndown, so the vial is directly above the \nsyringe. \n\n A. B. C. \nFlip \n\n \n\uf0b7 Withdraw the full amount of liquid into \n\nthe syringe. \n \n\n-  The maximum deliverable volume for \nthe 250 microgram vial is 0.5 mL and \nfor the 500 microgram vial is 1 mL. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do not pull the plunger out of the back of \n\nthe syringe. \n \n\n \n \n\uf0b7 Do ensure that the plunger remains in the \n\nsyringe. \n\n Correct \n \n\n\n\n 99\n\n\uf0b7 Check and remove all air bubbles in the \nsyringe. \n-  Gently tap the syringe with your \n\nfingers to separate the bubbles from \nthe liquid. \n\n \n-  Slowly push the plunger up to force \n\nthe air bubbles out of the syringe. \n\n \n Air bubbles: \n\nIncorrect \nCorrect \n\n \n\uf0b7 Slowly push back on the plunger to leave \n\nonly the amount prescribed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Make sure the top of the plunger head \n\nlines up with the syringe marking that \nmatches your prescribed dose. If necessary \npush liquid back into the vial to achieve the \ndesired dose. \n\n \n Adjust the amount to your prescribed dose \n \n\uf0b7 Do a final check to ensure the correct \n\namount of liquid for your dose is in the \nsyringe and all air bubbles have been \nremoved. \n\n \n\n \nBefore continuing: \n \n\uf0b7 Do make sure the correct amount of liquid for your dose remains in the syringe. \n \n\uf0b7 Do make sure all air bubbles are removed from the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n 100\n\n\uf0b7 Once all air bubbles are removed and syringe \nis filled with your correct dose, twist off \nsyringe from vial adapter. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Keep filled syringe in your hand and do \n\nnot touch syringe tip. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not set filled syringe down after \n\nremoving from vial. \n\n \n \nStep 6. Prepare injection needle \n \nUsing: Filled syringe with measured Nplate dose and safety needle. \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Holding the syringe in the palm of your hand \n\nwith the tip facing up, remove the safety \nneedle from the package. \n\n \n\n\n\n 101\n\n\uf0b7 Attach safety needle to filled syringe. \nApply strong force while twisting to attach \nthe safety needle onto syringe. Turn \nclockwise to lock into Luer lock tip. \n\n \n\uf0b7 The product is now ready for injection. \n\nIMMEDIATELY continue to step 7. \n\n \n \nStep 7. Choose and prepare an injection site \n \nUsing: New alcohol swab. \n \nDo the following: \n \n Injection Site \n\uf0b7 Select your injection site. Three \n\nrecommended injection sites for Nplate \ninclude: \n-  Front of the middle thighs \n\n \n-  Abdomen, except for the 5 centimetre \n\narea right around the navel \n \n\n-  If someone else is giving you the \ninjection, they can also use the outer \narea of the upper arms \n\n \n-  Do rotate the site for each injection.\n\n \n\n Front Back \n \n\uf0b7 Do not inject into areas where the skin is \n\ntender, bruised and hard. \n \n\uf0b7 Do not inject into areas with scars or stretch \n\nmarks. \n \n\uf0b7 Wipe the site where Nplate is to be injected \n\nwith an alcohol swab, using a circular \nmotion. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do not touch this area again before giving \n\nthe injection. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 102\n\nStep 8. Injecting the Nplate liquid \n \nUsing: Filled syringe and needle assembly. \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Pull back on the pink safety cover \n\n(toward the syringe and away from the \nneedle). \n\n \n\n \n\uf0b7 Remove clear needle shield by holding \n\nsyringe in one hand and carefully pulling \nshield straight off with the other hand. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do remove the clear needle shield before \n\ninjecting. \n\n \n\uf0b7 With one hand, gently pinch the cleaned \n\narea of skin and hold it firmly. With the \nother hand, hold the syringe (like a \npencil) at a 45-degree angle to the skin. \n\n \n\uf0b7 With a short, sharp motion, push the \n\nneedle into the skin. \n\n \n\n\n\n 103\n\n\uf0b7 Inject the prescribed dose subcutaneously \nas directed by your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist. \n\n \n\uf0b7 When the syringe is empty, pull the needle \n\nout of the skin, being careful to keep it at \nthe same angle as inserted. \n\n \n\uf0b7 There may be a little bleeding at the \n\ninjection site. You can press a cotton ball \nor gauze over the injection site for \n10 seconds. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Do not rub the injection site. If needed, \n\nyou may cover the injection site with a \nplaster. \n\n \n\n \n\uf0b7 After injecting, use your thumb (or tip of \n\nyour finger) to activate the pink safety \ncover by pushing the cover forward using \nthe same hand until you hear and/or feel it \nclick and lock into place over the needle. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Visually confirm that the needle tip is \n\ncovered. Always cover the needle with the \npink safety cover before disposal. \n\n \n \nStep 9. Disposing of supplies \n \nDo the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Immediately discard syringe with covered needle into a sharps container. \n\uf0b7 Immediately discard used Nplate vial into an appropriate waste container. \n\uf0b7 Make sure all other materials are discarded into proper containers. \n \n\n\n\n 104\n\nThe injection device and Nplate vial must NEVER be reused. \n\uf0b7 Do dispose of the used needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant container. \n\uf0b7 Do dispose of any left-over Nplate in proper waste container. Left over Nplate in the vial must \n\nNEVER be re-used for another injection. \n \n \n\n\n\n 105\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 106\n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for romiplostim, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n \nA signal was triggered by a positive test of binding and neutralising antibodies to thrombopoietin \n(TPO) in a paediatric clinical trial. The review of the MAH\u2019s clinical trial database identified \n2 subjects with binding and neutralising antibodies to TPO (one paediatric and one adult); 10 subjects \nwith binding and neutralising antibodies to romiplostim and binding antibodies to TMP (3 adults and \n7 paediatrics); 2 subjects with binding and neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. In addition, the \nfollowing subjects were identified from the MAH\u2019s global safety database, 2 subjects with binding and \nneutralising antibodies to romiplostim and 4 subjects with binding and / or neutralising antibodies to \nromiplostim and binding antibodies to TPO. \n \nIn view of the current new data, an update of the current product information is warranted in order to \nreflect the known information on immunogenicity. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for romiplostim the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing romiplostim is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

(e. coli). warnings and precautions if you stop taking nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. if you stop taking nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with you. if you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. the risk of blood clotting may also be increased if you: - have liver problems; - are elderly (\u2265 65 years); - are bedridden; - have cancer; - are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; - have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; - are obese (overweight); - are a smoker. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using nplate. if you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. your doctor will adjust your dose of nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. bone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) long-term use of nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. these changes may lead to abnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. the mild form of these bone marrow changes is called \"increased reticulin\" and has been observed in nplate clinical trials. it is not known if this may progress to a more severe form called \"fibrosis.\" signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormalities in your blood tests. your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you should have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking nplate. worsening of blood cancers your doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you have itp, and not another condition such as myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). if you have mds and receive nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your mds condition may worsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. loss of response to romiplostim if you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing increased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim's activity. children and adolescents nplate is not recommended for use in children aged under 1 year. other medicines and nplate tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. if you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy) there is a greater risk of bleeding. your doctor will discuss this with you. if you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat your itp, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with nplate. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or

your doctor, who will closely control the amount of nplate given to you. nplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). your initial dose is 1 microgram of nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. your doctor will tell you how much you must take. nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep your platelet counts up. your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. once your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. your dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. children (1 to 17 years old): in addition to adjusting your dose based on platelet counts, your doctor will also regularly reassess your body weight in order to adjust your dose. if you use more nplate than you should your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of nplate. if you have been given more nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts may rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. therefore if your doctor suspects that you have been given more nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. if you use less nplate than you should your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of nplate. if you have been given less nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts may become low and this may increase the risk of bleeding. therefore if your doctor suspects that you have been given less nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. if you forget to use nplate if you have missed a dose of nplate, your doctor will discuss with you when you should have your next dose. if you stop using nplate if you stop using nplate, your low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
