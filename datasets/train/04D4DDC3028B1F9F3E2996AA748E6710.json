NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nAblavar 0.25 mmol/ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \n1 ml Ablavar solution for injection contains 244 mg (0.25 mmol) gadofosveset trisodium equivalent to \n227 mg gadofosveset. \n \n \nEach vial of 10 ml solution contains a total of 2.44 g (2.50 mmol) of gadofosveset trisodium \nequivalent to 2.27 g of gadofosveset \nEach vial of 15 ml solution contains a total of 3.66 g (3.75 mmol) of gadofosveset trisodium \nequivalent to 3.41g of gadofosveset. \nEach vial of 20 ml solution contains a total of 4.88 g (5.00 mmol) of gadofosveset trisodium \nequivalent to 4.54g of gadofosveset. \n \n \nExcipient \nThis medicinal product contains 6.3 mmol sodium (or 145 mg) per dose. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nSolution for injection. \nClear, colourless to pale yellow liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \nAblavar is indicated for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for \nvisualisation of abdominal or limb vessels in adults only, with suspected or known vascular disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nThis medicinal product should only be used by physicians experienced in the field of diagnostic \nimaging. \n \nPosology \nAdults: 0.12 ml/kg body weight (equivalent to 0.03 mmol/kg) \n \nImaging time points \nDynamic imaging begins immediately upon injection. Steady state imaging can begin after the \ndynamic scan has been completed. In clinical trials, imaging was completed up to approximately one \nhour following injection. \n \nNo clinical information is available about repeated use of this medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (aged 65 years and above) \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nUse of Ablavar should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period unless the \ndiagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) (see section 4.4). If use of Ablavar cannot be avoided, the dose should not exceed \n0.03 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack \nof information on repeated administration, Ablavar injections should not be repeated unless the \ninterval between injections is at least 7 days. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose adjustments in hepatic impairment are not necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \nUse is not recommended in neonates, infants, children and adolescents. No clinical experience is yet \navailable for patients younger than 18. \n \nMethod of administration \nThis medicinal product should be administered as a single intravenous bolus injection, manually, or by \nmagnetic resonance injector (MR injector) over a period of time up to 30 seconds followed by a 25-\n30 ml normal saline flush.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n  \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nDiagnostic procedures involving the use of MRI contrast agents should be carried out under the \nsupervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to \nbe performed. Appropriate facilities should be available for coping with any complication of the \nprocedure, as well as for emergency treatment of potential severe reactions to the contrast agent itself.  \nThe usual safety precautions for magnetic resonance imaging must be observed, e.g., exclusion of \ncardiac pacemakers and ferromagnetic implants. \nAs with other contrast enhanced diagnostic procedures, post-procedure observation of the patient is \nrecommended, in particular in patients with a history of allergy, renal insufficiency, or adverse \nreaction. \n \nHypersensitivity warning \nThe possibility of a reaction, including serious, life-threatening, fatal, anaphylactoid, or cardiovascular \nreactions, or other idiosyncratic reactions should always be considered especially in those patients \nwith a known clinical hypersensitivity, previous reaction of contrast media, a history of asthma, or \nother allergic disorders. Experience with other contrast media shows that the risk of hypersensitivity \nreactions is higher in those patients. Delayed reactions may occur (after hours to days).  \n \nCaution should also be exercised in the following cases: \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur (see section 4.8), administration of the contrast medium must be \ndiscontinued immediately and - if necessary - specific therapy instituted via a venous access. It is \ntherefore advisable to use a flexible indwelling cannula for intravenous contrast medium \nadministration. Due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions after intravenous contrast \nadministration, preparedness for institution of emergency measures is necessary, e.g., appropriate \nmedicinal products, an endotracheal tube, and a respirator should be at hand. \n \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nRenal impairment \nSince gadofosveset is cleared from the body primarily by urinary excretion, caution should be \nexercised in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nPrior to administration of Ablavar, it is recommended that all patients are screened for renal \ndysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests. \n \nThere have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some \ngadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the \nincidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. As there is a possibility that NSF may occur with \nAblavar, it should therefore be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients in the \nperioperative liver transplantation period unless the diagnostic information is essential and not \navailable with non-contrast enhanced MRI. \n \nHaemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration may be useful at removing Ablavar from the body. \nThere is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in \npatients not already undergoing haemodialysis. \n \nElderly \nAs the renal clearance of gadofosveset may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to \nscreen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction. \n \nHaemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration in patients currently receiving haemodialysis may \nbe useful at removing Ablavar from the body. In a clinical trial it was shown that gadofosveset can \neffectively be removed from the body by dialysis using high flux filters. \n \nThere is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in \npatients not already undergoing haemodialysis.  \n \nElectrocardiographic changes \nElevated levels of gadofosveset (e.g. repeated use in the short term [within 6-8 hours], or an \ninadvertent overdose > 0.05 mmol/kg) may be associated with mild QT prolongation (8.5 msec by \nFridericia correction). In the situation of elevated levels of gadofosveset or underlying QT \nprolongation the patient should be carefully observed including cardiac monitoring. \n \nVascular stents \nIt has been shown in published studies that MRA in the presence of metallic stents causes artefacts. \nThe reliability of lumen visualisation in a stented vessel with Ablavar has not been evaluated.   \n \nSodium \nThis medicine contains 6.3 mmol sodium (or 145 mg) per dose. \nTo be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nBecause gadofosveset is bound to albumin, an interaction with other plasma protein bound active \nsubstances (e.g., ibuprofen and warfarin) is generally possible, i.e., a competition for the protein \nbinding site can occur. However, in a series of in vitro drug interaction studies (in 4.5 % human serum \nalbumin and human plasma), gadofosveset demonstrated no adverse interaction with digitoxin, \npropranolol, verapamil, warfarin, phenprocoumon, ibuprofen, diazepam, ketoprofen, naproxen, \ndiclofenac and piroxicam at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro studies using human liver \nmicrosomes did not indicate any potential to inhibit the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system. \n \nIn a clinical study, it was shown that gadofosveset does not affect the unbound fraction of warfarin in \nplasma. The anticoagulant activity of warfarin was not altered and the efficacy of the medicinal \nproduct was not influenced. \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \nLaboratory test interactions \nIn clinical trials using Ablavar, no specific trends were observed that would signify a potential \ninteraction of the medicinal product with laboratory test methods. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of Ablavar in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown \nreproductive toxicity at repeated high doses (see section 5.3). Ablavar should not be used during \npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use of the medicinal product. \n \nBreast-feeding \nGadolinium containing contrast agents are excreted into breast milk in very small amounts (see section \n5.3). At clinical doses, no effects on the infant are anticipated due to the small amount excreted in milk \nand poor absorption from the gut. Continuing breastfeeding or discontinuing Ablavar for a period of \n24 hours after administration should be at the discretion of the physician and breast-feeding mother. \n \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed. Uncommonly, \ndizziness or vision problems may occur with this medicine. If a patient experiences these effects \nhe/she should not drive or use machines \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were pruritus, paresthesia, headache, nausea, vasodilatation, \nburning sensation and dysgeusia. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.  \nMost of the adverse reactions (80%) occurred within 2 hours. Delayed reactions (after hours to days) \nmay occur. \nClinical trial data  \nBased on clinical trial experience in more than 1,800 patients, the following adverse reactions have \nbeen observed. \n \nThe table below reports adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ classes (MedDRA SOCs). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nSystem Organ \nClass (MedDRA) \n\nCommon \n(\uf0b3 1/100) \n \n\nUncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to \uf03c 1/100)  \n\nRare \n(\uf0b3 1/10,000 to \uf03c 1/1,000)  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Nasopharyngitis \n \n\nCellulitis \nUrinary tract infection \n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity \n \n\n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Hyperglycaemia \nElectrolyte imbalance (incl. \nHypocalcemia) \n \n\nHyperkalemia \nHypokalemia  \nHypernatremia \nAppetite decreased \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Anxiety \nConfusion \n \n\nHallucination \nAbnormal dreams \n \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nSystem Organ \nClass (MedDRA) \n\nCommon \n(\uf0b3 1/100) \n \n\nUncommon \n(\uf0b3 1/1,000 to \uf03c 1/100)  \n\nRare \n(\uf0b3 1/10,000 to \uf03c 1/1,000)  \n\n \n \n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache  \nParaesthesia  \nDysgeusia \nBurning sensation\n\nDizziness (excl.

However, there is no evidence that haemodialysis is \nsuitable for prevention of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Contrast media, paramagnetic contrast media, ATC code: V08CA. \n \nAblavar is a formulation of a stable gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (GdDTPA) chelate \nsubstituted with a diphenylcyclohexylphosphate group (gadofosveset trisodium), for use in magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI). \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nGadofosveset binds reversibly to human serum albumin. Protein binding enhances T1 relaxivity of \ngadofosveset up to 10 fold compared to non-protein bound gadolinium chelates. In human studies, \ngadofosveset substantially shortens blood T1 values for up to 4 hours after intravenous bolus injection. \nRelaxivity in plasma was measured to be 33.4 to 45.7 mM-1s-1 over the dose range of up to \n0.05 mmol/kg at 20 MHz. High resolution MRA scans of vascular structures are obtained up to one \nhour after administration of the medicinal product. The extended vascular imaging window for \ngadofosveset is attributed to enhanced relaxivity and extended residence in vascular space resulting \nfrom its plasma protein binding. No comparative studies with extracellular gadolinium contrast agents \nhave been conducted. \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of Ablavar in patients under 18 years of age have not been established.   \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nDistribution \nThe plasma concentration-time profile of intravenously administered gadofosveset conforms to a two-\ncompartment open model. After intravenous administration of 0.03 mmol/kg dose the mean half-life of \nthe distribution phase (t1/2\uf061) was 0.48 \u00b1 0.11 hours and the volume of distribution at steady state was \n148 \u00b1 16 ml/kg, roughly equivalent to that of extracellular fluid. Plasma protein binding was in a range \n80% to 87% for up to the first 4 hours after injection.  \n \nBiotransformation \nThe results from various evaluations of plasma and urine samples indicated that gadofosveset does not \nundergo measurable metabolism. \n \nElimination \nIn healthy volunteers, gadofosveset was predominantly eliminated in the urine with 84% (range 79 \u2013 \n94%) of the injected dose (0.03 mmol/kg) excreted in the urine in 14 days. Ninety-four percent (94%) \nof the urinary excretion occurred in the first 72 hours. A small portion of gadofosveset dose was \nrecovered in the faeces (4.7%, range 1.1 \u2013 9.3%), indicating a minor role of biliary excretion in the \ndisposition of gadofosveset. After intravenous administration of 0.03 mmol/kg dose renal clearance \n(5.51 \u00b1 0.85 ml/h/kg) and total clearance (6.57 \u00b1 0.97 ml/h/kg) were similar, and mean terminal \nelimination half-life was 18.5 \u00b1 3.0 hours. \n \nCharacteristics in patients \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with moderate to severe renal impairment the half-life is markedly prolonged and the AUC \nincreased by 2-3fold.  \n \nHemodialysis patients \nGadofosveset can be removed from the body by hemodialysis. After bolus intravenous administration \nof 0.05 mmol/kg dose in patients requiring three times a week haemodialysis using high-flux filter, at \nthe end of third dialysis session, the plasma concentration had declined to less than 15 % of the Cmax. \nDuring the dialysis sessions the mean half-life of plasma concentration decline was in the range \n5-6 hours. The mean dialysis clearance was between the range of 16-32 ml/h/kg. The high-flux \ndialysis filter was more efficient compared to the low-flux filter, therefore, use of a high-flux dialysis \nfilter is recommended. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPlasma pharmacokinetics and protein binding of gadofosveset were not significantly influenced by \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). A slight decrease in faecal elimination of gadofosveset \nwas seen for the hepatic impaired subjects (2.7%) compared to normal subjects (4.8%). In one subject \nwith moderate hepatic impairment and abnormally low serum albumin, total clearance and half-life of \ngadofosveset was indicative of faster clearance compared to subjects with moderate hepatic \nimpairment and normal serum albumin levels. \n \n\n8 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute toxicity, local tolerance, contact-sensitising potential, and genotoxicity. \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies were performed. \n \nRepeated dose toxicity \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies revealed vacuolation of the tubular cells of the kidneys, with strong \nevidence for reversibility of the effect. No functional impairment was observed and electron \nmicroscopic investigations of the rat kidneys indicated that the observed vacuolation was primarily a \nstorage phenomenon. Effects were of higher severity in rats than in monkeys, probably because of the \nhigher renal clearance in rats. In monkeys, no renal effects were observed after single use even at a \ndose 100-times higher than the clinical dose. \n \nReproduction toxicity \nIn rabbits, an increased number of early resorptions and a slight but significant increase in the number \nof foetal anomalies (in particular hydrocephalus and malrotated limbs) were observed at doses at \nwhich no or slight maternal toxicity was observed (exposure was 2 and 5 times the expected human \nexposure, respectively). In an animal study, it was shown that less than 1% of the dose of gadofosveset \nadministered enters breast milk. \n \n \n6.

FURTHER INFORMATION \n \nWhat Ablavar contains \n \n- The active substance is gadofosveset.  1 ml contains 227 mg gadofosveset equivalent to \n\n244 mg/ml (0.25 mmol/millilitre) gadofosveset trisodium.  \n 10 ml solution contains 2.27 g, 15 ml solution contains 3.41g and 20 ml solution contains 4.54 g \n\nof gadofosveset in a vial. \n \n- The other ingredients are fosveset, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, and water for injections.  \n \nWhat Ablavar looks like and contents of the pack \n \nAblavar is a clear, colourless to pale yellow liquid supplied in a rubber stoppered glass vial, with an \naluminium seal, in individual cartons. The contents of the packs are:  \n \n1, 5 or 10 injection vials with 10 ml solution for injection (in 10-ml glass vial) \n1, 5 or 10 injection vials with 15 ml solution for injection (in 20-ml glass vial) \n1, 5 or 10 injection vials with 20 ml solution for injection (in 20-ml glass vial) \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n  \nTMC Pharma Services Ltd., Finchampstead, Berkshire RG40 4LJ , UK \nTel:01252 842255 \n \n  \n\n \nThis leaflet was last approved in  \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- \nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: \n \nPrior to administration of Ablavar it is recommended that all patients are screened for renal \ndysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests. \n \nThere have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some \ngadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment \n(GFR< 30 ml/min /1.73 m2). Patients undergoing liver transplantation are at particular risk since the \n\n27 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n28 \n\nincidence of acute renal failure is high in this group. As there is a possibility that NSF may occur with \nAblavar, it should therefore be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients in the \nperioperative liver transplantation period unless the diagnostic information is essential and not \navailable with non-contrast enhanced MRI. If use of Ablavar cannot be avoided, the dose should not \nexceed 0.03 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose should not be used during a scan. Because of \nthe lack of information on repeated administration, Ablavar injections should not be repeated unless \nthe interval between injections is at least 7 days.   \n \nAs the renal clearance of gadofosveset may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly important to \nscreen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction. \n \nHaemodialysis shortly after Ablavar administration may be useful at removing Ablavar from the body. \nThere is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in \npatients not already undergoing haemodialysis. \n \nAblavar should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires use \nof gadofosveset. \n \nContinuing breast feeding or discontinuing Ablavar for a period of 24 hours after administration, \nshould be at the discretion of the doctor and lactating mother. \n \nThe peel-off tracking label included on the vials should be stuck onto the patient record to enable \naccurate recording of the gadolinium contrast agent used. The dose used should also be recorded. \n \nAblavar is supplied ready to use as a clear, colourless to pale yellow aqueous solution. \nContrast media should not be used in case of severe discolouration, the occurrence of particulate \nmatter, or defective container. \n \nVials containing Ablavar are not intended for the withdrawal of multiple doses. The rubber stopper \nshould never be pierced more than once. After withdrawal of the solution from the vial, this medicinal \nproduct should be used immediately.  \n \nAny remaining solution not used in one examination must be discarded. \n \n
