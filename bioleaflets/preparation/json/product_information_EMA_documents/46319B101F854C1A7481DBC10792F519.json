NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nJylamvo 2 mg/ml oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 2 mg methotrexate. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nOne ml of solution contains 2 mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (as the sodium salt), and 0.2 mg ethyl \nhydroxybenzoate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \nClear yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJylamvo is for use in the following indications: \n \nIn rheumatological and dermatological diseases \n \n Active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. \n Polyarthritic forms of active, severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in adolescents and \n\nchildren aged 3 years and over when the response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) has been inadequate. \n\n Severe, treatment-refractory, disabling psoriasis which does not respond sufficiently to other \nforms of treatment such as phototherapy, psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) therapy \nand retinoids, and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult patients. \n\n \nIn oncology \n\n \n Maintenance treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and \n\nchildren aged 3 years and over \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMethotrexate should only be prescribed by physicians with expertise in the use of methotrexate and a \nfull understanding of the risks of methotrexate therapy. \n\nPosology \n \nRheumatological and dermatological diseases \n \nImportant warning about the dosage of Jylamvo (methotrexate) \nIn the treatment of rheumatological or dermatological diseases, Jylamvo (methotrexate) must only be \ntaken once a week. Dosage errors in the use of Jylamvo (methotrexate) can result in serious adverse \nreactions, including death. Please read this section of the summary of product characteristics very \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\ncarefully. \n \nThe prescriber should ensure that patients or their carers will be able to comply with the once weekly \nregimen.  \n\nThe prescriber should specify the day of intake on the prescription. \n \nThe dose and duration of treatment are determined individually on the basis of the patient’s clinical \npicture and the tolerability of methotrexate. Treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, severe JIA, \nsevere psoriasis and severe psoriatic arthritis represents a long-term treatment. \n \nA weekly dose of 25 mg (12.5 ml) should not be exceeded. Doses exceeding 20 mg (10 ml)/week can \nbe associated with a substantial increase in toxicity, especially bone marrow depression. \n \nConcurrent folic acid supplementation of 5 mg twice weekly (except on the day of administration) is \nindicated additionally. \n \nDosage in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 7.5 mg (3.75 ml) methotrexate once weekly. \nDepending on the individual activity of the disease and tolerability by the patient, the dose may be \nincreased gradually by 2.5 mg (1.25 ml) per week. \n \nResponse to treatment can be expected after approximately 4-8 weeks. \nAfter the desired treatment outcome is achieved, the dose should be reduced gradually to the lowest \npossible effective maintenance dose. \nSymptoms may return after treatment discontinuation.  \n \nDosage in children and adolescents with polyarthritic forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPatients with JIA should always be referred to a rheumatology unit specialising in the treatment of \nchildren/adolescents. \n \nThe recommended dose is 10-15 mg (5-7.5 ml)/m² body surface area (BSA)/week. In \ntherapy-refractory cases the weekly dosage may be increased to 20 mg (10 ml)/m² BSA/week. \nHowever, an increased monitoring frequency is indicated if the dosage is increased. \n \nDosage in adults with severe forms of psoriasis and adult patients with psoriatic arthritis \n \nIt is recommended that a test dose of 2.5-5 mg (1.25-2.5 ml) be administered one week prior to \ninitiation of therapy, in order to detect early occurring adverse reactions. If, one week later, \nappropriate laboratory tests are normal, treatment may be initiated. The recommended initial dose is \n7.5 mg (3.75 ml) methotrexate once weekly. The dose should be increased gradually but should not, in \ngeneral, exceed a weekly dose of 25 mg of methotrexate. The usual dose is 10 mg–25 mg (5 ml–\n12.5 ml) taken once weekly. Doses exceeding 20 mg (10 ml) per week can be associated with \nsignificant increase in toxicity, especially bone marrow suppression.  \n \nResponse to treatment can generally be expected after approximately 4-8 weeks. After the desired \ntreatment outcome is achieved, the dose should be reduced gradually to the lowest possible effective \nmaintenance dose. \n \nOncology \n \nDosage in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n \nLow-dose methotrexate is used in the maintenance treatment of ALL in children aged 3 years and \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nover, adolescents and adults within complex protocols in combination with other cytostatic medicinal \nproducts. Treatment should follow current therapy protocols. \n \nCommon accepted single doses lie in the range of 20-40 mg (10-20 ml)/m² body surface area.  \n \nIf methotrexate is administered in combination with chemotherapy regimens, the dosage should take \ninto consideration any overlapping toxicity of the other medicinal product components.  \n \nHigher dosages should be given parenterally. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nMethotrexate should be used with caution in paediatric patients. Treatment should follow currently \npublished therapy protocols for children (see section 4.4). \n \nDoses are usually based on the patient’s BSA and maintenance treatment represents a long-term \ntreatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nMethotrexate should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe dose should be adjusted as follows for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, \npsoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the oncology indication recommendations in published protocols \nshould also apply. \n \n\nCreatinine clearance \n(ml/min) \n\n% of dose to be administered \n\n>60 100 \n\n30- 59  50 \n\n<30 Jylamvo must not be administered. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nMethotrexate should be administered only with the greatest caution, if at all, in patients with \nsignificant existing or previous liver disease, especially if due to alcohol. If bilirubin levels are \n>5 mg/dl (85.5 µmol/l), methotrexate is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nUse in children under 3 years of age is not recommended as insufficient data on efficacy and safety are \navailable for this patient group \n \nElderly  \nDose reduction should be considered in elderly patients (65 years and over) due to reduced liver and \nkidney function as well as low folic acid reserves which occur with increased age. In addition, close \nmonitoring of patients for possible early signs of toxicity is recommended (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 \nand 5.2). \n \nPatients with pathological fluid accumulations (pleural effusion, ascites) \nAs the half-life of methotrexate can be prolonged four-fold in patients with pathological fluid \naccumulations, it may be necessary to reduce the dose and in some cases even to discontinue \nmethotrexate (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). The amount of dose reduction should be decided on a case by \ncase basis. \n \nMethod of administration \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nJylamvo is for oral use only. \n \nThe medicinal product can be taken with or without food.  \nThe solution is provided ready for use, and it must be swallowed with some water to remove any \nmethotrexate residue from the oral cavity. \nA 10 ml oral dosing syringe is provided for accurate measurement of the prescribed dose (see Package \nLeaflet). \n \nIf the oral route is ineffective, a change to a parenteral dosage form is indicated. This can be done with \nmethotrexate as an intramuscular or subcutaneous administration and is recommended for patients \nwho exhibit inadequate absorption of the oral form of methotrexate or who do not tolerate oral \nadministration well. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n Hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels are >5 mg/dl [85.5 µmol/l], see section 4.2) \n Alcohol abuse \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min, see section 4.2) \n Pre-existing blood disorders such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or \n\nsignificant anaemia \n Immunodeficiency \n Severe, acute or chronic infections such as tuberculosis and HIV \n Stomatitis, ulcers of the oral cavity and known active gastrointestinal ulcers \n Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n Concurrent vaccination with live vaccines \n \nAdditionally for non-oncological indications \n Pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe oral solution contains 2 mg of methotrexate in each ml of solution; the scaling of the dosing \nsyringe is in ml and not mg; care should be taken that the correct dosing volume is prescribed. \nPatients with rheumatological or dermatological diseases must be informed unequivocally that \ntreatment is to be taken just once a week and not daily. Incorrect use of methotrexate can result in \nsevere and even fatal adverse reactions. Medical staff and patients must be clearly instructed. \n \nThe prescriber should specify the day of intake on the prescription. \nThe prescriber should make sure patients understand that Jylamvo (methotrexate) should only be taken \nonce a week. \nPatients should be instructed on the importance of adhering to the once-weekly intakes. \n \nPatients must be appropriately monitored during treatment so that signs of possible toxic effects or \nadverse reactions can be detected and evaluated with minimal delay. \nTherefore, methotrexate should only be administered by, or under the supervision of, doctors whose \nknowledge and experience includes treatment with antimetabolites.  \nEspecially strict monitoring of the patient is indicated following prior radiotherapy (especially of the \npelvis), functional impairment of the haematopoietic system (e.g., following prior radio- or \nchemotherapy), impaired general condition as well as advanced age and in very young children. \nBecause of the possibility of severe or even fatal toxic reactions, patients should be extensively \ninformed by the treating doctor of the risks involved (including early signs and symptoms of toxicity) \nand the recommended safety measures. Patients should be informed that they must notify the doctor \nimmediately if any symptoms of an overdose occur and that the symptoms of the overdose need to be \nmonitored (including regular laboratory tests). \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nDoses exceeding 20 mg (10 ml)/week can be associated with a substantial increase in toxicity, \nespecially bone marrow depression. \n \nBecause of the delayed excretion of methotrexate in patients with impaired kidney function, they \nshould be treated with particular caution and only with low doses of methotrexate (see section 4.2). \n \nMethotrexate should be used only with great caution, if at all, in patients who have a significant liver \ndisease, particularly if this is/was alcohol-related. \n \nFertility  \nMethotrexate has been reported to cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction \nand amenorrhoea in humans during and for a short period after the discontinuation of treatment, \naffecting spermatogenesis and oogenesis during the period of its administration - effects that appear to \nbe reversible on discontinuing therapy. \n \nTeratogenicity – Reproductive risk  \nMethotrexate causes embryotoxicity, abortion and foetal malformations in humans. Therefore, the \npossible effects on reproduction, pregnancy loss and congenital malformations should be discussed \nwith female patients of childbearing age (see section 4.6).  \nIn non-oncologic indications, the absence of pregnancy must be confirmed before Jylamvo is used. If \nwomen of a sexually mature age are treated, effective contraception must be used during treatment and \nfor at least six months after. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nRecommended examinations and safety measures \n \nBefore beginning treatment or resuming treatment after a recovery period \nComplete blood count with differential blood count and platelets, liver enzymes, bilirubin, serum \nalbumin, chest X-ray and renal function tests. If clinically indicated, tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C \nshould be excluded. \n \nDuring treatment  \nThe tests below must be conducted weekly in the first two weeks, then every two weeks for a month; \nthereafter, depending on the leucocyte count and the stability of the patient, at least once a month \nduring the next six months and then at least every three months.  \n \nAn increased monitoring frequency should be considered when the dose is increased. In particular, \nelderly patients should be monitored at short intervals for early signs of toxicity (see section 4.2). \n \n- Examination of the mouth and throat for mucosal changes. \n \n- Complete blood count with differential blood count and platelets. Methotrexate-induced \n\nhaematopoietic suppression may occur abruptly and with apparently safe dosages. Any serious \ndecrease in leucocyte or platelet counts indicates the immediate discontinuation of treatment \nand appropriate supportive therapy. Patients should be encouraged to report all signs and \nsymptoms suggestive of infection to their doctor. In patients simultaneously taking \nhaematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. leflunomide), blood count and platelets should be closely \nmonitored. \n\n  \n- Liver function tests - particular attention should be given to the appearance of liver toxicity.  \n Treatment should not be initiated or should be discontinued if there are any abnormalities in \n\nliver function tests or liver biopsies, or if these develop during therapy. Such abnormalities \nshould return to normal within two weeks, after which, treatment may be resumed at the \ndiscretion of the doctor. \n\n Testing of serum liver enzymes Transient increases in transaminases to twice or three times \nnormal occur in 13-20% of patients. Persistent abnormalities of liver enzymes and/or a decrease \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nin serum albumin can indicate severe hepatotoxicity. In rheumatological indications, there is no \nevidence to support use of liver biopsies in monitoring hepatotoxicity. For psoriasis patients the \nneed of a liver biopsy prior to and during therapy is controversial. \n\n \n Further research is needed to establish whether serial liver function tests or determinations of \n\npropeptide of type III collagen are appropriate for detecting hepatotoxicity. This evaluation \nshould differentiate between patients with no risk factors and patients with risk factors, such as \nexcessive prior alcohol consumption, persistent elevation of liver enzymes, history of liver \ndisease, family history of a hereditary liver disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and history of \nsignificant exposure to hepatotoxic medicinal product or chemicals, as well as prolonged \nmethotrexate treatment or a cumulative total dose of 1.5 g or more. \n\n \n If liver enzymes are constantly increased, a dose reduction or treatment discontinuation should \n\nbe considered. \n \n Due to its potentially toxic effects on the liver, additional hepatotoxic medicinal products should \n\nnot be taken during treatment with methotrexate unless urgently necessary and the consumption \nof alcohol should be avoided or reduced (see section 4.5). Closer monitoring of liver enzymes \nshould be undertaken in patients taking other hepatotoxic medicinal products concomitantly \n(e.g. leflunomide). This should also be considered during simultaneous administration of \nhaematotoxic medicinal products. \n\n \n Increased caution is required in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as hepatic \n\ncirrhosis has developed in individual cases without any elevation of transaminases during \nmethotrexate treatment. \n\n \n- Renal function should be monitored by renal function tests and urinalyses. If serum creatinine \n\nlevels are increased, the dose should be reduced. If creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min, \ntreatment with methotrexate should not be given (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n Treatment with moderately high and high doses of methotrexate should not be initiated at \n\nurinary pH values of less than 7.0. Alkalinisation of the urine must be tested by repeated pH \nmonitoring (value greater than or equal to 6.8) for at least the first 24 hours after the \nadministration of methotrexate is started. \n\n \n- Respiratory tract examination - patients must be monitored for symptoms of a lung function \n\ndisorder and lung function tests performed if necessary. Lung-related symptoms (particularly a \ndry, non-productive cough) or non-specific pneumonitis that occurs during treatment with \nmethotrexate can be a sign of potentially dangerous damage and require the discontinuation of \ntreatment and careful monitoring. Although the clinical presentation is variable, patients with \nmethotrexate-induced lung diseases typically suffer from fever, cough, dyspnoea or \nhypoxaemia. A chest X-ray must be taken in order to be able to exclude an infection. Acute or \nchronic interstitial pneumonia, often in association with blood eosinophilia, may occur and \ndeaths have been reported. Patients should be informed of the risks of pneumonia and advised to \ncontact their doctor immediately if they develop a persistent cough or persistent dyspnoea. \n\n \n In addition, pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage has been reported with methotrexate used in \n\nrheumatologic and related indications. This event may also be associated with vasculitis and \nother comorbidities. Prompt investigations should be considered when pulmonary alveolar \nhaemorrhage is suspected to confirm the diagnosis. \n\n \n Methotrexate should be discontinued in patients with pulmonary symptoms and an immediate \n\nexamination (including chest X-ray) should be performed to exclude infection and tumours. If \nmethotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, treatment with corticosteroids should be \ninitiated and treatment with methotrexate should not be restarted. \n\n \n Pulmonary symptoms require a rapid diagnosis and discontinuation of methotrexate therapy. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nMethotrexate-induced lung diseases such as pneumonitis can occur acutely and at any time \nduring treatment, are not always completely reversible and have already been observed at all \ndoses (including low doses of 7.5 mg (3.75 ml)/week). \n\n \n Opportunistic infections can occur during treatment with methotrexate, including Pneumocystis \n\njiroveci pneumonia, which can also have a fatal outcome. If a patient develops pulmonary \nsymptoms, the possibility of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be considered. \n\n \n Particular caution is required in patients with impaired pulmonary function.  \n \n Particular caution is also required in the presence of inactive chronic infections (e.g. herpes \n\nzoster, tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C) as it is possible that activation of these infections may \noccur. \n\n \nRenal impairment and patients at risk of renal impairment \nAs methotrexate is eliminated mainly via the kidneys, increased concentrations are to be expected in \nthe presence of renal impairment, which may result in severe adverse reactions. \nIf there is the possibility of renal impairment (e.g. in elderly subjects), monitoring should take place at \nshorter intervals. This applies in particular when medicinal products that affect the elimination of \nmethotrexate, or that cause kidney damage (e.g. NSAIDs) or that can potentially lead to impairment of \nhaematopoiesis, are administered concomitantly. \nIf risk factors such as renal function disorders, including mild renal impairment, are present, combined \nadministration with NSAIDs is not recommended. Dehydration may also intensify the toxicity of \nmethotrexate. \n(See renal function monitoring) \n \nImmune system \nDue to its effect on the immune system, methotrexate may impair the response to vaccinations and \naffect the results of immunological tests. Concurrent vaccination using live vaccines should not be \ngiven. \n \nMalignant lymphomas  \nMalignant lymphomas may occur in patients receiving low dose methotrexate, in which case therapy \nmust be discontinued. If the lymphomas fail to regress spontaneously, cytotoxic treatment must be \ninitiated. \n \nPleural effusions or ascites \nPleural effusions and ascites should be drained prior to initiation of methotrexate treatment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nConditions that cause dehydration such as vomiting, diarrhoea or stomatitis \nConditions that cause dehydration such as vomiting, diarrhoea or stomatitis can increase toxicity as a \nresult of raised active substance levels. In this case, treatment with methotrexate must be discontinued \nuntil the symptoms have disappeared. \n \nIt is important to determine any increase in active substance levels within 48 hours of therapy, \notherwise irreversible methotrexate toxicity may occur. \n \nDiarrhoea and ulcerative stomatitis may be signs of toxic effects and require the discontinuation of \ntreatment, otherwise haemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur. \nFollowing the occurrence of haematemesis, black-coloured stools or blood in the stools, treatment \nmust be discontinued. \n \nFolic acid supplementation \nIf acute methotrexate toxicity occurs, patients may require treatment with folinic acid. In patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, folic acid or folinic acid supplementation may reduce methotrexate \ntoxicity, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, stomatitis, alopecia and elevated liver enzymes. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \nIt is recommended to check levels of vitamin B12 prior to initiating folic acid supplementation, \nparticularly in adults aged over 50 years, as folic acid intake may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. \n \nVitamin products \nVitamin preparations or other products containing folic acid, folinic acid or their derivatives may \ndecrease the effectiveness of methotrexate (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nDermatitis and sunburn \nRadiation-induced dermatitis and sunburn can reappear during methotrexate therapy (recall reactions). \nPsoriatic lesions can worsen during UV radiation and co-administration of methotrexate. \n \nSkin toxicity \nSevere, occasionally fatal, dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell’s \nsyndrome) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported after single or multiple doses of \nmethotrexate. \n \nEncephalopathy/leukoencephalopathy \nSince cases of encephalopathy/leukoencephalopathy have occurred in cancer patients treated with \nmethotrexate, this cannot be ruled out either for patients with non-cancer indications. \n \nExcipient warnings \nThis medicinal product contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and ethyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E214). It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe risk of an interaction between NSAIDs and methotrexate should be considered in patients with a \nlow methotrexate dose, particularly in the case of impaired kidney function. If combined treatment is \nrequired, the blood count and renal function should be monitored. Caution should be exercised if \nNSAIDs and methotrexate are administered within 24 hours, since in this case methotrexate plasma \nlevels can rise and toxicity be increased as a result. Animal studies showed that the administration of \nNSAIDs including salicylic acid resulted in reduced tubular methotrexate secretion and accordingly \npotentiated its toxic effects. However, in clinical trials in which NSAIDs and salicylic acid were \nadministered adjuvantly to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no increase in adverse reactions was \nobserved. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with such medicinal products can be continued during \ntherapy with low-dose methotrexate, but only under close medical supervision. \n \nPatients taking potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products during treatment with methotrexate (e.g. \nleflunomide, azathioprine, sulfasalazine and retinoids) should be monitored closely for increased \nhepatotoxicity. The consumption of alcohol should be avoided during treatment with methotrexate \n(see section 4.4). Regular alcohol consumption and administration of additional hepatotoxic medicinal \nproducts increase the likelihood of hepatotoxic adverse reactions to methotrexate. \nAdministration of additional haematotoxic medicinal products (e.g. metamizole) increases the \nlikelihood of severe haematotoxic adverse reactions to methotrexate. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions between methotrexate, anticonvulsants (reduced serum methotrexate \nlevels) and 5-fluoruracil (increased half-life of 5-fluoruracil) must be borne in mind. \n \nSalicylates, phenylbutazone, diphenylhydantoin (= phenytoin), barbiturates, tranquillisers, oral \ncontraceptives, tetracyclines, amidopyrine derivatives, sulphonamides, thiazide diuretics, oral \nhypoglycaemics, doxorubicin and p-aminobenzoic acid displace methotrexate from serum albumin \nbinding and thus increase bioavailability and hence toxicity (indirect dose increase). \n \nProbenecid and weak organic acids can also reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate and thus \nlikewise cause an indirect increase in dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nAntibiotics such as penicillins, glycopeptides, sulphonamides, ciprofloxacin and cefalotin can in \nindividual cases reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate, so that increased serum methotrexate \nconcentrations can occur, accompanied by haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity. \nOral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and non-absorbable broad-spectrum antibiotics \nmay reduce intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by \ninhibiting intestinal flora or suppressing bacterial metabolism. \n \nIn the event of (prior) treatment with medicinal products that can have adverse reactions on bone \nmarrow (e.g. sulphonamides, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, pyrimethamine), the \npossibility of haematopoietic disorders must be considered. \n \nConcomitant therapy with medicinal products that can cause folic acid deficiency (e.g. sulphonamides, \ntrimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole) can result in increased methotrexate toxicity. Accordingly, \nparticular caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing folic acid deficiency. \n \nConversely, co-administration of medicinal products containing folinic acid or vitamin preparations \ncontaining folic acid or derivatives may impair the efficacy of methotrexate. \n \nThe combination of methotrexate and sulfasalazine can enhance the effect of methotrexate, as \nsulfasalazine causes inhibition of folic acid synthesis. This can result in an increased risk of adverse \nreactions, although in several studies this was only observed in individual patients. \n \nCiclosporin may potentiate methotrexate efficacy and toxicity. There is a risk of excessive \nimmunosuppression with risk of lymphoproliferation when the combination is used. \n\n \nThe use of nitrous oxide potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate metabolism, yielding \nincreased toxicity such as severe, unpredictable myelosuppression and stomatitis and in case of \nintrathecal administration increased severe, unpredictable neurotoxicity. Whilst this effect can be \nreduced by administering calcium folinate, the concomitant use of nitrous oxide and methotrexate \nshould be avoided. \n \nCo-administration of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole or pantoprazole can result in \ninteractions: co-administration of methotrexate and omeprazole has resulted in delayed renal \nelimination of methotrexate. In one case in which methotrexate was combined with pantoprazole, \nrenal elimination of the metabolite 7-hydroxymethotrexate was inhibited and myalgia and shivering \noccurred. \n \nThe application of procarbazine during high-dose methotrexate therapy increases the risk of \nimpairment or renal function \n \nExcessive consumption of caffeine- or theophylline-containing beverages (coffee, caffeinated \nbeverages, black tea) should be avoided during methotrexate therapy as the effect of methotrexate may \nbe reduced by the possible interaction between methotrexate and methylxanthines at the adenosine \nreceptors. \n \nCombination therapy with methotrexate and leflunomide may increase the risk for pancytopenia.  \n \nParticularly in the case of orthopaedic surgery where the risk of infection is high, combination therapy \nwith methotrexate and immunomodulatory medicinal products must be used with caution. \n \nCholestyramine can increase the non-renal elimination of methotrexate by interfering with the \nenterohepatic circulation. \n \nThe possibility of delayed methotrexate clearance should be considered in combination with other \ncytostatic medicinal products. \n \nRadiotherapy during the use of methotrexate can increase the risk for soft tissue or bone necrosis. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \nMethotrexate can reduce the clearance of theophylline. During concomitant therapy with \nmethotrexate, therefore, serum theophylline levels should be monitored. \n \nCombined administration of mercaptopurine and methotrexate can increase the bioavailability of \nmercaptopurine, possibly as a result of inhibition of the metabolism of mercaptopurine. \n \nIn view of its possible effects on the immune system, methotrexate can falsify vaccinal and test results \n(immunological procedures to assess the immune reaction). During methotrexate therapy, concurrent \nvaccination with live vaccines should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \nWomen must not get pregnant during methotrexate therapy, and effective contraception must be used \nduring treatment with methotrexate and at least 6 months thereafter (see section 4.4). Prior to initiating \ntherapy, women of childbearing potential must be informed of the risk of malformations associated \nwith methotrexate and any existing pregnancy must be excluded with certainty by taking appropriate \nmeasures, e.g. a pregnancy test. During treatment pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically \nrequired (e.g. after any gap of contraception). Female patients of reproductive potential must be \ncounselled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nContraception in males \nIt is not known if methotrexate is present in semen. Methotrexate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies, such that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to low-dose methotrexate (less than 30 mg [15 ml]/week). For higher \ndoses, there is insufficient data to estimate the risks of malformations or miscarriage following \npaternal exposure. \n \nAs precautionary measures, sexually active male patients or their female partners are recommended to \nuse reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and for at least 6 months after cessation \nof methotrexate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 6 months following \ndiscontinuation of methotrexate. \n \nPregnancy \nMethotrexate is contraindicated during pregnancy in non-oncological indications (see section 4.3). If \npregnancy occurs during treatment with methotrexate and up to six months thereafter, medical advice \nshould be given regarding the risk of harmful effects on the child associated with treatment and \nultrasonography examinations should be performed to confirm normal foetal development. In animal \nstudies, methotrexate has shown reproductive toxicity, especially during the first trimester (see section \n5.3). Methotrexate has been shown to be teratogenic to humans; it has been reported to cause foetal \ndeath, miscarriages and/or congenital abnormalities (e.g. craniofacial, cardiovascular, central nervous \nsystem and extremity-related).  \n \nMethotrexate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, \nintrauterine growth restriction and congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy. \n  \n Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 42.5% of pregnant women exposed to low-dose \n\nmethotrexate treatment (less than 30 mg [15 ml]/week), compared to a reported rate of 22.5% in \ndisease-matched patients treated with drugs other than methotrexate. \n\n \n Major birth defects occurred in 6.6% of live births in women exposed to low-dose methotrexate \n\ntreatment (less than 30 mg [15 ml]/week) during pregnancy, compared to approximately 4% of live \nbirths in disease-matched patients treated with drugs other than methotrexate. \n\n \nInsufficient data is available for methotrexate exposure during pregnancy higher than \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n30 mg (15 ml)/week, but higher rates of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations are \nexpected, in particular at doses commonly used in oncologic indications  \n \nWhen methotrexate was discontinued prior to conception, normal pregnancies have been reported.  \n \nWhen used in oncological indications, methotrexate should not be administered during pregnancy in \nparticular during the first trimester of pregnancy. In each individual case the benefit of treatment must \nbe weighed up against the possible risk to the foetus. If the drug is used during pregnancy or if the \npatient becomes pregnant while taking methotrexate the patient should be informed of the potential \nrisk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAs methotrexate passes into breast milk and may cause toxicity in breast-fed children, treatment is \ncontraindicated during the lactation period (see section 4.3). If use during the lactation period should \nbecome necessary, breast-feeding is to be stopped prior to treatment. \n \nFertility \nMethotrexate affects spermatogenesis and oogenesis and may decrease fertility. In humans, \nmethotrexate has been reported to cause oligospermia, menstrual dysfunction and amenorrhoea. These \neffects appear to be reversible after discontinuation of therapy in most cases. In oncologic indications, \nwomen who are planning to become pregnant are advised to consult a genetic counselling centre, if \npossible, prior to therapy and men should seek advice about the possibility of sperm preservation \nbefore starting therapy as methotrexate can be genotoxic at higher doses (see section 4.4). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMethotrexate has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines, since central nervous \nsystem disorders such as tiredness, dizzy spells or drowsiness can occur during treatment.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn general, the incidence and severity of side effects are considered to be dose-related. \n \nIn the antineoplastic treatment, myelosuppression and mucositis are the predominant dose-limiting \ntoxic effects of methotrexate. The severity of these reactions depends on the dose, mode and duration \nof application of methotrexate. Mucositis generally appears about 3 to 7 days after methotrexate \napplication, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia follow a few days later. In patients with unimpaired \nelimination mechanisms, myelosuppression and mucositis are generally reversible within 14 to 28 \ndays. \n \nMost serious adverse reactions of methotrexate include bone marrow suppression, pulmonary toxicity, \nhepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, thromboembolic events, anaphylactic shock and Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome.  \n \nMost frequently (very common) observed adverse reactions of methotrexate include gastrointestinal \ndisorders (e.g. stomatitis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite) and abnormal liver \nfunction tests (e.g. increased alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), \nbilirubin, alkaline phosphatase). Other frequently (common) occurring adverse reactions are \nleukopenia, anaemia, thrombopenia, headache, tiredness, drowsiness, pneumonia, interstitial \nalveolitis/pneumonitis often associated with eosinophilia, oral ulcers, diarrhoea, exanthema, erythema \nand pruritus. \n \nThe occurrence and severity of adverse reactions depend on dosage level and frequency of \nadministration of methotrexate. However, as severe adverse reactions may occur even at low doses, it \nis essential for the treating physician to monitor patients closely (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nMost adverse reactions are reversible if they are detected early. If such adverse reactions occur, the \ndose should either be reduced or treatment discontinued and appropriate countermeasures taken (see \nsection 4.9). Methotrexate therapy should only be resumed with particular caution, after careful \nconsideration of the need for treatment and with increased vigilance for the possible recurrence of \ntoxicity. \n

indications  \n4 see remarks on liver biopsy in section 4.4 \n \nPaediatric population \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and adolescents are expected to be the \nsame as in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms of overdose \nThe symptoms following oral overdose predominantly affect the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal \nsystems. \nSymptoms include leucocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, \nmyelosuppression, mucositis, stomatitis, oral ulceration, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulceration \nand bleeding. \nCases of overdose have been reported, sometimes fatal, due to erroneous daily intake instead of \nweekly intake of oral methotrexate. In these cases, symptoms that have been commonly reported are \nhematological and gastrointestinal reactions. \n \nThere are reports of deaths from sepsis, septic shock, renal failure and aplastic anaemia. \n \nTherapeutic management of overdose \nCalcium folinate is the specific antidote for neutralising the adverse toxic effects of methotrexate. In \nthe event of accidental overdose, a dose of calcium folinate equal to or higher than the offending dose \nof methotrexate should be administered intravenously or intramuscularly within 1 hour, and dosing \ncontinued until serum level of methotrexate are below 10-7 mol/L. \n \nIn the event of a massive overdose, hydration and alkalinisation of the urine may be required to \nprevent precipitation of methotrexate and/or its metabolites in the renal tubules. Neither haemodialysis \nnor peritoneal dialysis has been shown to improve the elimination of methotrexate. Effective clearance \nof methotrexate is reported to be achieved with acute intermittent haemodialysis using a high-flux \ndialyser. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antimetabolites, folic acid \nanalogues, ATC code: L01BA01 \n \nMechanism of action \nMethotrexate is a folic acid antagonist that, as an antimetabolite, belongs to the class of cytotoxic \nactive substances. It acts by competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and thus \ninhibits DNA synthesis. \n \nIt has not yet been possible to date to clarify whether the efficacy of methotrexate in the management \nof psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and chronic polyarthritis is due either to an anti-inflammatory or \nimmunosuppressive effect, or to what extent a methotrexate-induced increase in extracellular \nadenosine concentration at inflamed sites contributes to this effect. \n \nHighly proliferating tissue such as malignant cells, bone marrow, foetal cells, skin epithelium and \nmucosa is generally more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. Cell proliferation is usually greater \nin malignant tumours than in normal tissue and methotrexate can therefore exert a sustained effect on \nmalignant growth without causing irreversible damage to normal tissue. \n \nIn psoriasis, cell proliferation of the epithelium is markedly increased compared with normal skin. \nThis difference in cell proliferation rate is the starting point for the use of methotrexate in particularly \nsevere, generalised, treatment-resistant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration, methotrexate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When administered \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nin low doses (7.5 mg/m2 to 80 mg/m2 body surface area), the mean bioavailability of methotrexate is \napproximately 70%, but considerable inter- and intra-individual variations are possible (25-100%). \nPeak serum concentrations are attained within 1-2 hours. \n \nData from a randomised trial in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (aged 2.8 to 15.1 years) \nindicated greater oral bioavailability of methotrexate in the fasting state. In children with JIA, the dose \nnormalized area under the plasma concentration versus time-curve (AUC) of methotrexate increased \nwith the age of the children and was lower than that found in adults. The dose normalized AUC of the \nmetabolite 7-hydroxymethotrexate was not dependent on age. \n \nDistribution \nMethotrexate is approximately 50% bound to serum proteins. After distribution, it collects \npredominantly in the liver, kidneys and spleen in the form of polyglutamates, which can be retained \nfor weeks or months. \n \nThe mean terminal half-life is 6-7 hours and demonstrates considerable variations (3-17 hours). The \nhalf-life may be prolonged up to four-fold in patients with a third distribution compartment (pleural \neffusion, ascites). \n \nBiotransformation \nApproximately 10% of the administered methotrexate dose is metabolised in the liver. The main \nmetabolite is 7-hydroxymethotrexate. \n \nElimination \nExcretion occurs predominantly in the unchanged form by glomerular filtration and active secretion in \nthe proximal tubule via the kidneys. \nApproximately 5-20% of methotrexate and 1-5% of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is eliminated in the bile. \nThere is a pronounced enterohepatic circulation. \n \nElimination in patients with impaired renal function is markedly delayed. Impaired elimination in \npatients with hepatic impairment is not known at present. \n \nMethotrexate crosses the placental barrier in rats and monkeys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nChronic toxicity \nIn chronic toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs, toxic effects were seen in the form of gastrointestinal \nlesions, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. \n \nMutagenic and carcinogenic potential \nLong-term studies in rats, mice and hamsters revealed no evidence of a tumorigenic potential of \nmethotrexate. Methotrexate induces gene and chromosomal mutations in vitro and in vivo. There is a \nsuspected mutagenic effect in humans. \n \nReproductive toxicology \nTeratogenic effects have been observed in four species (rats, mice, rabbits, cats). In rhesus monkeys, \nno malformations comparable to those seen in humans occurred. \n \n \n6.

To \ndecrease the risk of exposure, parents and care givers should wear disposable gloves when handling \nmethotrexate. \nContact with the skin or mucous membrane must be avoided. If methotrexate comes into contact with \nskin or mucosa, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. \n \nSpillages must be wiped immediately. \n \nWomen who are pregnant, planning to be or breast-feeding should not handle methotrexate. \n \nParents, care givers and patients should be advised to keep methotrexate out of the reach of children, \npreferably in a locked cupboard.  \n \nAccidental ingestion can be lethal for children. \n \nKeep the bottle tightly closed to protect the integrity of the product and minimise the risk of accidental \nspillage. \nThe usual caution should be exercised in handling cytostatics. \n \nInstructions for use of the syringe provided in the pack  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n1.  Put on disposable gloves before handling. \n2.  Shake the bottle. \n3.  Remove the bottle cap and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle. \n4.  Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor. \n5.  Turn the bottle upside down. \n6.  Pull the syringe plunger back SLOWLY so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the \n\nsyringe until the WIDEST part of the white syringe plunger is lined up to the black syringe \nmarking of the dose required.  DO NOT measure to the narrow tip of the plunger.  If there are \nair bubbles in the syringe, repeat until bubbles are eliminated. \n\n7. Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, \nholding the syringe by the barrel rather than the plunger. \n\n8.  Confirm that the dose in the syringe is correct. \n9.  Ensure that the patient is sitting up or standing before giving the medicine. \n10 Gently place the tip of the syringe into the patient’s mouth and direct it to the inside of the \n\ncheek. \n11. Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of the \n\ncheek. DO NOT push down the plunger too hard or squirt the medicine to the back of the mouth \nor throat as this may cause choking. The plunger should be pushed back gently to the seated \nposition until it clicks into place. \n\n12. Remove the syringe from the patient’s mouth. \n13.  Ask the patient to swallow the medicine and then to drink some water, making sure no medicine \n\nis left in the mouth. \n14.  Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. \n15. Wash the syringe immediately after use with fresh warm, soapy water and rinse well. The \n\nsyringe should be held under water and the plunger drawn in and out several times until all \ntraces of medicine are removed from inside the syringe including the tip. The plunger and barrel \nshould then be separated and both washed thoroughly in the warm soapy water. They should \nthen be rinsed thoroughly under COLD water and excess water shaken off before wiping dry \nwith a clean paper towel. The plunger and barrel should be stored in a clean dry container with \nthe medicine and reassembled before next use. All parts of the syringe should be completely dry \nbefore using it for the next dose. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements for cytotoxic products. \n \n \n7.

What Jylamvo is and what it is used for \n \nJylamvo is a medicine that: \n- suppresses the growth of certain cells in the body that multiply rapidly (an anticancer medicine) \n- reduces unwanted reactions by the body's own defense mechanisms (an immunosuppressive \n\nagent) \n- has an anti-inflammatory effect \n \nJylamvo is used in patients with: \n- the following rheumatic and skin diseases: \n\no active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults \no polyarthritic forms (when five or more joints are affected) of active, severe juvenile \n\nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) in adolescents and children aged 3 years and over when the \nresponse to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inadequate \n\no severe, treatment-resistant, disabling psoriasis that does not respond sufficiently to \nother forms of treatment such as phototherapy, psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation \n(PUVA) therapy and retinoids, as well as in severe psoriasis that also affects the joints \n(psoriatic arthritis) in adult patients \n\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and children aged 3 years and over  \n \nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Jylamvo \n \nDo not take Jylamvo \n- if you are allergic to methotrexate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have a severe kidney impairment (or your doctor classes the impairment as severe) \n- if you have a liver impairment  \n- if you have blood disorders such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or \n\nsignificant anaemia  \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n- if you drink alcohol excessively \n- if you have a weakened immune system \n- if you are suffering from a serious infection such as tuberculosis or HIV \n- if you have ulcers in the stomach or in the intestines  \n- if you have an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth or mouth ulcers \n- if you are breast-feeding and additionally, for non-oncologic indications (for non-cancer \n\ntreatment) if you are pregnant (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”) \n- if you have had a live vaccine recently or are about to have one \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\nImportant warning about the dose of Jylamvo (methotrexate): \nThis oral solution contains 2 mg methotrexate in 1 ml solution and the scaling of the dosing \nsyringe is in ml and not mg. \nTake Jylamvo only once a week for the treatment of rheumatic or skin diseases (RA, JIA and \npsoriasis or psoriatic arthritis). \nTaking too much of Jylamvo (methotrexate) may be fatal.  \nPlease read section 3 of this leaflet very carefully. \nIf you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take this medicine. \n\n \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jylamvo: \n- if you have diabetes mellitus treated with insulin \n- if you are suffering from inactive, chronic infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, \n\nshingles [herpes zoster]) as they may flare up \n- if you have ever had any liver or kidney disease \n- if you have problems with your lung function \n- if you are particularly overweight \n- if you have an abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) or around the lungs (pleural \n\neffusions) \n- if you are dried out (dehydrated) or suffer from conditions that result in dehydration (vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea, constipation, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth) \n \nIf you had skin problems after radiotherapy (radiation dermatitis) or sunburn, these reactions can recur \nafter methotrexate therapy (recall reaction). \n \nEnlarged lymph nodes (lymphoma) may occur in patients receiving low dose methotrexate and if this \nis the case, therapy must be stopped. \n \nAcute bleeding from the lungs in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease has been reported \nwith methotrexate. If you experience symptoms of spitting or coughing up blood you should contact \nyour doctor immediately. \n \nDiarrhoea can be a possible side effect of Jylamvo and requires an interruption of therapy. If you \nsuffer from diarrhoea please speak to your doctor. \n \nCertain brain disorders (encephalopathy/leukoencephalopathy) have been reported in cancer patients \nreceiving methotrexate. Such side effects cannot be excluded when methotrexate is used to treat other \ndiseases. \n \nPsoriasis skin changes can become worse during treatment with methotrexate if you are under UV \nlight. \n \nMethotrexate temporarily affects sperm and egg production. Methotrexate can cause miscarriage and \nsevere birth defects. You and your partner should avoid having a baby if you are being given \nmethotrexate at the time and for at least 6 months after the end of your treatment with methotrexate. \nSee also section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \nRecommended follow-up examinations and precautions \nSevere side effects can occur even when methotrexate is used at low doses. Your doctor must carry out \ninvestigations and laboratory tests in order to detect these effects as early as possible. \n \nBefore the beginning of treatment \nYour doctor should perform blood tests before the beginning of treatment to check how well your \nkidneys and liver are working. You will possibly also have an X-ray of your chest. Other tests may \npossibly be performed before and after treatment. Do not miss your blood test appointments. \n \nIf the results of any test are abnormal, the treatment will not be restarted until all the values have \nreturned to normal. \n \nChildren, adolescents and elderly \nChildren, adolescents and the elderly treated with methotrexate should have particularly careful \nmedical monitoring in order to detect important side effects quickly. \n \nThis medicine is not recommended in children under 3 years of age as there is insufficient experience \nin this age group \n \nOther medicines and Jylamvo \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal or natural medicinal \nproducts. \nRemember to inform your doctor about the treatment with Jylamvo if you are prescribed another \nmedicine during treatment. \n \nIt is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n- other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, such as leflunomide, azathioprine (also \n\nused to prevent rejection after an organ transplant), sulfasalazine (also used for ulcerative \ncolitis)  \n\n-         ciclosporin (for supressing the immune system) \n-  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or salicylates (medicines against pain and/or \n\ninflammation such as acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac and ibuprofen or pyrazole) \n- live vaccines \n-         diuretics, that reduce fluid retention  \n-         medicines for lowering blood sugar levels such as metformin \n- retinoids (for the treatment of psoriasis and other skin diseases) \n- antiepileptic medicines (prevention of seizures) \n- barbiturates (sleeping medicines) \n- sedatives \n- oral contraceptives \n- probenecid (for gout) \n- antibiotics \n- pyrimethamine (for the prevention and treatment of malaria) \n- vitamin preparations containing folic acid \n- proton pump inhibitors (for the treatment of heartburn, ulcers and some other stomach \n\ncomplaints) \n- theophylline (for breathing problems) \n- mercaptopurine (for the treatment of certain types of leukaemia). \n-  cancer treatments ( such as doxorubicin and procarbazine during high-dose methotrexate \n\ntherapy) \n \nJylamvo with food, drink and alcohol \nThis medicine can be taken with or without food. When you have taken your dose, drink some water \nand swallow it to ensure you have taken your full dose and there is no methotrexate left in your mouth. \nYou should not drink alcohol during treatment with Jylamvo and should avoid drinking excessive \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\namounts of coffee, caffeinated drinks and black leaf tea. Ensure that you drink a lot of fluids during \ntreatment with Jylamvo because dehydration (the reduction of body water) can increase the side effects \nof methotrexate.  \n \nPregnancy \nDo not use Jylamvo during pregnancy except if your doctor has prescribed it for oncology treatment. \nMethotrexate can cause birth defects, harm the unborn child or cause miscarriage. It is associated with \nmalformations of the skull, face, heart and blood vessels, brain, and limbs.  It is therefore very \nimportant that methotrexate is not given to pregnant women or to women who are planning to become \npregnant unless used for oncology treatment.  \n \nFor non-oncological indications, in women of child-bearing age the possibility of a pregnancy must be \nruled out, e.g. by pregnancy tests, before treatment is started. \n \nDo not use Jylamvo if you are trying to become pregnant. You must avoid becoming pregnant during \ntreatment with methotrexate and for at least 6 months after the end of treatment. Therefore you must \nensure that you are taking effective contraception for the whole of this period (see also section \n\"Warnings and precautions\"). \n \nIf you become pregnant during treatment or suspect you might be pregnant, speak to your doctor as \nsoon as possible. If you do become pregnant during treatment, you should be offered advice regarding \nthe risk of harmful effects on the child through treatment. \n \nIf you want to become pregnant, you should speak with your doctor, who may refer you for specialist \nadvice before the planned start of treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment as methotrexate passes into the breast milk. If your doctor \nconsiders that continuing treatment with methotrexate is essential, you must stop breast-feeding. \n \nMale Fertility \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father \ntakes methotrexate less than 30 mg (15 ml)/week. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded and \nthere is no information regarding higher methotrexate doses.  Methotrexate can have a genotoxic \neffect. This means that the medicine can cause genetic mutations. Methotrexate can affect the \nproduction of sperm, which is associated with the possibility of birth defects. \n \nYou should avoid fathering a child or to donate semen during treatment with methotrexate and for at \nleast 6 months after the end of treatment. As treatment with methotrexate at higher doses commonly \nused in cancer treatment can cause infertility and genetic mutations, it may be advisable for male \npatients treated with methotrexate doses higher than 30 mg (15 ml)/week to consider sperm \npreservation before the beginning of treatment (see also section \"Warnings and precautions\"). \n \nDriving and using machines \n \n    !          Caution: This medicine can affect your capacity to react and your ability to drive. \n \nSide effects affecting the central nervous system such as tiredness or dizziness can occur during \ntreatment with Jylamvo. In some cases the ability to drive or use machines may be affected. If you feel \ntired or dizzy, you should not drive a vehicle or use machines.   \n \nJylamvo contains ethyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate \nEthyl parahydroxybenzoate (E214) and sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) may cause \nallergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n \n3. How to take Jylamvo \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nJylamvo should be prescribed only by doctors who are familiar with the properties of the medicine and \nhow it works. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nTaking Jylamvo incorrectly can result in severe side effects and even death. \n \nThe duration of the treatment is determined by the treating physician. Treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis, severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis, severe psoriasis and severe psoriatic arthritis with Jylamvo \nis a long-term treatment. \n \nRecommended dose \nYour doctor will decide what dose of Jylamvo you should take according to the condition you are \nbeing treated for, how severe it is and your general health. Keep to the dose exactly and follow your \ndoctor’s instructions exactly on when to take the medicine. \n \nDose in rheumatic and skin diseases (RA, JIA and psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis) \nTake Jylamvo only once a week. Decide with your doctor the most suitable day of the week to take \nthe medicine. \n \nDosage in adult rheumatoid arthritis:  \nThe usual initial dose is 7.5 mg (3.75 ml), once a week. \n \nDosage for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis:  \nThe usual initial dose is 7.5 mg (3.75 ml), once a week.  \n \nThe doctor may increase the dose if the used dose is not effective but tolerated well.  \nYour doctor may adjust the dose to suit you according to your response to treatment and side effects. \n \nDose in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you should take for your condition and when you should take the \ndose. Keep to this dose exactly. \n \nUse in children and adolescents  \nThe doctor will calculate the dose required from the child’s body surface area (m2), and the dose is  \nexpressed as mg/m2.  \n \nElderly \nBecause of the reduced liver and kidney function and the lower folate reserves in elderly patients, a \nrelatively low dosage should be chosen for them. \n \nHow to take the medicine  \nYour pack of Jylamvo contains a bottle of medicine with a cap, a bottle adaptor and a white dosing \nsyringe. Always use the syringe provided to take your medicine. \n \nIf you are a parent or caregiver giving the medicine, wash your hands before and after giving a dose. \nWipe up spillages immediately. For protection, you should wear disposable gloves when handling \nJylamvo. \n \nWomen who are pregnant, planning to be or breast-feeding should not handle methotrexate. \n \nIf Jylamvo comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, you should wash the affected area with water \nand soap. \n \nJylamvo is for oral use and provided ready for use.  \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \nPlease note that this oral solution contains 2 mg methotrexate in 1 ml solution and that the \nscaling of the dosing syringe is in ml and not mg. \n \nMethotrexate can be taken with or without food. When you have taken your dose, drink some water \nand swallow it to ensure you have taken your full dose and there is no methotrexate left in your mouth. \n \nWhen you use the medicine follow the instructions below: \n \n1.  Put on disposable gloves before handling. \n2.  Shake the bottle. \n3.  Remove the bottle cap and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle. \n4.  Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor. \n5.  Turn the bottle upside down. \n6.  Pull the syringe plunger back SLOWLY so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the \n\nsyringe until the WIDEST part of the white syringe plunger is lined up to the black syringe \nmarking of the dose required.  DO NOT measure to the narrow tip of the plunger.  If there are \nair bubbles in the syringe, repeat until bubbles are eliminated. \n\n7. Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, \nholding the syringe by the barrel rather than the plunger. \n\n8.  Confirm that the dose in the syringe is correct. \n9.  Ensure that the patient is sitting up or standing before giving the medicine. \n10 Gently place the tip of the syringe into the patient’s mouth and direct it to the inside of the \n\ncheek. \n11. Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of the \n\ncheek. DO NOT push down the plunger too hard or squirt the medicine to the back of the mouth \nor throat as this may cause choking. The plunger should be pushed back gently to the seated \nposition until it clicks into place. \n\n12. Remove the syringe from the patient’s mouth. \n13.  Ask the patient to swallow the medicine and then to drink some water, making sure no medicine \n\nis left in the mouth. \n14.  Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. \n15. Wash the syringe immediately after use with fresh warm, ‘soapy’ water and rinse well. The \n\nsyringe should be held under water and the plunger drawn in and out several times until all \ntraces of medicine are removed from inside the syringe including the tip. The plunger and barrel \nshould then be separated and both washed thoroughly in the warm soapy water. They should \nthen be rinsed thoroughly under COLD water and excess water shaken off before wiping dry \nwith a clean paper towel. The plunger and barrel should be stored in a clean dry container with \nthe medicine and reassembled before next use. All parts of the syringe should be completely dry \nbefore using it for the next dose. \n\n  \nRepeat the above instructions for each dose, as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you take more Jylamvo than you should \nFollow your doctor's dose recommendations. Never change the dose on your own. \n \nIf you suspect that you (or someone else) have (has) taken too much Jylamvo, tell your doctor \nimmediately or contact the nearest hospital casualty department. The doctor will decide whether any \ntreatment is needed. \n \nAn overdose of methotrexate can cause serious reactions. The symptoms of an overdose can include \nbleeding, an unusual feeling of weakness, ulcers in the mouth, feeling sick, vomiting, black or bloody \nstools, coughing up blood or vomiting blood with a coffee grounds appearance and a reduced urine. \nSee also section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n \nTake the medicine pack with you when you visit your doctor or the hospital. \nThe antidote in the event of an overdose is calcium folinate. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \nIf you forget to take Jylamvo  \nNever take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose but continue with the prescribed dose. Ask \nyour doctor for advice. \n \nIf you stop taking Jylamvo \nDo not interrupt or stop the treatment with Jylamvo without first discussing this with your doctor. If \nyou suspect you have a severe side effect, talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

\nMethotrexate can reduce the number of white blood cells and therefore weaken your immune defences. \nIf you notice any symptoms of an infection such as fever or a marked worsening in your general state of \nhealth or fever with local signs of an infection such as sore throat/inflammation of the throat or mouth or \nproblems passing water, see your doctor immediately. A blood test will be done to check for reduction in \nthe white blood cells (agranulocytosis). It is important to tell your doctor about all the medicines you take. \n \nMethotrexate can cause serious (sometimes life-threatening) side effects. Your doctor will therefore do tests \nto check for any changes in your blood (such as a low white blood cell count, a low blood platelet count, \nlymphomas), kidneys or liver. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. \n \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Jylamvo \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children, preferably in a locked cupboard. Accidental \ningestion can be lethal for children. \n \nDo not use the medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after ‘Exp’.

The PRAC concluded that an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse \nreaction “skin exfoliation / dermatitis exfoliative” with a frequency “not known” was warranted for all \nmethotrexate containing products. The PL should be amended accordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on paraesthesia / hypoaesthesia (not restricted to extremities) from \nspontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and a positive re-\nchallenge, and existing product information the PRAC considers a causal relationship between \nmethotrexate and paraesthesia / hypoaesthesia (not restricted to extremities) is at least a reasonable \npossibility. The PRAC concluded that an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add or amend the \nadverse reaction “paraesthesia / hypoaesthesia” not restricted to the extremities with a frequency of \n“very rare” was warranted for low dose methotrexate-containing products. The PL should be amended \naccordingly. \n\nIn view of available data on oedema from spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close \ntemporal relationship, and a positive de-challenge the PRAC considers a causal relationship between \nmethotrexate and oedema is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that an update of \nsection 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction “oedema” with a frequency “not known” was \nwarranted for low dose methotrexate-containing products. The PL should be amended accordingly. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for methotrexate the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing methotrexate is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
