This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMaviret 100 mg/40 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg glecaprevir and 40 mg pibrentasvir. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 7.48 mg lactose (as lactose monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPink, oblong, biconvex, film-coated tablet of dimensions 18.8 mm x 10.0 mm, debossed on one side \nwith ‘NXT’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMaviret is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and in \nadolescents aged 12 to <18 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4. and 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMaviret treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with HCV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 to <18 years \nThe recommended dose of Maviret is 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg tablets), taken orally, once \ndaily at the same time with food (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Maviret treatment durations for HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infected patients \nwith compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) are provided in Table 1 and Table 2. \n \nTable 1: Recommended Maviret treatment duration for patients without prior HCV therapy \n\nGenotype \nRecommended treatment duration  \n\nNo cirrhosis Cirrhosis \n\nGT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 8 weeks 8 weeks \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTable 2: Recommended Maviret treatment duration for patients who failed prior therapy with \npeg-IFN + ribavirin +/- sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir + ribavirin \n\nGenotype Recommended treatment duration \n\nNo cirrhosis Cirrhosis \n\nGT 1, 2, 4-6 8 weeks 12 weeks \n\nGT 3 16 weeks 16 weeks \n \nFor patients who failed prior therapy with an NS3/4A- and/or an NS5A-inhibitor, see section 4.4. \n \nMissed dose \nIn case a dose of Maviret is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 18 hours after the time it \nwas supposed to be taken. If more than 18 hours have passed since Maviret is usually taken, the \nmissed dose should not be taken and the patient should take the next dose per the usual dosing \nschedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.  \n \nIf vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing, an additional dose of Maviret should be taken. If \nvomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, an additional dose of Maviret is not needed. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with any degree of renal impairment including \npatients on dialysis (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). \nMaviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh-B) and is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and \n5.2). \n \nLiver or kidney transplant patients  \nA 12-week treatment duration has been evaluated and is recommended in liver or kidney transplant \nrecipients with or without cirrhosis (see section 5.1). A 16-week treatment duration should be \nconsidered in genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment experienced with peg-IFN + ribavirin +/- \nsofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir + ribavirin.  \n \nPatients with HIV-1 Co-infection \nFollow the dosing recommendations in Tables 1 and 2. For dosing recommendations with HIV \nantiviral agents, refer to section 4.5.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years (see sections 5.1 and \n5.2). The safety and efficacy of Maviret in children aged less than 12 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow tablets whole with food and not to chew, crush or break the \ntablets as it may alter the bioavailability of the agents (see section 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant use with atazanavir containing products, atorvastatin, simvastatin, dabigatran etexilate, \nethinyl oestradiol-containing products, strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) \n(see section 4.5).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatitis B Virus reactivation  \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should, \ntherefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nMaviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and \n5.2).  \n \nPatients who failed a prior regimen containing an NS5A- and/or an NS3/4A-inhibitor \n \nGenotype 1-infected (and a very limited number of genotype 4-infected) patients with prior failure on \nregimens that may confer resistance to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were studied in the MAGELLAN-1 \nstudy (section 5.1). The risk of failure was, as expected, highest for those exposed to both classes. A \nresistance algorithm predictive of the risk for failure by baseline resistance has not been established. \nAccumulating double class resistance was a general finding for patients who failed re-treatment with \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir in MAGELLAN-1. No re-treatment data is available for patients infected with \ngenotypes 2, 3, 5 or 6. Maviret is not recommended for the re-treatment of patients with prior exposure \nto NS3/4A- and/or NS5A-inhibitors.  \n \nDrug-drug interactions \n \nCo-administration is not recommended with several medicinal products as detailed in section 4.5. \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated.  \n \nLactose \n \nMaviret contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential for Maviret to affect other medicinal products  \n \nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3. Co-administration with Maviret \nmay increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g. dabigatran \netexilate, digoxin), BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin), or OATP1B1/3 (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, \nrosuvastatin, simvastatin). See Table 3 for specific recommendations on interactions with sensitive \nsubstrates of P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/3. For other P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1/3 substrates, dose \nadjustment may be needed. \n \nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir are weak inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and uridine \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 in vivo. Clinically significant increases in exposure were not \nobserved for sensitive substrates of CYP3A (midazolam, felodipine) or UGT1A1 (raltegravir) when \nadministered with Maviret. \n \nBoth glecaprevir and pibrentasvir inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro. \n \nSignificant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, \nUGT2B7, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K are not expected. \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Maviret, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Maviret \n \nUse with strong P-gp/CYP3A inducers  \nMedicinal products that are strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. \nJohn’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) could significantly \ndecrease glecaprevir or pibrentasvir plasma concentrations and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect \nof Maviret or loss of virologic response. Co-administration of such medicinal products with Maviret is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of Maviret with medicinal products that are moderate inducers P-gp/CYP3A may \ndecrease glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (e.g. oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, \nlumacaftor, crizotinib). Co-administration of moderate inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir are substrates of the efflux transporters P-gp and/or BCRP. Glecaprevir is \nalso a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/3. Co-administration of Maviret with \nmedicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP (e.g. ciclosporin, cobicistat, dronedarone, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, ritonavir) may slow elimination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir and thereby increase \nplasma exposure of the antivirals. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B1/3 (e.g. elvitegravir, \nciclosporin, darunavir, lopinavir) increase systemic concentrations of glecaprevir. \n \nEstablished and other potential medicinal product interactions  \n \nTable 3 provides the least-squares mean Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of \nMaviret and some common concomitant medicinal products. The direction of the arrow indicates the \ndirection of the change in exposures (Cmax, AUC, and Cmin) in glecaprevir, pibrentasvir, and the co-\nadministered medicinal product (↑ = increase (more than 25%), ↓ = decrease (more than 20%), ↔ = \nno change (equal to or less than 20% decrease or 25% increase)).

Maternal toxicity associated with embryo-foetal loss has been \nobserved in the rabbit with glecaprevir which precluded evaluation of glecaprevir at clinical exposures \nin this species (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, Maviret use is not recommended in \npregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether glecaprevir or pibrentasvir are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in milk (for \ndetails see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Maviret therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of glecaprevir and/or pibrentasvir on fertility are available. Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of glecaprevir or pibrentasvir on fertility at exposures higher \nthan the exposures in humans at the recommended dose (see Section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMaviret has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety assessment of Maviret in subjects treated for 8, 12 or 16 weeks with compensated liver \ndisease (with or without cirrhosis) was based on registrational Phase 2 and 3 studies which evaluated \napproximately 2,300 subjects. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were \nheadache and fatigue. Less than 0.1% of subjects treated with Maviret had serious adverse reactions \n(transient ischaemic attack). The proportion of subjects treated with Maviret who permanently \ndiscontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.1%. The type and severity of adverse reactions \nin subjects with cirrhosis were overall comparable to those seen in subjects without cirrhosis. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions were identified in patients treated with Maviret. The adverse reactions \nare listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nTable 4: Adverse reactions identified with Maviret  \n\nFrequency Adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nUncommon angioedema \nNervous system disorders \nVery common headache  \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon diarrhoea, nausea  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \nNot known pruritus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common fatigue  \nCommon asthenia \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment including subjects on dialysis \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe safety of Maviret in subjects with chronic kidney disease (including subjects on dialysis) and \ngenotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 chronic HCV infection with compensated liver disease (with or without \ncirrhosis) was assessed in EXPEDITION-4 (n=104) and EXPEDITION-5 (n=101).  The most common \nadverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment were pruritus (17%) and fatigue (12%) in \nEXPEDITION-4 and pruritus (14.9%) in EXPEDITION-5. \n \nAdverse Reactions in Subjects with Liver or Kidney Transplant \nThe safety of Maviret was assessed in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant recipients with genotypes 1, \n2, 3, 4, or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis (MAGELLAN-2). The overall safety profile in \ntransplant recipients was comparable to that observed in subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. Adverse \nreactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving Maviret for 12 weeks were \nheadache (17%), fatigue (16%), nausea (8%) and pruritus (7%). \n \nSafety in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infected Subjects  \nThe overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects (ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-\n2) was comparable to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety of Maviret in HCV GT1-6 infected adolescents is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-\nlabel study in 47 subjects aged 12 years to <18 years treated with Maviret for 8 to 16 weeks (DORA-\nPart 1). The adverse reactions observed were comparable with those observed in clinical studies of \nMaviret in adults. \n \nSerum bilirubin elevations \nElevations in total bilirubin of at least 2x upper limit normal (ULN) were observed in 1.3% of subjects \nrelated to glecaprevir-mediated inhibition of bilirubin transporters and metabolism. Bilirubin \nelevations were asymptomatic, transient, and typically occurred early during treatment. Bilirubin \nelevations were predominantly indirect and not associated with ALT elevations. Direct \nhyperbilirubinemia was reported in 0.3% of subjects.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented doses administered to healthy volunteers is 1,200 mg once daily for 7 days \nfor glecaprevir and 600 mg once daily for 10 days for pibrentasvir. Asymptomatic serum ALT \nelevations (>5x ULN) were observed in 1 out of 70 healthy subjects following multiple doses of \nglecaprevir (700 mg or 800 mg) once daily for ≥ 7 days. In case of overdose, the patient should be \nmonitored for any signs and symptoms of toxicities (see section 4.8). Appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment should be instituted immediately. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are not significantly removed \nby haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code:  J05AP57 glecaprevir and pibrentasvir \n \nMechanism of action \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nMaviret is a fixed-dose combination of two pan-genotypic, direct-acting antiviral agents, glecaprevir \n(NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (NS5A inhibitor), targeting multiple steps in the HCV \nviral lifecycle. \n  \nGlecaprevir \nGlecaprevir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for the \nproteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, \nNS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication.  \n \nPibrentasvir \nPibrentasvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication \nand virion assembly. The mechanism of action of pibrentasvir has been characterized based on cell \nculture antiviral activity and drug resistance mapping studies. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nThe EC50 values of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding \nNS3 or NS5A from laboratory strains are presented in Table 5.  \n \nTable 5.

Substitutions at amino acid position 168 in NS3 \nhad no impact in genotype 2, while some substitutions at position 168 reduced glecaprevir \nsusceptibility by up to 55-fold (genotypes 1, 3, 4), or reduced susceptibility by > 100-fold (genotype \n6). Some substitutions at position 156 reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir (genotypes 1 to 4) by \n> 100-fold.  Substitutions at amino acid position 80 did not reduce susceptibility to glecaprevir except \nfor Q80R in genotype 3a, which reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir by 21-fold.   \n \nSingle substitutions important for the NS5A inhibitor class at positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in \nNS5A in genotypes 1 to 6 had no impact on the activity of pibrentasvir. Specifically in genotype 3a, \nA30K or Y93H had no impact on pibrentasvir activity. Some combinations of substitutions in \ngenotypes 1a and 3a (including A30K+Y93H in genotype 3a) showed reductions in susceptibility to \npibrentasvir. In genotype 3b replicon, the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms K30 and \nM31 in NS5A reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir by 24-fold relative to the activity of pibrentasvir \nin genotype 3a replicon. \n \nIn clinical studies \n \nStudies in treatment-naïve and peginterferon (pegIFN), ribavirin (RBV) and/or sofosbuvir treatment-\nexperienced subjects with or without cirrhosis \nTwenty two of the approximately 2,300 subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in \nregistrational Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies experienced virologic failure (2 with genotype 1, 2 with \ngenotype 2, 18 with genotype 3 infection).  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAmong the 2 genotype 1-infected subjects who experienced virologic failure, one had treatment-\nemergent substitutions A156V in NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and one had Q30R/H58D \n(while Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.  \n \nAmong the 2 genotype 2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed in NS3 \nor NS5A (the M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both \nsubjects). \n \nAmong the 18 genotype 3-infected subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks who \nexperienced virologic failure, treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, or \nQ168L/R were observed in 11 subjects. A166S or Q168R were present at baseline and post-treatment \nin 5 subjects. Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were \nobserved in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n=9) or Y93H (n=5) at baseline and post-\ntreatment. \n \nStudies in subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis who were treatment-experienced to NS3/4A \nprotease and/or NS5A inhibitors  \nTen of 113 subjects treated with Maviret in the MAGELLAN-1 study for 12 or 16 weeks experienced \nvirologic failure.  \n \nAmong the 10 genotype 1-infected subjects with virologic failure, treatment-emergent NS3 \nsubstitutions V36A/M, R155K/T, A156G/T/V, or D168A/T were observed in 7 subjects. Five of the \n10 had combinations of V36M, Y56H, R155K/T, or D168A/E in NS3 at baseline and post-treatment. \nAll of the genotype 1-infected virologic failure subjects had one or more NS5A substitutions \nL/M28M/T/V, Q30E/G/H/K/L/R, L31M, P32 deletion, H58C/D, or Y93H at baseline, with additional \ntreatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28A/G, P29Q/R, Q30K, H58D, or Y93H observed in 7 of \nthe subjects at the time of failure.   \n \nEffect of baseline HCV amino acid polymorphisms on treatment response \nA pooled analysis of treatment-naïve and pegylated interferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir treatment-\nexperienced subjects receiving Maviret in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies was conducted to \nexplore the association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome and to describe \nsubstitutions seen upon virologic failure. Baseline polymorphisms relative to a subtype-specific \nreference sequence at amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and \n93 in NS5A were evaluated at a 15% detection threshold by next-generation sequencing. Baseline \npolymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), \n41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, \nrespectively. Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), \n22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, \n2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, respectively. \n \nGenotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6: Baseline polymorphisms in genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 had no impact on \ntreatment outcome.   \n \nGenotype 3: For subjects who received the recommended regimen (n=313), baseline polymorphisms \nin NS5A (Y93H included) or NS3 did not have a relevant impact on treatment outcomes. All subjects \n(15/15) with Y93H and 77% (17/22) with A30K in NS5A at baseline achieved SVR12. The overall \nprevalence of A30K and Y93H at baseline was 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively. The ability to assess the \nimpact of baseline polymorphisms in NS5A was limited among treatment-naïve subjects with cirrhosis \nand treatment-experienced subjects due to low prevalence of A30K (3.0%, 4/132) or Y93H (3.8%, \n5/132).  \n \nCross-resistance \n \nIn vitro data indicate that the majority of the resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A at amino acid \npositions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 that confer resistance to ombitasvir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, \nelbasvir, or velpatasvir remained susceptible to pibrentasvir. Some combinations of NS5A \n\n\n\n15 \n\nsubstitutions at these positions showed reductions in susceptibility to pibrentasvir. Glecaprevir was \nfully active against resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A, while pibrentasvir was fully active \nagainst resistance-associated substitutions in NS3. Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were fully active \nagainst substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B nucleotide and non-nucleotide inhibitors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTable 7 summarizes clinical studies conducted with Maviret in subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, \n5 or 6 infection.  \n \nTable 7: Clinical studies conducted with Maviret in subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 \nInfection \n\nGenotype (GT) Clinical study  Summary of study design  \nTN and PRS-TE subjects without cirrhosis \n\nGT1 ENDURANCE-1\na Maviret for 8 weeks (n=351) or 12 weeks (n=352)  \n\nSURVEYOR-1  Maviret for 8 weeks (n=34) \n\nGT2 ENDURANCE-2  Maviret (n=202) or Placebo (n=100) for 12 weeks SURVEYOR-2b Maviret for 8 weeks (n=199) or 12 weeks (n=25) \n\nGT3 \nENDURANCE-3 Maviret for 8 weeks (n=157) or 12 weeks (n=233)  Sofosbuvir + daclatasvir for 12 weeks (n=115) \n\nSURVEYOR-2  Maviret for 8 weeks (TN only, n=29) or 12 weeks (n=76) or 16 weeks (TE only, n=22) \n\nGT4, 5, 6 \n\nENDURANCE-4 Maviret for 12 weeks (n=121) \nENDURANCE-5,6 Maviret for 8 weeks (n=75) \nSURVEYOR-1  Maviret for 12 weeks (n=32) \nSURVEYOR-2c  Maviret for 8 weeks (n=58) \n\nGT1-6 VOYAGE-1f Maviret for 8 weeks (GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 and GT3 TN) (n=356) or 16 weeks (GT3 TE only) (n=6) \nTN and PRS-TE subjects with cirrhosis \nGT1, 2, 4, 5, 6 EXPEDITION-1 Maviret for 12 weeks (n=146) \nGT3 SURVEYOR-2d Maviret for 12 weeks (TN only, n=64) or 16 weeks (TE only, n=51)  \nGT5, 6 ENDURANCE-5,6 Maviret for 12 weeks (n=9) \nGT1-6 VOYAGE-2f Maviret for 12 weeks (GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 and GT3 TN) (n=157) or 16 weeks (GT3 TE only) (n=3) \nGT1-6 EXPEDITION-8 Maviret for 8 weeks (n=343) (TN only) \nSubjects with CKD stage 3b, 4 and 5 with or without cirrhosis \nGT1-6 EXPEDITION-4 Maviret for 12 weeks (n=104) \nGT1-6 EXPEDITION-5 Maviret for 8 weeks (n=84) or 12 weeks (n=13) or 16 weeks (n=4)  \nNS5A inhibitor and/or PI-experienced subjects with or without cirrhosis \nGT1, 4 MAGELLAN-1e  Maviret for 12 weeks (n=66) or 16 weeks (n=47) \nHCV/HIV-1 Co-Infected Subjects with or without Cirrhosis \nGT1-6 EXPEDITION-2 Maviret for 8 weeks (n=137) or 12 weeks (n=16) \nLiver or Kidney Transplant Recipients \nGT1-6 MAGELLAN-2 Maviret for 12 weeks (n=100)  \nAdolescent subjects (12 to <18 years) \nGT1-6 DORA (Part 1) Maviret for 8 weeks (n=44) or 16 weeks (n=3)  \n\nTN=treatment naïve, PRS-TE=treatment experienced (includes previous treatment that included pegIFN (or \nIFN), and/or RBV and/or sofosbuvir), PI=Protease Inhibitor, CKD=chronic kidney disease \na.

Studies VOYAGE-1 and \nVOYAGE-2 were conducted in China, Singapore, and South Korea in HCV genotype 1-6 subjects \nwithout cirrhosis (VOYAGE-1) or with compensated cirrhosis (VOYAGE-2) that were treatment-\nnaïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, peg-interferon, ribavirin and/or \nsofosbuvir (TE-PRS). All subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis received 8 or 12 \nweeks of Maviret, respectively, except GT3 TE-PRS subjects who received 16 weeks of Maviret. The \noverall SVR12 rates were 97.2% (352/362) and 99.4% (159/160) in VOYAGE-1 and VOYAGE-2, \nrespectively. \n \nAmong GT3b subjects without cirrhosis, a numerically lower SVR12 rate of 58.3% (7/12) [62.5% \n(5/8) for TN subjects and 50% (2/4) for TE-PRS subjects] was observed compared to GT3a subjects \nwithout cirrhosis (92.9% (13/14)). Three GT3b TN subjects experienced relapse and two GT3b TE-\nPRS subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure. Among subjects with compensated cirrhosis, \nthe overall SVR12 rate for GT3b infected subjects was 87.5% (7/8) [85.7% (6/7) for TN subjects and \n100% (1/1) for TE-PRS subjects] and 100% (6/6) for GT3a infected subjects. One GT3b TN subject \nexperienced relapse. \n \nOverall SVR12 Rate from the Clinical Studies in Treatment-Naïve or Treatment-Experienced Subjects \nwith or without Cirrhosis \nIn subjects who are treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, \npeginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir (TE-PRS) who received the recommended duration, 97.5% \n(1,395/1,431) achieved SVR12 overall, while  0.2% (3/1,431) experienced on-treatment virologic \nfailure and 0.9% (12/1,407) experienced post-treatment relapse. \n \nIn TN or TE-PRS subjects with compensated cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, \n97.1%  (431/444) achieved SVR12 (among which 97.7% [335/343] of TN subjects achieved SVR12), \nwhile 0.2% (1/444) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.9% (4/434) experienced post-\ntreatment relapse. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn TN subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration of 8 weeks, 97.5% \n(749/768) achieved SVR12, while 0.1% (1/768) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.7% \n(5/755) experienced post-treatment relapse. \n \nIn TE-PRS subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, 98.2% (215/219) \nachieved SVR12, while 0.5% (1/219) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 1.4% (3/218) \nexperienced post-treatment relapse. \n \nThe presence of HIV-1 coinfection did not impact efficacy. The SVR12 rate in TN or TE-PRS \nHCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects treated for 8 or 12 weeks (without cirrhosis and with compensated \ncirrhosis, respectively) was 98.2% (165/168) from ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2. One \nsubject experienced on-treatment virologic failure (0.6%, 1/168) and no subjects relapsed (0%, 0/166).  \n \nClinical Study in Liver or Kidney Transplant Recipients  \nMAGELLAN-2 was a single-arm, open-label study in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant HCV \nGT1-6 infected subjects without cirrhosis who received Maviret for 12 weeks. The study included \nsubjects who were HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) interferon, \nribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir, with the exception of GT3-infected subjects who were all treatment-\nnaïve.   \n \nOf the 100 subjects treated, the median age was 60 years (range: 39 to 78); 57% had HCV genotype 1, \n13% had HCV genotype 2, 24% had HCV genotype 3, 4% had HCV genotype 4, 2% had HCV \ngenotype 6; 75% were male; 8% were Black; 66% were HCV treatment-naïve; none had cirrhosis and \n80% had a baseline fibrosis state of F0 or F1; 80% of subjects were post-liver transplant and 20% were \npost-kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants allowed for co-administration were ciclosporin \n≤100 mg/day, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, prednisone, and \nprednisolone.  \n \nThe overall SVR12 rate in post-transplant subjects was 98.0% (98/100). There was one relapse and no \non-treatment virologic failure. \n \nClinical Study in Renally Impaired Subjects \nEXPEDITION-5 was an open-label study in 101 HCV GT1-6 infected subjects without cirrhosis or \nwith compensated cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b, 4, or 5. Subjects were either \ntreatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) interferon, ribavirin, and/or \nsofosbuvir and received Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks per approved treatment durations. \n \nOf the 101 subjects treated, the median age was 58 years (range 32-87); 53% had HCV genotype 1; \n27% had HCV genotype 2; 15% had HCV genotype 3; 4% had HCV genotype 4; 59% were male; \n73% were White; 80% were HCV treatment-naïve; 13% had cirrhosis and 65% had a baseline fibrosis \nstate of F0 or F1; 7% were CKD stage 3b; 17% were CKD Stage 4, and 76% were CKD Stage 5 (all \nreceiving dialysis); 84 subjects received 8 weeks of treatment, 13 subjects received 12 weeks of \ntreatment, and 4 subjects received 16 weeks of treatment. \n \nThe overall SVR12 rate was 97% (98/101).  There were no virologic failures. \n \nElderly  \nClinical studies of Maviret included 328 patients aged 65 and over (13.8% of the total number of \nsubjects). The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar to that of patients \n< 65 years of age, across treatment groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nDORA (Part 1) was an open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy in adolescents aged 12 years to \nless than 18 years who received Maviret 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg film-coated tablets), for \n8, or 16 weeks. 47 subjects were enrolled in DORA (Part 1). The median age was 14 years (range: 12 \nto 17); 79% had HCV genotype 1, 6% had HCV genotype 2, 9% had HCV genotype 3, 6% had HCV \ngenotype 4; 55% were female; 11% were Black; 77% were HCV treatment-naïve; 23% were \n\n\n\n20 \n\ntreatment-experienced to interferon; 4% had HIV-coinfection; none had cirrhosis; the mean weight \nwas 59 kg (range: 32 to 109 kg). \n \nThe overall SVR12 rate was 100% (47/47). No subject experienced virologic failure. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population from 3 years to less than \n12 years in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of the components of Maviret are provided in Table 11.  \n \nTable 11: Pharmacokinetic properties of the components of Maviret in healthy adult subjects \n\n Glecaprevir Pibrentasvir \nAbsorption \nTmax (h)a 5.0 5.0 \nEffect of meal (relative to fasting)b ↑ 83-163%  ↑ 40-53%  \nDistribution \n% Bound to human plasma proteins  97.5 >99.9 \nBlood-to-plasma ratio  0.57 0.62 \nBiotransformation \nMetabolism secondary none \nElimination \nMajor route of elimination  Biliary excretion Biliary excretion \nt1/2 (h) at steady-state 6 - 9 23 - 29 \n% of dose excreted in urinec 0.7 0 \n% of dose excreted in faecesc 92.1d 96.6 \nTransport \nSubstrate of transporter P-gp, BCRP, and \n\nOATP1B1/3 \nP-gp and not \n\nexcluded BCRP \na. Median Tmax following single doses of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in healthy subjects. \nb. Mean systemic exposure with moderate to high fat meals.  \nc. Single dose administration of [14C]glecaprevir or [14C]pibrentasvir in mass balance studies.  \nd. Oxidative metabolites or their byproducts accounted for 26% of radioactive dose. No glecaprevir metabolites \n\nwere observed in plasma. \n \nIn patients with chronic hepatitis C infection without cirrhosis, following 3 days of monotherapy with \neither glecaprevir 300 mg per day (N=6) or pibrentasvir 120 mg per day (N=8) alone, geometric mean \nAUC24 values were 13600 ng∙h/mL for glecaprevir and 459 ng∙h/mL for pibrentasvir. Estimation of \nthe pharmacokinetic parameters using population pharmacokinetic models has inherent uncertainty \ndue to dose non-linearity and cross interaction between glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. Based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic models for Maviret in chronic hepatitis C patients, steady-state AUC24 \nvalues for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were 4800 and 1430 ng∙h/mL in subjects without cirrhosis \n(N=1804), and 10500 and 1530 ng∙h/mL in subjects with cirrhosis (N=280), respectively. Relative to \nhealthy subjects (N=230), population estimates of AUC24, ss were similar (10% difference) for \nglecaprevir and 34% lower for pibrentasvir in HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nGlecaprevir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner (1200 mg QD had 516-fold \nhigher exposure than 200 mg QD) which may be related to saturation of uptake and efflux \ntransporters. \n \nPibrentasvir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses up to 120 mg, (over \n10-fold exposure increase at 120 mg QD compared to 30 mg QD), but exhibited linear \n\n\n\n21 \n\npharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 120 mg. The non-linear exposure increase <120 mg may be related to \nsaturation of efflux transporters. \n \nPibrentasvir bioavailability when coadministered with glecaprevir is 3-fold of pibrentasvir alone. \nGlecaprevir is affected to a lower extent by coadministration with pibrentasvir. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations  \n \nRace/ethnicity \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on race or ethnicity. \n \nGender/weight \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on gender or body weight. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in elderly patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nHCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (12 to 88 years) analysed, age did not have a \nclinically relevant effect on the exposure to glecaprevir or pibrentasvir. \n \nPaediatric Population \nNo dose adjustment of Maviret is required in adolescents 12 years and older. Exposures of glecaprevir \nand pibrentasvir in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years were comparable to those in adults from Phase \n2/3 studies. The pharmacokinetics of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been established in \npaediatric patients <12 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were increased ≤ 56% in non-HCV infected subjects with mild, \nmoderate, severe, or end-stage renal impairment not on dialysis compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were similar with and without dialysis (≤ 18% \ndifference) in dialysis-dependent non-HCV infected subjects. In population pharmacokinetic analysis \nof HCV-infected subjects, 86% higher glecaprevir and 54% higher pibrentasvir AUC were observed \nfor subjects with end stage renal disease, with or without dialysis, compared to subjects with normal \nrenal function.  Larger increases may be expected when unbound concentration is considered. \n \nOverall, the changes in exposures of Maviret in HCV-infected subjects with renal impairment with or \nwithout dialysis were not clinically significant. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAt the clinical dose, compared to non-HCV infected subjects with normal hepatic function, glecaprevir \nAUC was 33% higher in Child-Pugh A subjects, 100% higher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and increased \nto 11-fold in Child-Pugh C subjects. Pibrentasvir AUC was similar in Child-Pugh A subjects, 26% \nhigher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and 114% higher in Child-Pugh C subjects. Larger increases may be \nexpected when unbound concentration is considered.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that following administration of Maviret in HCV-\ninfected subjects with compensated cirrhosis, exposure of glecaprevir was approximately 2-fold and \npibrentasvir exposure was similar to non-cirrhotic HCV-infected subjects. The mechanism for the \ndifferences between glecaprevir exposure in chronic Hepatitis C patients with or without cirrhosis is \nunknown. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir were not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including \nbacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo \nrodent micronucleus assays. Carcinogenicity studies with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been \nconducted.  \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nNo effects on mating, female or male fertility, or early embryonic development were observed in \nrodents at up to the highest dose tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir \nwere approximately 63 and 102 times higher, respectively, than the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended dose.  \n \nIn animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when the components \nof Maviret were administered separately during organogenesis at exposures up to 53 times (rats; \nglecaprevir) or 51 and 1.5 times (mice and rabbits, respectively; pibrentasvir) the human exposures at \nthe recommended dose of Maviret. Maternal toxicity (anorexia, lower body weight, and lower body \nweight gain) with some embryofoetal toxicity (increase in post-implantation loss and number of \nresorptions and a decrease in mean foetal body weight), precluded the ability to evaluate glecaprevir in \nthe rabbit at clinical exposures.  There were no developmental effects with either compound in rodent \nperi/postnatal developmental studies in which maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and \npibrentasvir were approximately 47 and 74 times, respectively, the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended dose. Unchanged glecaprevir was the main component observed in the milk of lactating \nrats without effect on nursing pups. Pibrentasvir was the only component observed in the milk of \nlactating rats without effect on nursing pups. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Maviret is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Maviret \n3. How to take Maviret \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Maviret \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Maviret is and what it is used for \n \nMaviret is an antiviral medicine used to treat adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years old) with \nlong-term (‘chronic’) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis C \nvirus). It contains the active substances glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. \n \nMaviret works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells. This allows \nthe infection to be eliminated from the body.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Maviret \n \nDo not take Maviret if: \n• you are allergic to glecaprevir, pibrentasvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \nin section 6 of this leaflet). \n• you have severe liver problems other than from hepatitis C. \n• you are taking the following medicines: \n\n• atazanavir (for HIV infection)  \n• atorvastatin or simvastatin (to lower blood cholesterol)  \n• carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone (normally used for epilepsy) \n• dabigatran etexilate (to prevent blood clots)  \n• ethinyl oestradiol-containing medicines (such as contraception medicines, including \n\nvaginal rings and tablets) \n• rifampicin (for infections)  \n• St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), (herbal remedy used for mild depression). \n\n \nDo not take Maviret if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Maviret. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you have the following because your doctor may want to check you more \nclosely:  \n• liver problems other than hepatitis C \n• current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus \n• diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment of your \n\ndiabetes medication after starting Maviret.
