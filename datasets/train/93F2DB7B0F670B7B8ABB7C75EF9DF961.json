NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nVisudyne 15 mg powder for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 15 mg of verteporfin. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml contains 2 mg of verteporfin. 7.5 ml of reconstituted solution contains 15 mg \n\nof verteporfin. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for solution for infusion \n\n \n\nDark green to black powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nVisudyne is indicated for the treatment of \n\n- adults with exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with predominantly \n\nclassic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) or \n\n- adults with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nVisudyne should be administered only by ophthalmologists experienced in the management of patients \n\nwith age-related macular degeneration or with pathological myopia. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults, including the elderly (\u226565 years old) \nVisudyne photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a two-step process: \n\n \n\nThe first step is a 10-minute intravenous infusion of Visudyne at a dose of 6 mg/m2 body surface area, \n\ndiluted in 30 ml infusion solution (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nThe second step is the light activation of Visudyne at 15 minutes after the start of the infusion (see \n\n\u201cMethod of administration\u201d). \n\n \n\nPatients should be re-evaluated every 3 months. In the event of recurrent CNV leakage, Visudyne \n\ntherapy may be given up to 4 times per year. \n\n \n\nTreatment of the second eye with Visudyne \n\nThere are no clinical data to support concomitant treatment of the second eye. However, if treatment \n\nof the second eye is deemed necessary, light should be applied to the second eye immediately after \n\nlight application in the first eye but no later than 20 minutes from the start of the infusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nVisudyne therapy should be considered carefully in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction or \n\nbiliary obstruction. No experience is available in these patients. Since verteporfin is excreted primarily \n\nvia the biliary (hepatic) route, increased verteporfin exposure is possible. Verteporfin exposure is not \n\nsignificantly increased in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see \u201cBiotransformation\u201d and \n\n\u201cElimination\u201d under section 5.2) and does not require any dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nVisudyne is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nVisudyne has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However the pharmacological \n\ncharacteristics do not indicate any need to adjust the dose (see \u201cBiotransformation\u201d and \u201cElimination\u201d \n\nunder section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Visudyne in the paediatric population have not been established. Visudyne \n\nis not indicated in this population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is intended for intravenous infusion only. \n\n \n\nFor the light activation of Visudyne, a diode laser generating non-thermal red light (wavelength \n\n689 nm \uf0b1 3 nm) is used via a slit lamp mounted fibre optic device and a suitable contact lens. At the \n\nrecommended light intensity of 600 mW/cm2, it takes 83 seconds to deliver the required light dose of \n\n50 J/cm2. \n\n \n\nThe greatest linear dimension of the choroidal neovascular lesion is estimated using fluorescein \n\nangiography and fundus photography. Fundus cameras with a magnification within the range of \n\n2.4 - 2.6X are recommended. The treatment spot should cover all neovasculature, blood and/or \n\nblocked fluorescence. To ensure treatment of poorly demarcated lesion borders, an additional margin \n\nof 500 \u00b5m should be added around the visible lesion. The nasal edge of the treatment spot must be at \n\nleast 200 \uf06dm from the temporal edge of the optic disc. The maximum spot size used for the first \n\ntreatment in the clinical studies was 6,400 \uf06dm. For treatment of lesions that are larger than the \n\nmaximum treatment spot size, apply the light to the greatest possible area of active lesion. \n\n \n\nIt is important to follow the above recommendations to achieve the optimal treatment effect. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nVisudyne is also contraindicated in patients with porphyria and in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see \u201cHepatic impairment\u201d under section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity and exposure to light \n\n \n\nPatients who receive Visudyne will become photosensitive for 48 hours after the infusion. During that \n\nperiod, patients should avoid exposure of unprotected skin, eyes or other body organs to direct \n\nsunlight or bright indoor light such as tanning salons, bright halogen lighting, or high power lighting in \n\nsurgery operating rooms or dental surgeries. Prolonged exposure to light from light-emitting medical \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndevices such as pulse oximeters should also be avoided for 48 hours following Visudyne \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nIf patients have to go outdoors in daylight during the first 48 hours after treatment, they must protect \n\ntheir skin and eyes by wearing protective clothing and dark sunglasses. UV sunscreens are not \n\neffective in protecting against photosensitivity reactions. \n\n \n\nAmbient indoor light is safe. Patients should not stay in the dark and should be encouraged to expose \n\ntheir skin to ambient indoor light, as it will help eliminate the medicinal product quickly through the \n\nskin by a process called photobleaching. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction \n\n \n\nVisudyne therapy should be considered carefully in patients with moderate hepatic impairment or \n\nbiliary obstruction since no experience has been gained in these patients. Since verteporfin is excreted \n\nprimarily via the biliary (hepatic) route, increased verteporfin exposure is possible. \n\n \n\nRisk of severe decrease of vision \n\n \n\nPatients who experience a severe decrease of vision (equivalent to 4 lines or more) within one week \n\nafter treatment should not be re-treated, at least until their vision has completely recovered to pre-\n\ntreatment level and the potential benefits and risks of subsequent treatment have been carefully \n\nconsidered by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nExtravasation of the solution for infusion \n\n \n\nExtravasation of Visudyne, especially if the affected area is exposed to light, can cause severe pain, \n\ninflammation, swelling, blistering or discoloration at the injection site. The relief of pain may require \n\nanalgesic treatment. Localised (skin) necrosis at the injection site following extravasation has also \n\nbeen reported. If extravasation occurs, infusion should be stopped immediately. Protect the affected \n\narea thoroughly from bright direct light until swelling and discoloration have disappeared, and put \n\ncold compresses on the injection site. To avoid extravasation, a free-flowing intravenous line should \n\nbe established before starting Visudyne infusion and the line should be monitored. The largest possible \n\narm vein, preferably the antecubital, should be used for the infusion and small veins in the back of the \n\nhand should be avoided. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nChest pain, vasovagal reactions and hypersensitivity reactions related to Visudyne infusion have been \n\nreported. Both vasovagal and hypersensitivity reactions are associated with general symptoms such as \n\nsyncope, sweating, dizziness, rash, dyspnoea, flushing, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate. \n\nOn rare occasions these reactions may be severe and potentially include convulsions. Patients should \n\nbe under close medical supervision during the Visudyne infusion. \n\n \n\nCases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving Visudyne. If an anaphylactic \n\nor other serious allergic reaction occurs during or following infusion, administration of Visudyne \n\nshould be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nAnaesthesia \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the use of Visudyne in anaesthetised patients. In sedated or anaesthetised \n\npigs, a Visudyne dose significantly higher than the recommended dose in patients given as a bolus \n\ninjection caused severe haemodynamic effects including death, probably as a result of complement \n\nactivation. Pre-dosing with diphenhydramine diminished these effects, suggesting that histamine may \n\nplay a role in this process. This effect was not observed in conscious non-sedated pigs, or in any other \n\nspecies, including man. Verteporfin at more than 5 times the expected maximum plasma concentration \n\nin treated patients, caused a low level of complement activation in human blood in vitro. No clinically \n\n\n\n5 \n\nrelevant complement activation was reported in clinical trials but anaphylactic reactions have been \n\nreported during post-marketing surveillance. Patients should be under close medical supervision \n\nduring the Visudyne infusion and caution should be exercised when Visudyne treatment under general \n\nanaesthesia is considered. \n\n \n\nOther \n\n \n\nVisudyne contains small amounts of butylated hydroxytoluene (E321), which may be irritant to eyes, \n\nskin and mucous membranes. Therefore it must be washed off extensively with water in the event of \n\ndirect contact. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n\n \n\nOther photosensitising agents \n\n \n\nIt is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising medicinal products (e.g. tetracyclines, \n\nsulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea, hypoglycaemic medicinal products, thiazide diuretics, \n\nand griseofulvin) could increase the potential for photosensitivity reactions. Caution should therefore \n\nbe exercised when using Visudyne concomitantly with other photosensitising medicinal products (see \n\n\u201cPhotosensitivity and exposure to light\u201d under section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAgents which increase verteporfin uptake in the vascular endothelium \n\n \n\nAgents such as calcium channel blockers, polymixin B, and radiation therapy are known to alter the \n\nvascular endothelium. Based on theoretical data and despite the lack of clinical evidence these agents \n\nmight result in enhanced verteporfin tissue-uptake when used concurrently. \n\n \n\nFree radical scavengers \n\n \n\nAlthough there is no clinical evidence, theoretical data suggest that antioxidants (e.g. beta-carotene) or \n\nmedicinal products which scavenge free radicals (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), formate, mannitol \n\nor alcohol) might quench the activated oxygen species generated by verteporfin, resulting in decreased \n\nverteporfin activity. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products which antagonise blood vessel occlusion \n\n \n\nSince blood vessel occlusion is the major mechanism of verteporfin action, there is a theoretical \n\npossibility that agents such as vasodilators and those which diminish clotting and platelet aggregation \n\n(e.g. thromboxane A2 inhibitors) can antagonise the action of verteporfin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for verteporfin. Studies in animals have shown \n\nteratogenic effects in one species (rat) (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nVisudyne should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (only if the benefit justifies \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nVerteporfin and its diacid metabolic are excreted in human milk in low amounts. It should therefore \n\nnot be administered to nursing mothers, or breastfeeding should be interrupted for 48 hours after \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no human fertility data for verteporfin. In non-clinical studies, no impairment of fertility and \n\nno genotoxicity have been observed (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance is unknown. Patients of \n\nreproductive age should be made aware of the lack of fertility data, and Visudyne should only be given \n\nafter consideration of individual risks and benefits. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nFollowing Visudyne treatment, patients may develop transient visual disturbances such as abnormal \n\nvision, vision decrease, or visual field defects that may interfere with their ability to drive or use \n\nmachines. Patients should not drive or use machines as long as these symptoms persist. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nMost adverse reactions were mild to moderate and transient in nature. Undesirable effects reported in \n\npatients with pathological myopia were similar to those reported in patients with AMD. \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions to Visudyne (verteporfin for infusion) are injection site \n\nreactions (including pain, oedema, inflammation, extravasation, rashes, haemorrhage, discolouration) \n\nand visual impairment (including blurred, fuzzy vision, photopsia, reduced visual acuity and visual \n\nfield defects, including scotoma and black spots). \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions were considered potentially related to Visudyne therapy. The adverse \n\nreactions are listed by system organ class and frequency using the following convention: very common \n\n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \n\nvery rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon Hypersensitivity1. \n\nNot known Anaphylactic reaction. \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nCommon Hypercholesteraemia. \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Syncope, headache, dizziness1. \n\nUncommon Hyperesthesia. \n\nNot known Vasovagal reactions1. \n\nEye disorders \n\nCommon Severe reduced visual acuity2, visual impairment such as reduced \n\nvisual acuity, blurred, fuzzy vision, or photopsia, visual field defect \n\nsuch as scotoma, grey or dark haloes and black spots. \n\nUncommon Retinal detachment, retinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, \n\nretinal oedema. \n\nRare Retinal ischaemia (retinal or choroidal vessel non-perfusion). \n\nNot known Retinal pigment epithelial tear, macular oedema. \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nNot known Myocardial infarction3. \n\nVascular disorders \n\nUncommon Hypertension. \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Dyspnoea1. \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Nausea. \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon Photosensitivity reaction4. \n\nUncommon Rash, urticaria, pruritus1. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Injection site pain, injection site oedema, injection site \n\ninflammation, injection site extravasation, asthenia. \n\nUncommon Injection site hypersensitivity, injection site haemorrhage, injection \n\nsite discoloration, pyrexia, pain. \n\nRare Malaise1. \n\nNot known Injection site vesicles, injection site necrosis. \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nCommon Infusion-related chest pain5, infusion-related reaction primarily \n\npresented as back pain5, 6. \n\n1 Vasovagal reactions and hypersensitivity reactions related to Visudyne infusion have been \n\nreported. General symptoms can include headache, malaise, syncope, hyperhydrosis, dizziness, \n\nrash, urticaria, pruritus, dyspnoea, flushing, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate. On \n\nrare occasions these reactions may be severe and potentially include convulsions. \n2 Severely reduced visual acuity, equivalent to 4 lines or more, within seven days after treatment \n\nwas reported in 2.1 % of the verteporfin-treated patients in the placebo-controlled ocular Phase \n\nIII clinical studies and in less than 1 % of patients in uncontrolled clinical studies. The reaction \n\noccurred mainly in patients with occult only (4.9 %) or minimally classic CNV lesions in \n\npatients with AMD and was not reported for placebo-treated patients. Partial recovery of vision \n\nwas observed in some patients. \n3 Myocardial infarction has been reported, particularly in patients with previous cardiovascular \n\nhistory, sometimes within 48 hours after the infusion. \n4 Photosensitivity reactions (in 2.2 % of patients and <1 % of Visudyne courses) occurred in the \n\nform of sunburn following exposure to sunlight, usually within 24 hours from Visudyne \n\ntreatment. Such reactions should be avoided by compliance with the photosensitivity protection \n\ninstructions given in section 4.4. \n5 Infusion-related back and chest pain, which may radiate to other areas, including, but not \n\nlimited to, the pelvis, shoulder girdle or rib cage. \n6 The higher incidence of back pain during infusion in the Visudyne group was not associated \n\nwith any evidence of haemolysis or allergic reaction and usually resolved by the end of the \n\ninfusion. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdose of the medicinal product and/or light in the treated eye may result in non-selective non-\n\nperfusion of normal retinal vessels, with the possibility of severe vision decrease. \n\n \n\nOverdose of the medicinal product may result in the prolongation of the period during which the \n\npatient remains photosensitive. In such cases, the patient should prolong skin and eye protection from \n\ndirect sunlight or bright indoor light for a period proportionate with the overdose given. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nVerteporfin, also referred to as benzoporphyrin derivative monoacids (BPD-MA) consists of a \n\n1:1 mixture of the equally active regioisomers BPD-MAC and BPD-MAD. It is used as a light-activated \n\nmedicinal product (photosensitiser). \n\n \n\nBy itself, the clinically recommended dose of verteporfin is not cytotoxic. It produces cytotoxic agents \n\nonly when activated by light in the presence of oxygen. When energy absorbed by the porphyrin is \n\ntransferred to oxygen, highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen is generated. Singlet oxygen causes \n\ndamage to biological structures within the diffusion range, leading to local vascular occlusion, cell \n\ndamage and, under certain conditions, cell death. \n\n \n\nThe selectivity of PDT using verteporfin is based, in addition to the localised light exposure, on \n\nselective and rapid uptake and retention of verteporfin by rapidly proliferating cells including the \n\nendothelium of choroidal neovasculature. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAge-related macular degeneration with predominantly classic subfoveal lesions \n\n \n\nVisudyne has been studied in two randomised, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicentre studies \n\n(BPD OCR 002 A and B or Treatment of Age-related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic \n\nTherapy [TAP]). A total of 609 patients were enrolled (402 Visudyne, 207 placebo). \n\n \n\nThe objective was to demonstrate the long-term efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy with \n\nverteporfin in limiting the decrease in visual acuity in patients with subfoveal choroidal \n\nneovascularisation due to age-related macular degeneration. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was responder rate, defined as the proportion of patients who lost less \n\nthan 15 letters (equivalent to 3 lines) of visual acuity (measured with the ETDRS charts) at month \n\n12 relative to baseline. \n\n \n\nThe following inclusion criteria were considered for the treatment: patients older than 50 years of age, \n\npresence of CNV secondary to AMD, presence of classic lesion components in the CNV (defined as a \n\nwell-demarcated area of the fluorescence on angiography), CNV located subfoveally (involved the \n\ngeometric centre of the foveal avascular zone), area of classic plus occult CNV \uf0b350% of the total \n\nlesion surface, greatest linear dimension of the entire lesion \uf0a39 Macular Photocoagulation Study \n\n(MPS) disc area, and a best-corrected visual acuity between 34 and 73 letters (i.e. approximately 20/40 \n\nand 20/200) in the treated eye. Presence of occult CNV lesions (fluorescence not well demarcated on \n\nthe angiogram) was allowed. \n\n \n\nResults indicate that, at 12 months, Visudyne was statistically superior to placebo in terms of the \n\nproportion of patients responding to the treatment. The studies showed a difference of 15 % between \n\ntreatment groups (61% for Visudyne-treated patients compared to 46% placebo-treated patients, \n\np<0.001, ITT analysis). This 15% difference between treatment groups was confirmed at 24 months \n\n(53% Visudyne versus 38% placebo, p<0.001). \n\n \n\nThe subgroup of patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions (N=243; Visudyne 159, placebo 84) \n\nwere more likely to exhibit a larger treatment benefit. After 12 months, these patients showed a \n\ndifference of 28% between treatment groups (67% for Visudyne patients compared to 39% for placebo \n\npatients, p<0.001); the benefit was maintained at 24 months (59% versus 31%, p<0.001). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nIn relation to TAP extension: \n\nIn patients followed from month 24 onwards and treated with uncontrolled, open-label Visudyne \n\ntreatment as needed, long-term extension data suggest that month-24 vision outcomes may be \n\nsustained for up to 60 months. \n\n \n\nIn the TAP study in all lesion types, the average number of treatments per year were 3.5 in the first \n\nyear after diagnosis and 2.4 in the second for the randomised placebo-controlled phase and 1.3 in the \n\nthird year, 0.4 in the fourth and 0.1 in the fifth year for the open-label extension phase. \n\n \n\nNo additional safety concern was identified. \n\n \n\nAge-related macular degeneration with occult with no classic lesions \n\n \n\nThe benefit of the product in the AMD patient population who have occult subfoveal CNV with \n\nevidence of recent or ongoing disease progression has not been demonstrated consistently. \n\n \n\nTwo randomised, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicentre, 24-month studies (BPD OCR 003 \n\nAMD, or Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy-AMD [VIP-AMD], and BPD OCR 013, or Visudyne \n\nin Occult Choroidal Neovascularisation [VIO]) were conducted in patients with AMD characterised by \n\noccult with no classic subfoveal CNV. \n\n \n\nThe VIO study included patients with occult with no classic subfoveal CNV with a visual acuity score \n\nof 73-34 letters (20/40-20/200), and patients with lesions >4 MPS disc areas were to have baseline \n\nvisual acuity <65 letters (<20/50). 364 patients (244 verteporfin, 120 placebo) were enrolled in this \n\nstudy. The primary efficacy parameter was the same as in TAP (see above), with an additional \n\nendpoint of month 24 defined. Another efficacy parameter was also defined: the proportion of patients \n\nwho lost less than 30 letters (equivalent to 6 lines) of visual acuity at months 12 and 24 relative to \n\nbaseline. The study did not show statistically significant results on the primary efficacy parameter at \n\nmonth 12 (15-letter responder rate 62.7% versus 55.0%, p=0.150; 30-letter responder rate 84.0% \n\nversus 83.3%, p=0.868) or at month 24 (15-letter responder rate 53.3% versus 47.5%, p=0.300; 30-\n\nletter responder rate 77.5% versus 75.0%, p=0.602). A higher percentage of patients who received \n\nVisudyne, compared with those who received placebo, experienced adverse events (88.1% versus \n\n81.7%), associated adverse events (23.0% versus 7.5%), events leading to discontinuation (11.9% \n\nversus 3.3%) and events leading to death (n=10 [4.1%] versus n=1 [0.8%]). No death was considered \n\nto be related to treatment. \n\n \n\nThe VIP-AMD included patients with occult with no classic subfoveal CNV with a visual acuity score \n\nof >50 letters (20/100). This study also included patients with classic containing CNV with a visual \n\nacuity score >70 letters (20/40). 339 patients (225 verteporfin, 114 placebo) were enrolled in this \n\nstudy. The efficacy parameter was the same as in TAP and VIO (see above). At month 12, the study \n\ndid not show statistically significant results on the primary efficacy parameter (responder rate 49.3% \n\nversus 45.6%, p=0.517). At month 24, a statistically significant difference of 12.9% in favour of \n\nVisudyne compared to placebo was observed (46.2% versus 33.3%, p=0.023). A group of patients \n\nwho had occult with no classic lesions (n=258) showed a statistically significant difference of 13.7% \n\nin favour of Visudyne compared to placebo (45.2% versus 31.5%, p=0.032). A higher percentage of \n\npatients who received Visudyne, compared with those who received placebo, experienced adverse \n\nevents (89.3% versus 82.5 %), associated adverse events (42.7% versus 18.4%) and events leading to \n\ndiscontinuation (6.2% versus 0.9%). A lower percentage of Visudyne patients had events leading to \n\ndeath (n=4 [1.8%] versus n=3 [2.6%]); no death was considered to be related to treatment. \n\n \n\nPathological myopia \n\n \n\nOne multicentre, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomised study (BPD OCR 003 PM [VIP-\n\nPM]) was conducted in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation caused by pathological \n\nmyopia. A total of 120 patients (81 Visudyne, 39 placebo) were enrolled in the study. The posology \n\nand retreatments were the same as in the AMD studies. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nAt month 12, there was a benefit of Visudyne for the primary efficacy endpoint (percentage of patients \n\nwho lost less than 3 lines of visual acuity) \u2013 86% for Visudyne versus 67% for placebo, p=0.011. The \n\npercentage of patients who lost less than 1.5 lines was 72% for Visudyne and 44% for placebo \n\n(p=0.003). \n\n \n\nAt month 24, 79% Visudyne patients versus 72% placebo patients had lost less than 3 lines of visual \n\nacuity (p=0.38). The percentage of patients who lost less than 1.5 lines was 64% for Visudyne and \n\n49% for placebo (p=0.106). \n\n \n\nThis indicates that clinical benefit may diminish over time. \n\n \n\nIn relation to VIP-PM extension: \n\nIn patients followed from month 24 onwards and treated with uncontrolled, open-label Visudyne \n\ntreatment as needed, long-term extension data suggest that month-24 vision outcomes may be \n\nsustained for up to 60 months. \n\n \n\nIn the VIP-PM study in pathological myopia, the average number of treatments per year were 3.5 in \n\nthe first year after diagnosis and 1.8 in the second for the randomised placebo-controlled phase and 0.4 \n\nin the third year, 0.2 in the fourth and 0.1 in the fifth year for the open-label extension phase. \n\n \n\nNo additional safety concern was identified. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe two regioisomers of verteporfin exhibit similar pharmacokinetic properties of distribution and \n\nelimination and thus both isomers are considered verteporfin as a whole from the pharmacokinetic \n\nperspective. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nCmax after a 10-minute infusion of 6 and 12 mg/m2 body surface area in the target population is \n\napproximately 1.5 and 3.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The volume of distribution of around 0.60 l/kg at \n\nsteady state and clearance of around 101 ml/h/kg has been reported following a 10-minute infusion in \n\ndose range of 3-14 mg/m2. A maximum 2-fold inter-individual variation in plasma concentrations at \n\nCmax (immediately after end of the infusion) and at the time of light administration was found for each \n\nVisudyne dose administered. \n\n \n\nIn whole human blood, 90% of verteporfin is associated with plasma and 10 % associated with blood \n\ncells, of which very little was membrane associated. In human plasma, 90% of verteporfin is \n\nassociated with plasma lipoprotein fractions and approximately 6% are associated with albumin. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe ester group of verteporfin is hydrolysed via plasma and hepatic esterases, leading to the formation \n\nof benzoporphyrin derivative diacid (BPD-DA). BPD-DA is also a photosensitiser but its systemic \n\nexposure is low (5-10% of the verteporfin exposure, suggesting that most of the active substance is \n\neliminated unchanged). In vitro studies did not show any significant involvement of oxidative \n\nmetabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nPlasma elimination half-life mean values ranged from approximately 5\u20136 hours for verteporfin. \n\n \n\nCombined excretion of verteporfin and BPD-DA in human urine was less than 1%, suggesting biliary \n\nexcretion. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe extent of exposure and the maximal plasma concentration are proportional to the dose between 6 \n\nand 20 mg/m2. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly (65 years of age or above) \n\nAlthough mean plasma Cmax and AUC values in elderly patients who received verteporfin are higher \n\nthan those in young volunteers or patients, these differences are not considered to be clinically \n\nsignificant. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study of patients with mild hepatic impairment (defined as having two abnormal hepatic function \n\ntests at enrolment), AUC and Cmax were not significantly different from the control group. Half-life, \n\nhowever, was significantly increased by approximately 20%. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo studies on the pharmacokinetics of verteporfin in patients with renal impairment are reported. The \n\nrenal excretion of verteporfin and its metabolite is minimal (<1% of the verteporfin dose) and thus, \n\nclinically significant changes in verteporfin exposure in patients with renal impairment are unlikely. \n\n \n\nEthnic groups/races \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of verteporfin have been reported to be similar in healthy Caucasian and \n\nJapanese men after a dose of 6 mg/m2 by a 10-minute infusion. \n\n \n\nEffects of gender \n\nAt the intended dose, pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly affected by gender. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSingle and repeated dose toxicity \n\n \n\nThe acute and light-dependent toxicity of verteporfin was characterised by dose dependent localised \n\ndeep-tissue damage as a consequence of the pharmacological effect of PDT with verteporfin. Toxicity \n\nobserved following multiple doses of verteporfin without light was associated mainly with effects on \n\nthe haematopoietic system. The extent and severity of these effects were consistent among all studies \n\nand were dependent on drug dose and dosing duration. \n\n \n\nOphthalmic toxicity \n\n \n\nLevels of ocular toxicity in healthy rabbits and monkeys, particularly on the retina/choroid, correlated \n\nwith medicinal product dose, light dose, and time of light treatment. A retinal toxicity study in healthy \n\ndogs with intravenous verteporfin and ambient light on the eye showed no treatment-related ocular \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nIn pregnant rats, intravenous verteporfin doses of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 40-fold human \n\nexposure at 6 mg/m2 based on AUCinf in female rats) were associated with an increased incidence of \n\nanophthalmia/microphthalmia and doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 125-fold the human \n\nexposure at 6 mg/m2 based on AUCinf in female rats) were associated with an increased incidence of \n\nwavy ribs and anophthalmia/microphthalmia. There were no teratogenic effects observed in rabbits at \n\ndoses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 20-fold human exposure at 6 mg/m2 based on body surface \n\narea). \n\n \n\nNo effect on male or female fertility has been observed in rats following intravenous verteporfin doses \n\n\n\n12 \n\nof up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 60 and 40-fold human exposure at 6 mg/m2 based on AUCinf in \nmale and female rats, respectively). \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of verteporfin. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity \n\n \n\nVerteporfin was not genotoxic in the absence or presence of light in the usual battery of genotoxic \n\ntests. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces the formation of reactive oxygen species and \n\nhas been reported to result in DNA damage including DNA strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, DNA \n\ndegradation, and DNA-protein cross links which may result in chromosomal aberrations, sister \n\nchromatid exchanges (SCE) and mutations. It is not known how the potential for DNA damage with \n\nPDT agents translates into human risk. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Visudyne is and what it is used for \n\n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Visudyne is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Visudyne is \n\nVisudyne contains the active substance verteporfin, which is activated by light from a laser in a \n\ntreatment called photodynamic therapy. When you are given an infusion of Visudyne, it is distributed \n\nwithin your body through the blood vessels, including the blood vessels at the back of the eye. When \n\nthe laser light is shone into the eye, Visudyne is activated. \n\n \n\nWhat Visudyne is used for \n\nVisudyne is used to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration and pathological myopia. \n\n \n\nThese diseases lead to vision loss. Vision loss is caused by new blood vessels (choroidal \n\nneovascularisation) that damage the retina (the light-sensitive membrane that lines the back of the \n\neye). There are two types of choroidal neovascularisation: classic and occult. \n\n \n\nVisudyne is used for the treatment of predominantly classic choroidal neovascularisation in adults \n\nwith age-related macular degeneration, and also for the treatment of all types of choroidal \n\nneovascularisation in adults with pathological myopia. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Visudyne \n\n \n\nYou should not be given Visudyne \n\n- if you are allergic to verteporfin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you have porphyria (a rare condition that may increase sensitivity to light). \n\n- if you have any severe liver problems. \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Visudyne. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Visudyne \n\n- If you experience any infusion-related problems or symptoms during or following the \ntreatment such as chest pain, sweating, dizziness, rash, breathlessness, flushing, irregular heart \n\n\n\n23 \n\nbeat or seizure, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately, as the infusion may need to be \n\nstopped and your condition may need to be treated urgently. Infusion-related problems may also \n\ninclude sudden loss of consciousness. \n\n- If you have any liver problems or a blockage of your bile duct, please tell your doctor before \nstarting Visudyne therapy. \n\n- If, during the infusion, Visudyne goes outside the vein, and especially if the affected area is \nexposed to light, this can cause pain, swelling, blistering and a change in skin colour in the area \n\nof the leakage. If this happens, the infusion needs to be stopped and the skin treated with cold \n\ncompresses and thoroughly protected from light until the skin colour returns to normal. You \n\nmay need to take a painkiller. \n\n- You will be sensitive to bright light for 48 hours after the infusion. During that time, avoid \nexposure to direct sunlight, bright indoor lights such as in tanning salons, bright halogen \n\nlighting, high power lighting as used by surgeons or dentists, or light from light-emitting \n\nmedical devices such as pulse oximeters (used to measure oxygen in blood). If you have to go \n\noutdoors during daylight in the first 48 hours after treatment, you must protect your skin and \n\neyes by wearing protective clothing and dark sunglasses. Sunscreens offer no protection. \n\nNormal indoor lighting is safe. \n\n- Do not stay in the dark because exposure to normal indoor lighting will help your body to \neliminate Visudyne more quickly. \n\n- If you experience any eye problems after the treatment, such as a vision loss, talk to your \ndoctor. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Visudyne \n\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines, as they may increase \n\nyour sensitivity to light: \n\n- tetracyclines or sulphonamides (used to treat bacterial infection), \n\n- phenothiazines (used to treat psychiatric disorders, or nausea and vomiting), \n\n- sulfonylurea (used to treat diabetes), \n\n- medicines used to lower blood sugar, \n\n- thiazide diuretics (used to reduce high blood pressure), \n\n- griseofulvin (used to treat fungal infection), \n\n- calcium channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure, angina and abnormal heart \n\nrhythms), \n\n- antioxidants such as beta-carotene or medicines that can remove or inactivate free radicals (such \n\nas dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), formate, mannitol and alcohol), \n\n- vasodilators (used to widen blood vessels resulting from smooth muscle relaxation), \n\n- or, if you are undergoing radiation therapy, \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- There is very little experience of using Visudyne in pregnant women. It is important to tell your \n\ndoctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. \n\nYou should only be given Visudyne if your doctor considers it absolutely essential. \n\n- Verteporfin passes into human milk in low amounts. Please tell your doctor if you are \nbreastfeeding. He/she will decide whether you should be given Visudyne. It is recommended \n\nthat, if you are given Visudyne, you do not breastfeed for 48 hours after administration. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nAfter Visudyne treatment you may have some vision problems, such as abnormal or decreased vision, \n\nwhich may be temporary. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your \n\nvision improves. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nVisudyne contains small amounts of butylated hydroxytoluene (E321) \n\nThis ingredient is irritant to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. If you come into direct contact with \n\nVisudyne, you must therefore wash it off thoroughly with water. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Visudyne is used \n\n \n\nTreatment with Visudyne is a two-step process \n\n \n\n\u2022 First your doctor or the pharmacist will prepare the Visudyne infusion solution. It will be \nadministered by your doctor or nurse into a vein using a drip (intravenous infusion). \n\n \n\n\u2022 The second step is the activation of Visudyne in the eye 15 minutes after the start of the \ninfusion. Your doctor will put a special contact lens onto your eye and treat your eye using a \n\nspecial laser. It takes 83 seconds to deliver the laser dose required to activate Visudyne. During \n\nthis time, you will have to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions and keep your eyes still. \n\n \n\nIf necessary, Visudyne therapy can be repeated every 3 months, up to 4 times per year. \n\n \n\nUse in children \n\nVisudyne is a treatment for adults only and not indicated for the use in children. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Visudyne than you should be \n\nOverdose of Visudyne may prolong the time during which you are sensitive to light and you may need \n\nto follow the protection instructions given in section 2 for longer than 48 hours. Your doctor will \n\nadvise you. \n\n \n\nOverdose of Visudyne and light in the treated eye may result in severe vision decrease. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSome side effects could be serious: \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\u2022 Eye disorders: severe decrease of vision (loss of 4 lines or more within 7 days of treatment), \nvisual disturbances such as blurred, hazy or fuzzy vision, flashes of light, decreased vision, and \n\na change in the field of vision in the treated eye such as grey or dark shadows, blind spots or \n\nblack spots. \n\n\u2022 General disorders: Hypersensitivity (allergic reactions), syncope (fainting), headache, light-\nheadedness, breathlessness. \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n\u2022 Eye disorders: bleeding of the retina or into the vitreous humour (the clear gel-like substance \nthat fills the eyeball behind the lens), swelling or fluid retention in the retina and displacement \n\nof the retina in the treated eye. \n\n\u2022 Infusion site side effects: as with other types of injections, some patients experienced bleeding \nat the infusion site, change in skin colour and hypersensitivity.

light from a laser in a treatment called photodynamic therapy. when you are given an infusion of visudyne, it is distributed within your body through the blood vessels, including the blood vessels at the back of the eye. when the laser light is shone into the eye, visudyne is activated. what visudyne is used for visudyne is used to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration and pathological myopia. these diseases lead to vision loss. vision loss is caused by new blood vessels (choroidal neovascularisation) that damage the retina (the light-sensitive membrane that lines the back of the eye). there are two types of choroidal neovascularisation: classic and occult. visudyne is used for the treatment of predominantly classic choroidal neovascularisation in adults with age-related macular degeneration, and also for the treatment of all types of choroidal neovascularisation in adults with pathological myopia.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "visudyne", "Type":

of these apply to you, tell your doctor. you should not be given visudyne. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given visudyne - if you experience any infusion-related problems or symptoms during or following the treatment such as chest pain, sweating, dizziness, rash, breathlessness, flushing, irregular heart 23 beat or seizure, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately, as the infusion may need to be stopped and your condition may need to be treated urgently. infusion-related problems may also include sudden loss of consciousness. - if you have any liver problems or a blockage of your bile duct, please tell your doctor before starting visudyne therapy. - if, during the infusion, visudyne goes outside the vein, and especially if the affected area is exposed to light, this can cause pain, swelling, blistering and a change in skin colour in the area of the leakage. if this happens, the infusion needs to be stopped and the skin treated with cold compresses and thoroughly protected from light until the skin colour returns to normal. you may need to take a painkiller. - you will be sensitive to bright light for 48 hours after the infusion. during that time, avoid exposure to direct sunlight, bright indoor lights such as in tanning salons, bright halogen lighting, high power lighting as used by surgeons or dentists, or light from light-emitting medical devices such as pulse oximeters (used to measure oxygen in blood). if you have to go outdoors during daylight in the first 48 hours after treatment, you must protect your skin and eyes by wearing protective clothing and dark sunglasses. sunscreens offer no protection. normal indoor lighting is safe. - do not stay in the dark because exposure to normal indoor lighting will help your body to eliminate visudyne more quickly. - if you experience any eye problems after the treatment, such as a vision loss, talk to your doctor. other medicines and visudyne tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines, as they may increase your sensitivity to light: - tetracyclines or sulphonamides (used to treat bacterial infection), - phenothiazines (used to treat psychiatric disorders, or nausea and vomiting), - sulfonylurea (used to treat diabetes), - medicines used to lower blood sugar, - thiazide diuretics (used to reduce high blood pressure), - griseofulvin (used to treat fungal infection), - calcium channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure, angina and abnormal heart rhythms), - antioxidants such as beta-carotene or medicines that can remove or inactivate free radicals (such as dimethylsulfoxide (dmso), formate, mannitol and alcohol), - vasodilators (used to widen blood vessels resulting from smooth muscle relaxation), - or, if you are undergoing radiation therapy, pregnancy and breast-feeding - there is very little experience of using visudyne in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. you should only be given visudyne if your doctor considers it absolutely essential. - verteporfin passes into human milk in low amounts. please tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. he/she will decide whether you should be given visudyne. it is recommended that, if you are given visudyne, you do not breastfeed for 48 hours after administration. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines after visudyne treatment you may have some vision problems, such as abnormal or decreased vision, which may be temporary. if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your vision improves. visudyne contains small amounts of butylated hydroxytoluene (e321) this ingredient is irritant to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. if you

onto your eye and treat your eye using a special laser. it takes 83 seconds to deliver the laser dose required to activate visudyne. during this time, you will have to follow your doctor's
