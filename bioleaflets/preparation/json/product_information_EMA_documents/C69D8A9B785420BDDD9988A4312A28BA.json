This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOrphacol 50 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 50 mg of cholic acid. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: Lactose monohydrate (145.79 mg per capsule). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nOblong, opaque, blue and white capsule. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOrphacol is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis due to \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in \ninfants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and monitored by an experienced gastroenterologist/hepatologist or a \npaediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist in the case of paediatric patients. \n \nIn case of persistent lack of therapeutic response to cholic acid monotherapy, other treatment options \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). Patients should be monitored as follows: 3-monthly during the first \nyear, 6-monthly during the subsequent three years and annually thereafter (see below). \n \nPosology \nThe dose must be adjusted for each patient in a specialised unit according to blood and/or urine \nchromatographic bile acid profiles.  \n \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency \nThe daily dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg in infants, children, adolescents and adults. In all age groups, \nthe minimum dose is 50 mg and the dose is adjusted in 50 mg steps. In adults, the daily dose should not \nexceed 500 mg. \n \nΔ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe daily dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg in infants, children, adolescents and adults. In all age groups, \nthe minimum dose is 50 mg and the dose is adjusted in 50 mg steps. In adults, the daily dose should not \nexceed 500 mg.   \n \nThe daily dose may be divided if it consists of more than one capsule in order to mimic the continuous \nproduction of cholic acid in the body and to reduce the number of capsules that need to be taken per \nadministration.  \n \nDuring the initiation of therapy and dose adjustment, serum and/or urine bile acid levels should be \nmonitored intensively (at least every three months during the first year of treatment, every six months \nduring the second year) using suitable analytical techniques. The concentrations of the abnormal bile acid \nmetabolites synthesised in 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency (3β, 7α-dihydroxy- and \n3β, 7α, 12α-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acids) or in Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency \n(3-oxo-7α-hydroxy- and 3-oxo-7α, 12α-dihydroxy-4-cholenoic acids) should be determined. At each \ninvestigation, the need for dose adjustment should be considered. The lowest dose of cholic acid that \neffectively reduces the bile acid metabolites to as close to zero as possible should be chosen.  \n \nPatients that have previously been treated with other bile acids or other cholic acid preparations should be \nclosely monitored in the same manner during the initiation of treatment with Orphacol. The dose should \nbe adjusted accordingly, as described above.  \n \nLiver parameters should also be monitored, preferentially more frequently than serum and/or urine bile \nacid levels. Concurrent elevation of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) and/or serum bile acids above normal levels may indicate overdose. Transient elevations of \ntransaminases at the initiation of cholic acid treatment have been observed and do not indicate the need for \na dose reduction if GGT is not elevated and if serum bile acid levels are falling or in the normal range. \n \nAfter the initiation period, serum and/or urine bile acids (using suitable analytical techniques) and liver \nparameters should be determined annually, at a minimum, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Additional \nor more frequent investigations should be undertaken to monitor therapy during periods of fast growth, \nconcomitant disease and pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (≥65 years old)  \nThere is no experience in elderly patients. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted individually. \n \nRenal impairment  \nNo data are available for patients with renal impairment. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted \nindividually. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nLimited data are available for patients with minor to severe hepatic impairment related to \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency. \nPatients are expected to present with some degree of hepatic impairment at diagnosis, which improves \nunder cholic acid therapy. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted individually. \n \nNo experience exists in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than 3β-\nHydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency and no \ndose recommendation can be given. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored closely (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridemia are expected to poorly \nabsorb cholic acid in the intestine. The cholic acid dose for patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia \nwill have to be established and adjusted as described, but an elevated dose, notably higher than the 500 mg \ndaily limit for adult patients, may be required and safe. \n \nPaediatric population \nCholic acid therapy has been used for infants from one month of age, and for children and adolescents. \nThe dose recommendations reflect the use in this population. The daily dose in infants from 1 month to \n2 years of age, children and adolescents ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg and must be adjusted individually for \neach patient. \n \nMethod of administration \nOrphacol capsules must be taken with food at approximately the same time each day, in the morning \nand/or evening. Administration with food may increase cholic acid bioavailability and improve \ntolerability. Regular and fixed times of administration support the patient’s or caregiver’s compliance. \nCapsules must be swallowed whole with water, without chewing. \nFor infants and children who cannot swallow capsules, the capsules may be opened and the content added \nto infant formula or juice. For additional information, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use of phenobarbital with cholic acid (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCases of severe hepatotoxicity, including cases with fatal outcome, have been reported, with the use of \ncholic acid. Treatment with cholic acid in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment should be given \nunder close monitoring and, for all patients, should be stopped if abnormal hepatocellular function, as \nmeasured by prothrombin time, does not improve within 3 months of the initiation of cholic acid \ntreatment. A concomitant decrease of urine total bile acids should be observed. Treatment should be \nstopped earlier if there are clear indicators of severe hepatic failure. \n \nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia \nPatients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridaemia may have poor \nabsorption of cholic acid from the intestine. The dose of cholic acid in such patients should be established \nand adjusted as described, but an elevated dose, notably higher than the 500 mg daily limit for adult \npatients, may be required.  \n \nExcipients \nOrphacol capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPhenobarbital antagonises the effect of cholic acid. Use of phenobarbital in patients with \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency treated \nwith cholic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Alternative treatments should be used. \n \nCiclosporin alters the pharmacokinetics of cholic acid by inhibition of the hepatic uptake and \nhepatobiliary secretion of bile acids, as well as its pharmacodynamics by inhibition of cholesterol \n7α-hydroxylase. Co-administration should be avoided. If administration of ciclosporin is considered \n\n\n\n5 \n\nnecessary, serum and urine bile acid levels should be closely monitored and the cholic acid dose adjusted \naccordingly. \n \nBile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) and certain antacids (e.g. aluminium \nhydroxide) bind bile acids and lead to their elimination. Administration of these medicinal products is \nexpected to reduce the effect of cholic acid. The dose of bile acid sequestrants or antacids must be \nseparated from the dose of cholic acid by an interval of 5 hours, regardless of which medicinal product is \nadministered first. \n \nThe effect of food on the bioavailability of cholic acid has not been studied. There is a theoretical \npossibility that administration with food may increase cholic acid bioavailability and improve tolerability. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nThere is no need for contraceptive measures in women of childbearing potential treated with cholic acid or \ntheir partners. Women of childbearing potential should conduct a pregnancy test as soon as a pregnancy is \nsuspected. \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data (less than 20 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of cholic acid in \npregnant women. The exposed pregnancies showed no adverse reactions to cholic acid and resulted in \nnormal, healthy children. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nIt is extremely important that pregnant women continue their therapy during pregnancy. As a \nprecautionary measure, pregnant women and their unborn children should be closely monitored.  \n \nBreastfeeding \nCholic acid and its metabolites are excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of Orphacol, no \neffects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Orphacol can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo data on the effects of cholic acid on fertility are available. At therapeutic doses, no effect on fertility is \nanticipated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCholic acid has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nDue to the rarity of the diseases, the information about the most serious and/or most frequently occurring \nadverse reactions is limited. Diarrhoea, increased transaminases and pruritus have been associated with \noverdosage and disappeared after dose reduction. Development of gallstones associated with long-term \ntreatment have been reported in very limited number of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table lists adverse reactions reported in the literature under treatment with cholic acid. The \nfrequency of these reactions is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea \nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminases increased \n\nGallstones \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nThe development of pruritus and/or diarrhoea has been observed during treatment with Orphacol. These \nreactions abated after dose reduction and are suggestive of overdose. Patients presenting with pruritus \nand/or persistent diarrhoea should be investigated for a potential overdose by a serum and/or urine bile \nacid assay (see section 4.9). \n \nGallstones have been reported after long-term therapy. \n \nPaediatric population The presented safety information is derived principally from paediatric patients. The \navailable literature is not sufficient to detect a difference in the safety of cholic acid within paediatric age \ngroups or between paediatric patients and adults. \n \nOther special populations \nPlease refer to section 4.2 for use of Orphacol in special populations. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEpisodes of symptomatic overdose have been reported, including accidental overdose. Clinical features \nwere limited to pruritus and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed elevation of serum gamma \nglutamyltransferase (GGT) transaminases and serum bile acid concentrations. Reduction of the dose led to \nresolution of the clinical signs and correction of abnormal laboratory parameters. \n \nIn the case of an accidental overdose, treatment should be continued at the recommended dose after \nnormalisation of clinical signs and/or biological abnormalities. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Bile and liver therapy, bile acid and derivatives, ATC code: A05AA03  \n \nCholic acid is the predominant primary bile acid in man. In patients with inborn deficiency of \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase and Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase, the biosynthesis of primary \nbile acids is reduced or absent. Both inborn diseases are extremely rare, with a prevalence in Europe of \nabout 3 to 5 patients with 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency per 10 million \ninhabitants, and an estimated ten-fold lower prevalence for Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency. In \nthe absence of treatment, unphysiologic cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile acid metabolites are predominant \nin the liver, serum and urine. The rational basis for treatment consists of restoration of the bile acid-\ndependent component of bile flow enabling restoration of biliary secretion and biliary elimination of toxic \nmetabolites; inhibition of the production of the toxic bile acid metabolites by negative feedback on \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\ncholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis; and improvement of \nthe patient’s nutritional status by correcting intestinal malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. \n \nClinical experience has been reported in the literature from small cohorts of patients and single case \nreports; absolute patient numbers are small due to the rarity of the conditions. This rarity also made the \nconduct of controlled clinical studies impossible. Overall, cholic acid treatment results for about 60 \npatients with 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency are reported in the literature. Detailed \nlong-term data on treatment with cholic acid monotherapy are available for 14 patients observed for up to \n12.9 years. Cholic acid treatment results for seven patients with Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency \nfor up to 14 years are reported in the literature. Detailed medium- to long-term data are available for 5 of \nthese patients, of whom 1 has been treated with cholic acid monotherapy. Oral cholic acid therapy has \nbeen shown to: postpone or obviate the need for liver transplantation; restore normal laboratory \nparameters; improve histological lesions of the liver, and significantly improve all of the patient’s \nsymptoms. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine during cholic acid therapy shows the presence of cholic \nacid and a marked reduction, or even complete elimination of the toxic bile acid metabolites. This reflects \nrestoration of an effective feedback control of bile acid synthesis and a metabolic equilibrium. In addition, \nblood cholic acid concentration was normal and fat-soluble vitamins were restored to their normal range. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe clinical experience reported in the literature is from a patient population with inborn deficiency of \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase that includes principally \ninfants from the age of one month, children and adolescents. However, absolute numbers of cases are \nsmall. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. \nThis means that due to the rarity of the disease and for ethical reasons it has not been possible to obtain \ncomplete information on this medicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCholic acid, a primary bile acid, is partially absorbed in the ileum. The remaining part is transformed by \nreduction of the 7α-hydroxy group to deoxycholic acid (3α, 12α-dihydroxy) by intestinal bacteria. \nDeoxycholic acid is a secondary bile acid. More than 90% of the primary and secondary bile acids are \nreabsorbed in the ileum by a specific active transporter and are recycled to the liver by the portal vein; the \nremainder is excreted in the faeces. A small fraction of bile acids is excreted in urine. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic study data for Orphacol are available.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe available non-clinical data in the literature reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to \nreproduction. The studies have however not been conducted to the same level of detail as for a \npharmaceutical agent, as cholic acid is a physiological substance in animals and humans. \n \nThe intravenous LD50 of cholic acid in mice is 350 mg/kg body weight. Parenteral administration may \ncause haemolysis and cardiac arrest. Administered orally, bile acids and salts generally have only a minor \ntoxic potential. The oral LD50 in mice is 1520 mg/kg. In repeated-dose studies, frequently reported effects \nof cholic acid have included decreased body weight, diarrhoea and liver damage with elevated \ntransaminases. Increased liver weight and gallstones have been reported in repeated dose studies in which \ncholic acid was co-administered with cholesterol.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nCholic acid showed non-significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed in \nvitro. Animal studies showed that cholic acid did not induce any teratogenic effect or foetal toxicity. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOrphacol 250 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 250 mg of cholic acid. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: Lactose monohydrate (66.98 mg per capsule). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule(capsule). \n \nOblong, opaque, green and white capsule. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOrphacol is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis due to \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in \ninfants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and monitored by an experienced gastroenterologist/hepatologist or a \npaediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist in the case of paediatric patients. \n \nIn case of persistent lack of therapeutic response to cholic acid monotherapy, other treatment options \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). Patients should be monitored as follows: 3-monthly during the first \nyear, 6-monthly during the subsequent three years and annually thereafter (see below). \n \nPosology \nThe dose must be adjusted for each patient in a specialised unit according to blood and/or urine \nchromatographic bile acid profiles. \n \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency \nThe daily dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg in infants, children, adolescents and adults. In all age groups, \nthe minimum dose is 50 mg and the dose is adjusted in 50 mg steps. In adults, the daily dose should not \nexceed 500 mg. \n \nΔ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe daily dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg in infants, children, adolescents and adults. In all age groups, \nthe minimum dose is 50 mg and the dose is adjusted in 50 mg steps. In adults, the daily dose should not \nexceed 500 mg. \n \nThe daily dose may be divided if it consists of more than one capsule  in order to mimic the continuous \nproduction of cholic acid in the body and to reduce the number of capsules that need to be taken per \nadministration.  \n \nDuring the initiation of therapy and dose adjustment, serum and/or urine bile acid levels should be \nmonitored intensively (at least every three months during the first year of treatment, every six months \nduring the second year) using suitable analytical techniques. The concentrations of the abnormal bile acid \nmetabolites synthesised in 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency (3β, 7α-dihydroxy- and \n3β, 7α, 12α-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acids) or in Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency \n(3-oxo-7α-hydroxy- and 3-oxo-7α, l2α-dihydroxy-4-cholenoic acids) should be determined. At each \ninvestigation, the need for dose adjustment should be considered. The lowest dose of cholic acid that \neffectively reduces the bile acid metabolites to as close to zero as possible should be chosen.  \n \nPatients that have previously been treated with other bile acids or other cholic acid preparations should be \nclosely monitored in the same manner during the initiation of treatment with Orphacol. The dose should \nbe adjusted accordingly, as described above.  \n \nLiver parameters should also be monitored, preferentially more frequently than serum and/or urine bile \nacid levels. Concurrent elevation of serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) and/or serum bile acids above normal levels may indicate overdose. Transient elevations of \ntransaminases at the initiation of cholic acid treatment have been observed and do not indicate the need for \na dose reduction if GGT is not elevated and if serum bile acid levels are falling or in the normal range. \n \nAfter the initiation period, serum and/or urine bile acids (using suitable analytical techniques) and liver \nparameters should be determined annually, at a minimum, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Additional \nor more frequent investigations should be undertaken to monitor therapy during periods of fast growth, \nconcomitant disease and pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly population (≥65 years old)  \nThere is no experience in elderly patients. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted individually. \n \nRenal impairment  \nNo data are available for patients with renal impairment. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted \nindividually. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nLimited data are available for patients with minor to severe hepatic impairment related to \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency. \nPatients are expected to present with some degree of hepatic impairment at diagnosis, which improves \nunder cholic acid therapy. The dose of cholic acid should be adjusted individually. \n \nNo experience exists in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency and no \ndose recommendation can be given. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored closely (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia \n\n\n\n12 \n\nPatients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridemia are expected to poorly \nabsorb cholic acid in the intestine. The cholic acid dose for patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia \nwill have to be established and adjusted as described, but an elevated dose, notably higher than the 500 mg \ndaily limit for adult patients, may be required and safe. \n \nPaediatric population \nCholic acid therapy has been used for infants from one month of age, and for children and adolescents. \nThe dose recommendations reflect the use in this population. The daily dose in infants from 1 month to \n2 years of age, children and adolescents ranges from 5 to 15 mg/kg and must be adjusted individually for \neach patient. \n \nMethod of administration \nOrphacol capsules must be taken with food at approximately the same time each day, in the morning \nand/or evening. Administration with food may increase cholic acid bioavailability and improve \ntolerability. Regular and fixed times of administration support the patient’s or caregiver’s compliance. \nCapsules must be swallowed whole with water, without chewing. \nFor infants and children who cannot swallow capsules, the capsules may be opened and the content added \nto infant formula or juice. For additional information, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant use of phenobarbital with cholic acid (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCases of severe hepatotoxicity, including cases with fatal outcome, have been reported, with the use of \ncholic acid. Treatment with cholic acid in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment should be given \nunder close monitoring and, for all patients should be stopped if abnormal hepatocellular function, as \nmeasured by prothrombin time, does not improve within 3 months of the initiation of cholic acid \ntreatment. A concomitant decrease of urine total bile acids should be observed. Treatment should be \nstopped earlier if there are clear indicators of severe hepatic failure. \n \nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia \nPatients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridaemia may have poor \nabsorption of cholic acid from the intestine. The dose of cholic acid in such patients should be established \nand adjusted as described, but an elevated dose, notably higher than the 500 mg daily limit for adult \npatients, may be required”.  \n \nExcipients \nOrphacol capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPhenobarbital antagonises the effect of cholic acid. Use of phenobarbital in patients with \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency treated \nwith cholic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Alternative treatments should be used. \n \nCiclosporin alters the pharmacokinetics of cholic acid by inhibition of the hepatic uptake and \nhepatobiliary secretion of bile acids, as well as its pharmacodynamics by inhibition of cholesterol \n7α-hydroxylase. Co-administration should be avoided. If administration of ciclosporin is considered \n\n\n\n13 \n\nnecessary, serum and urine bile acid levels should be closely monitored and the cholic acid dose adjusted \naccordingly. \n \nBile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) and certain antacids (e.g. aluminium \nhydroxide) bind bile acids and lead to their elimination. Administration of these medicinal products is \nexpected to reduce the effect of cholic acid. The dose of bile acid sequestrants or antacids must be \nseparated from the dose of cholic acid by an interval of 5 hours, regardless of which medicinal product is \nadministered first. \n \nThe effect of food on the bioavailability of cholic acid has not been studied.  There is a theoretical \npossibility that administration with food may increase cholic acid bioavailability and improve tolerability. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nThere is no need for contraceptive measures in women of childbearing potential treated with cholic acid or \ntheir partners. Women of childbearing potential should conduct a pregnancy test as soon as a pregnancy is \nsuspected. \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data (less than 20 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of cholic acid in \npregnant women. The exposed pregnancies showed no adverse reactions to cholic acid and resulted in \nnormal, healthy children. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nIt is extremely important that pregnant women continue their therapy during pregnancy. As a \nprecautionary measure, pregnant women and their unborn children should be closely monitored.  \n \nBreastfeeding \nCholic acid and its metabolites are excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of Orphacol, no \neffects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Orphacol can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo data on the effects of cholic acid on fertility are available. At therapeutic doses, no effect on fertility is \nanticipated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCholic acid has no or neglible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nDue to the rarity of the diseases, the information about the most serious and/or most frequently occurring \nadverse reactions is limited. Diarrhoea, increased transaminases and pruritus have been associated with \noverdosage and disappeared after dose reduction. Development of gallstones associated with long-term \ntreatment have been reported in very limited number of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table lists adverse reactions reported in the literature under treatment with cholic acid. The \nfrequency of these reactions is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea \nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminases increased \n\nGallstones \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions The development of pruritus and/or diarrhoea has been observed \nduring treatment with Orphacol. These reactions abated after dose reduction and are suggestive of \noverdose. Patients presenting with pruritus and/or persistent diarrhoea should be investigated for a \npotential overdose by a serum and/or urine bile acid assay (see section 4.9). \n \nGallstones have been reported after long-term therapy. \n \nPaediatric population The presented safety information is derived principally from paediatric patients. The \navailable literature is not sufficient to detect a difference in the safety of cholic acid within paediatric age \ngroups or between paediatric patients and adults. \n \nOther special populations \nPlease refer to section 4.2 for use of Orphacol in special populations. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEpisodes of symptomatic overdose have been reported, including accidental overdose. Clinical features \nwere limited to pruritus and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed elevation of serum gamma \nglutamyltransferase (GGT) transaminases and serum bile acid concentrations. Reduction of the dose led to \nresolution of the clinical signs and correction of abnormal laboratory parameters. \n \nIn the case of an accidental overdose, treatment should be continued at the recommended dose after \nnormalisation of clinical signs and/or biological abnormalities. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Bile and liver therapy, bile acid and derivatives, ATC code: A05AA03  \n \nCholic acid is the predominant primary bile acid in man. In patients with inborn deficiency of \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase and Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase, the biosynthesis of primary \nbile acids is reduced or absent. Both inborn diseases are extremely rare, with a prevalence in Europe of \nabout 3 to 5 patients with 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency per 10 million \ninhabitants, and an estimated ten-fold lower prevalence for Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency. In \nthe absence of treatment, unphysiologic cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile acid metabolites are predominant \nin the liver, serum and urine. The rational basis for treatment consists of restoration of the bile acid-\ndependent component of bile flow enabling restoration of biliary secretion and biliary elimination of toxic \nmetabolites; inhibition of the production of the toxic bile acid metabolites by negative feedback on \ncholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis; and improvement of \nthe patient’s nutritional status by correcting intestinal malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\n \nClinical experience has been reported in the literature from small cohorts of patients and single case \nreports; absolute patient numbers are small due to the rarity of the conditions. This rarity also made the \nconduct of controlled clinical studies impossible. Overall, cholic acid treatment results for about 60 \npatients with 3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency are reported in the literature. Detailed \nlong-term data on treatment with cholic acid monotherapy are available for 14 patients observed for up to \n12.9 years. Cholic acid treatment results for seven patients with Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency \nfor up to 14 years are reported in the literature. Detailed medium- to long-term data are available for 5 of \nthese patients, of whom 1 has been treated with cholic acid monotherapy. Oral cholic acid therapy has \nbeen shown to: postpone or obviate the need for liver transplantation; restore normal laboratory \nparameters; improve histological lesions of the liver, and significantly improve all of the patient’s \nsymptoms. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine during cholic acid therapy shows the presence of cholic \nacid and a marked reduction, or even complete elimination of the toxic bile acid metabolites. This reflects \nrestoration of an effective feedback control of bile acid synthesis and a metabolic equilibrium. In addition, \nblood cholic acid concentration was normal and fat-soluble vitamins were restored to their normal range. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe clinical experience reported in the literature is from a patient population with inborn deficiency of \n3β-Hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase or Δ4-3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase that includes principally \ninfants from the age of one month, children and adolescents. However, absolute numbers of cases are \nsmall. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. \nThis means that due to the rarity of the disease and for ethical reasons it has not been possible to obtain \ncomplete information on this medicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCholic acid, a primary bile acid, is partially absorbed in the ileum.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nOrphacol 50 mg hard capsules \nOrphacol 250 mg hard capsules \n\nCholic acid \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains  \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Orphacol is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Orphacol \n3. How to take Orphacol \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Orphacol \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Orphacol is and what it is used for \n \nOrphacol contains cholic acid, a bile acid which is normally produced by the liver. Certain medical \nconditions are caused by defects in bile acid production and Orphacol is used to treat infants from one \nmonth to 2 years of age, children, adolescents and adults with these medical conditions. The cholic acid \ncontained in Orphacol replaces the bile acids that are missing due to the defect in bile acid production. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Orphacol \n \nDo not take Orphacol \n- if you are allergic to cholic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are taking phenobarbital, a medicine to treat epilepsy. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nDuring your treatment, your doctor will carry out various blood and urine tests at different time to see how \nyour body is handling this medicine and to help work out the dose that you need. More frequent tests will \nbe needed if you are growing fast, if you are ill (if you have e.g. liver problems), or if you are pregnant. \n \nOther medicines and Orphacol \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken any or might take other medicines. \n \nSome medicines used to lower cholesterol levels, so-called bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, \ncolestipol, colesevelam), and medicines to treat heartburn that contain aluminium may lessen the effect of \n\n\n\n33 \n\nOrphacol. If you take these medicines, take Orphacol at least 5 hours before or at least 5 hours after taking \nthese other medicines.  \nCiclosporin (a medicine used to suppress the immune system) may also change the effect of Orphacol. \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking ciclosporin. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPlease consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. Take a pregnancy test as soon as you suspect \nyou may be pregnant. It is very important to continue taking Orphacol during pregnancy. \n \nIf you become pregnant during treatment with Orphacol, your doctor will decide which treatment and dose \nis best in your situation. As a precaution, you and your unborn child should be closely monitored during \npregnancy. \n \nOrphacol can be used during breast-feeding. Tell your doctor if you plan to breast-feed or are breast-\nfeeding before you take Orphacol. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOrphacol is not expected to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nOrphacol contains lactose \nOrphacol contains a certain sugar (lactose monohydrate). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Orphacol. \n \n \n3. How to take Orphacol \n \nAlways take Orphacol exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe usual starting dose is 5 to 15 mg per kilogram body weight every day in infants, children, adolescents \nand adults. \n \nBefore treatment your doctor will make an assessment from your laboratory tests to determine the correct \ndose for you. The dose will then be further adjusted by your doctor depending on your body’s response.  \n \nOrphacol capsules are taken by mouth with a meal at approximately the same time each day, in the \nmorning and/or evening. Taking Orphacol at regular times with a meal will help you remember to take \nthis medicine, and may help your body to better take it up. Capsules must be swallowed whole with water. \nDo not chew. \n \nIf your doctor has prescribed a dose which requires you to take more than one capsule per day, you and \nyour doctor can decide how this will be taken during the day. You may for example take one capsule in \nthe morning and one in the evening. This way, you will have to take fewer capsules at once.  \n \nUse in children \nFor babies and children who cannot swallow capsules, the capsule can be opened and its contents added to \nbaby formula or apple/orange or apple/apricot juice adapted for small children. \n \nIf you take more Orphacol than you should \nIf you have taken more Orphacol than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible. He will assess \nyour laboratory test results and advise you when you should resume your treatment with your normal \ndose. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nIf you forget to take Orphacol \nTake your next dose when you would normally take it. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Orphacol \nThere is a risk of permanently damaging your liver if you stop taking Orphacol. You should never stop \ntaking Orphacol unless your doctor advises you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSeveral patients have experienced itching and/or diarrhoea, however, it is not known how likely this is to \noccur (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). If itching and/or diarrhoea last for more \nthan three days, tell your doctor. \n \nFor several patients an increase of liver enzymes (serum transaminases) have been reported during the \ntreatment with Orphacol (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Your doctor will decide \nwhat to do if this happens to you. \n \nGallstones have been reported after long-term therapy with Orphacol. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By \nreporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Orphacol \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Orphacol after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and blister after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore below 30°C. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wasterwater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
