This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLEMTRADA 12 mg concentrate for solution for infusion  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 12 mg alemtuzumab in 1.2 ml (10 mg/ml). \n \nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody produced in mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) suspension \nculture in a nutrient medium by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘potassium- \nfree’. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium- free’. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nA clear, colourless to slightly yellow concentrate with pH 7.0 – 7.4. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nLEMTRADA is indicated  as a single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing \nremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: \n Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one \n\ndisease modifying therapy (DMT) or \n Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more \n\ndisabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a \nsignificant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nLEMTRADA treatment should only be initiated and supervised by a neurologist experienced in the treatment \nof patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in a hospital with ready access to intensive care. Specialists and \nequipment required for the timely diagnosis and management of adverse reactions, especially myocardial \nischaemia and myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, autoimmune conditions, and \ninfections, should be available.   \n \nResources for the management of cytokine release syndrome, hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions \nshould be available. \n \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Patient Alert Card and Patient Guide and be informed \nabout the risks of LEMTRADA (see also package leaflet). \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nPosology  \n \nThe recommended dose of alemtuzumab is 12 mg/day administered by intravenous infusion for 2 initial \ntreatment courses, with up to 2 additional treatment courses if needed. \n \nInitial treatment of 2 courses: \n First treatment course: 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days (60 mg total dose) \n Second treatment course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered 12 months \n\nafter the first treatment course. \nUp to two additional treatment courses, as needed, may be considered (see section 5.1): \n Third or fourth course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered at least \n\n12 months after the prior treatment course (see section 4.1, 5.1). \n \nMissed doses should not be given on the same day as a scheduled dose.  \n \nFollow-up of patients  \nThe therapy is recommended as an initial treatment of 2 courses with up to 2 additional treatment courses if \nneeded (see posology) with safety follow-up of patients from initiation of the first treatment course and for at \nleast 48 months after the last infusion of the second treatment course. If an additional third or fourth course is \nadministered, continue safety follow-up for at least 48 months after the last infusion (see section 4.4). \n \nPre-treatment \nPatients should be pre-treated with corticosteroids immediately prior to LEMTRADA administration on each \nof the first 3 days of any treatment course. In clinical trials, patients were pre-treated with 1,000 mg \nmethylprednisolone for the first 3 days of each LEMTRADA treatment course. \n \nPretreatment with antihistamines and/or antipyretics prior to LEMTRADA administration may also be \nconsidered. \n \nOral prophylaxis for herpes infection should be administered to all patients starting on the first day of each \ntreatment course and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following treatment with LEMTRADA (see also \nunder ‘Infections’ in section 4.4). In clinical trials, patients were administered aciclovir 200 mg twice a day \nor equivalent. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nClinical studies did not include any patients aged over 61 years old. It has not been determined whether they \nrespond differently than younger patients. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment  \nLEMTRADA has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in children with MS aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. There is no relevant use of alemtuzumab in children aged from birth to less than 10 years for the \ntreatment of multiple sclerosis. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nLEMTRADA must be diluted before infusion. The diluted solution should be administered by intravenous \ninfusion over a period of approximately 4 hours. \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. \n \nPatients with severe active infection until complete resolution. \n \nPatients with uncontrolled hypertension. \n \nPatients with a history of arterial dissection of the cervicocephalic arteries. \n \nPatients with a history of stroke.  \n \nPatients with a history of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. \n \nPatients with known coagulopathy, on anti-platelet or anti-coagulant therapy. \n \nPatients with other concomitant autoimmune diseases (besides MS).  \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nLEMTRADA is not recommended for patients with inactive disease or those stable on current therapy. \n \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Package Leaflet, the Patient Alert Card and the Patient \nGuide. Before treatment, patients must be informed about the risks and benefits, and the need to commit to \nfollow-up from treatment initiation until at least 48 months after the last infusion of the second LEMTRADA \ntreatment course. If an additional course is administered, safety-follow up should be continued until at least \n48 months after the last infusion.  \n \nAutoimmunity \n \nTreatment may result in the formation of autoantibodies and increase the risk of autoimmune mediated \nconditions which may be serious and life threatening. Reported autoimmune conditions, include thyroid \ndisorders, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),  nephropathies (e.g. anti-glomerular basement \nmembrane disease), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and acquired haemophilia A. In the post-marketing setting, \npatients developing multiple autoimmune disorders after LEMTRADA treatment have been observed. \nPatients who develop autoimmunity should be assessed for other autoimmune mediated conditions (see \nsection 4.3). Patients and physicians should be made aware of the potential later onset of autoimmune \ndisorders after the 48 months monitoring period. \n \nAcquired haemophilia A \nCases of acquired haemophilia A (anti-factor VIII antibodies) have been reported in both clinical trial and \npost-marketing setting. Patients typically present with spontaneous subcutaneous haematomas and extensive \nbruising although haematuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal or other types of bleeding may occur. A \ncoagulopathy panel including aPTT must be obtained in all patients that present with such symptoms. In case \nof a prolonged aPTT patient should be referred to a haematologist. Educate patients on the signs and \nsymptoms of acquired haemophilia A and to seek immediate medical attention, if any of these symptoms are \nobserved. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nImmune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) \nSerious events of ITP have been observed in 12 (1%) patients treated in controlled clinical trials in MS \n(corresponding to an annualised rate 4.7 events/1000 patient years). An additional 12 serious events of ITP \nhas been observed through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up (cumulative annualised \nrate of 2.8 events/1000 patient years). One patient developed ITP that went unrecognised prior to \nimplementation of monthly blood monitoring requirements and died from intracerebral haemorrhage. In \n79.5% of cases, ITP onset occurred within 4 years after first exposure. However, in some cases ITP \ndeveloped years later. Symptoms of ITP could include (but are not limited to) easy bruising, petechiae, \nspontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, haemoptysis), heavier than normal or irregular \nmenstrual bleeding. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of anti-GBM disease (see below), and an \nappropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. Remind the patient to remain vigilant for symptoms \nthey may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. \n \nComplete blood counts with differential should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly \nintervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. After this period of time, testing should be \nperformed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP is suspected a complete blood count should be \nobtained immediately. \n \nIf ITP onset is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including \nimmediate referral to a specialist. Data from clinical trials in MS has shown that adherence to the blood \nmonitoring requirements and education relative to signs and symptoms of ITP has led to early detection and \ntreatment of ITP with most cases responding to first-line medical therapy. \n \nNephropathies \nNephropathies, including anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, have been observed in \n6  (0.4%) patients in clinical trials in MS through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up \nand generally occurred within 39 months following the last administration of LEMTRADA. In clinical trials, \nthere were 2 cases of anti-GBM disease. Both cases were serious, were identified early through clinical and \nlaboratory monitoring, and had a positive outcome after treatment. \n \nClinical manifestations of nephropathy may include elevation in serum creatinine, haematuria, and/or \nproteinuria. While not observed in clinical trials, alveolar haemorrhage manifested as haemoptysis may occur \nwith anti-GBM disease. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of ITP or acquired haemophilia A (see above), \nand an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. The patient should be reminded to remain \nvigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. \nAnti-GBM disease may lead to renal failure requiring dialysis and/or transplantation if not treated rapidly \nand can be life-threatening if left untreated. \n \nSerum creatinine levels should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter \nuntil at least 48 months after the last infusion. Urinalysis with microscopy should be obtained prior to \ninitiation and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. The observation \nof clinically significant changes from baseline in serum creatinine, unexplained haematuria, and/or \nproteinuria, should prompt further evaluation for nephropathies including immediate referral to a specialist. \nEarly detection and treatment of nephropathies may decrease the risk of poor outcomes. After this period of \ntime, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of nephropathies. \n \nThyroid disorders \nThyroid endocrine disorders including autoimmune thyroid disorders have been observed in 36.8% of \npatients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in clinical trials in MS with a median of 6.1 years (maximum \n12 years) of follow- up from the first LEMTRADA exposure. The incidence of thyroid events was higher in \npatients with a medical history of thyroid disorders both in the LEMTRADA and interferon beta 1a (IFNB-\n1a) treatment groups. Observed autoimmune thyroid disorders included hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. \nMost events were mild to moderate in severity. Serious endocrine events occurred in 4.4% of patients, with \nBasedow’s disease (also known as Graves’ disease), hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune \nthyroiditis, and goitre occurring in more than 1 patient. Most thyroid events were managed with conventional \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nmedical therapy however some patients required surgical intervention.  In the post-marketing setting several \npatients who developed biopsy proven AIH had previously developed autoimmune thyroid disorders. \n \nThyroid function tests, such as thyroid stimulating hormone levels, should be obtained prior to initiation of \ntreatment and every 3 months thereafter until 48 months following the last infusion. After this period of time \ntesting should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of thyroid dysfunction or in case of \npregnancy. \n \nThyroid disease poses special risks in women who are pregnant (see section 4.6). \n \nIn clinical trials, 74% of patients with positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies at baseline \ndeveloped a thyroid event compared with 38% of patients with a baseline negative status. The vast majority \n(approximately 80%) of patients who presented with a thyroid event after treatment were anti-TPO antibody \nnegative at baseline. Therefore, regardless of pretreatment anti-TPO antibody status patients may develop a \nthyroid adverse reaction and must have all tests periodically performed as described above. \n \nCytopenias \nSuspected autoimmune cytopenias such as neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and pancytopenia have been \ninfrequently reported in clinical trials in MS. Complete blood count results (see above under ITP) should be \nused to monitor for cytopenias, including neutropenia. If a cytopenia is confirmed, appropriate medical \nintervention should be promptly initiated, including referral to a specialist. \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis and hepatic injury  \nCases of autoimmune hepatitis (including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation) and hepatic \ninjury related to infections have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA (see section 4.3). Liver \nfunction tests should beperformed before initial treatment and at monthly intervals until at least 48 months \nafter the last infusion. Patients should be informed about the risk of autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic injury and \nrelated symptoms.  \n \nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) \n \nDuring post-marketing use, HLH (including fatal cases) has been reported in patients treated with \nLEMTRADA. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical \nsigns and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterized by fever, hepatomegaly and \ncytopenias. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Symptoms have been \nreported to occur within a few months to four years following the initiation of treatment. Patients should be \ninformed about symptoms of HLH and time to onset. Patients who develop early manifestations of \npathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be \nconsidered. \n \nInfusion-associated Reactions (IARs)  \n \nIn clinical trials, infusion associated reactions (IARs) were defined as any adverse event occurring during or \nwithin 24 hours of LEMTRADA infusion. The majority of these may be due to cytokine release during \ninfusion. Most patients treated with LEMTRADA in clinical trials in MS experienced mild to moderate IARs \nduring and/or up to 24 hours after LEMTRADA 12 mg administration. The incidence of IARs was higher in \ncourse 1 than in subsequent courses. Through all available follow-up, including patients who received \nadditional treatment courses, the most common IARs included headache, rash, pyrexia, nausea, urticaria, \npruritus, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, dyspnoea, dysgeusia, chest discomfort, generalised rash, \ntachycardia, bradycardia, dyspepsia, dizziness, and pain. Serious reactions occurred in 3% of patients and \nincluded cases of headache, pyrexia, urticaria, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, nausea, chest discomfort, and \nhypotension. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of infusion \nassociated reactions, but would tend to be more severe or potentially life-threatening. Reactions attributed to \nanaphylaxis have been reported rarely in contrast to infusion associated reactions.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nIt is recommended that patients be premedicated to ameliorate the effects of infusion reactions (see section \n4.2). \n \nMost patients in controlled clinical trials received antihistamines and/or antipyretics before at least one \nLEMTRADA infusion. IARs may occur in patients despite pretreatment. Observation for infusion reactions \nis recommended during and for at least 2 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Extended observation time  \n(hospitalization) should be considered, as appropriate. If severe infusion reactions occur, the intravenous \ninfusion should be discontinued immediately. Resources for the management of anaphylaxis or serious \nreactions (see below) should be available. \n \nOther serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion \n \nDuring post-marketing use, rare, serious, sometimes fatal and unpredictable adverse events from various \norgan systems have been reported. In the majority of cases time to onset was within 1-3 days of the \nLEMTRADA infusion. Reactions have occurred following any of the doses and also after course number 2.  \nPatients should be informed about the signs and symptoms and on the time to onset of the events. Patients \nshould be advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur and be informed on \nthe potential for delayed onset.  \n \nHaemorrhagic stroke \nSeveral of the patient reported were below 50 years of age and had no history of hypertension, bleeding \ndisorders or concomitant anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. In some patients there was increased blood \npressure from baseline before the haemorrhage. \n \nMyocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction \nSeveral of the patients reported were below 40 years of age and had no risk factors for ischemic heart \ndisease. It was noted that in some of the patients, blood pressure and /or heart rate was temporarily abnormal \nduring the infusion. \n \nDissection of the cervicocephalic arteries \nCases of cervicocephalic arterial dissections, including multiple dissections, have been reported both within \nthe first days after the LEMTRADA infusion or later on within the first month after the infusion. \n \nPulmonary alveolar haemorrhage \nReported cases of temporally associated events were not related to anti-GBM disease (Goodpasteurs \nsyndrome).  \n \nThrombocytopenia \nThe reported thrombocytopenia occurred within the first days after the infusion (unlike ITP). It was often \nself-limiting and relatively mild, although severity and outcome was unknown in many cases. \n \nPericarditis  \nRare cases of pericarditis, pericardial effusion and other pericardial events have been reported, both as part \nof acute infusion reaction and with later onset.  \n \nInfusion instructions to reduce serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion \n\n Pre-infusion evaluations:  \no Obtain a baseline ECG and vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure measurement.  \no Perform laboratory tests (complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases, \n\nserum creatinine, test of thyroid function and urinanalysis with microscopy). \n During infusion:  \n\no Perform continuous/frequent (at least every hour) monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure \nand overall clinical status of the patients  \n Discontinue the infusion  \n\n In case of a severe adverse event \n If the patient shows clinical symptoms suggesting development of a serious \n\nadverse event associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nhemorrhagic stroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary \nalveolar haemorrhage \n\n Post-infusion:  \no Observation for infusion reactions is recommended for a minimum of 2 hours after \n\nLEMTRADA infusion. Patients with clinical symtoms suggesting development of a serious \nadverse event temporarily associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, haemorrhagic \nstroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage) should be \nclosely monitored until complete resolution of the symptoms. The observation time should \nbe extended (hospitalisation) as appropriate. The patients should be educated on the potential \nfor delayed onset of infusion associated reactions and instructed to report symptoms and \nseek appropriate medical care.  \n\no Platelet count should be obtained immediately after infusion on Days 3 and 5 of the first \ninfusion course, as well as immediately after infusion on Day 3 of any subsequent course. \nClinically significant thrombocytopenia needs to be followed until resolution. Referral to a \nhaematologist for management should be considered. \n\n \nInfections \n \nInfections occurred in 71% of patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg as compared to 53% of patients \ntreated with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a [IFNB 1a](44mcg 3-times weekly) in controlled clinical trials in \nMS up to 2 years in duration and were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Infections that occurred \nmore often in LEMTRADA –treated patients than IFNB 1a patients included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract \ninfection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, oral herpes, influenza, and bronchitis. Serious infections \noccurred in 2.7% of patients treated with LEMTRADA as compared to 1% of patients treated with IFNB-1a \nin controlled clinical trials in MS. Serious infections in the LEMTRADA group included: appendicitis, \ngastroenteritis, pneumonia, herpes zoster, and tooth infection. Infections were generally of typical duration \nand resolved following conventional medical treatment.  \n \nThe cumulative annualised rate of infections was 0.99 through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of \nfollow-up from the first LEMTRADA exposure, as compared to 1.27 in controlled clinical trials.  \n \nSerious varicella zoster virus infections, including primary varicella and varicella zoster re-activation, have \noccurred more often in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (0.4%) in clinical trials as compared to \nIFNB-1a (0%). Cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including cervical dysplasia and anogenital \nwarts, has also been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (2%). It is recommended that HPV \nscreening be completed annually for female patients. \n \nCytomegalovirus infections (CMV) including cases of CMV reactivation have been reported in \nLEMTRADA-treated patients. Most cases occurred within 2 months of alemtuzumab dosing. Before \ninitiation of therapy, evaluation of immune serostatus could be considered according to local guidelines. \n \nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, including severe EBV hepatitis cases, has been reported in \nLEMTRADA-treated patients. \n \nTuberculosis has been reported for patients treated with LEMTRADA and IFNB-1a in controlled clinical \ntrials. Active and latent tuberculosis, including a few cases of disseminated tuberculosis,  have been reported \nin 0.3% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA, most often in endemic regions. Before initiation of \ntherapy, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis infection, according \nto local guidelines. \n \nListeriosis/Listeria meningitis has been reported in LEMTRADA treated patients, generally within one \nmonth of LEMTRADA infusion. To reduce the risk of infection, patients receiving LEMTRADA should \navoid ingestion of uncooked or undercooked meats, soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks \nprior to, during, and for at least one month after LEMTRADA infusion.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nSuperficial fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis, occurred more commonly in \nLEMTRADA –treated patients (12%) than in patients treated with IFNB-1a (3%) in controlled clinical trials \nin MS. \n \nPneumonitis has been reported in patients who received LEMTRADA infusions. Most cases occurred within \nthe first month after treatment with LEMTRADA. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of \npneumonitis, which may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness and \nhemoptysis.  \n \nInitiation of treatment with LEMTRADA should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until \nresolution. Patients receiving LEMTRADA should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a \nphysician. \n \nProphylaxis with an oral anti-herpes agent should be initiated starting on the first day of LEMTRADA \ntreatment and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following each course of treatment. In clinical trials \npatients were administered cyclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. \n \nLEMTRADA has not been administered for treatment of MS concomitantly with or following antineoplastic \nor immunosuppressive therapies. As with other immunomodulating therapies, potential combined effects on \nthe patient’s immune system should be taken into account when considering administration of LEMTRADA. \nConcomitant use of LEMTRADA with any of these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. \n \nNo data are available on the association of LEMTRADA with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus \n(HCV) reactivation as patients with evidence of active or chronic infections were excluded from clinical \ntrials. Screening patients at high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before initiation of LEMTRADA should \nbe considered and caution should be exercised in prescribing LEMTRADA to patients identified as carriers \nof HBV and/or HCV as these patients may be at risk of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential virus \nreactivation as a consequence of their pre-existing status. \n \nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nRare cases of PML (including fatal), have been reported in MS patients after treatment with alemtuzumab. \nPatients treated with alemtuzumab must be monitored for any signs that may be suggestive of PML. Risk \nfactors of special importance include previous immunosuppressive treatment, in particular other MS \ntreatments with known risk of causing PML.  \n \nMRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Prior to initiation and readministration of \nalemtuzumab treatment, MRI scan should be made and evaluated for signs that are consistent with PML. \nFurther evaluation, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological \nassessments should be performed as appropriate. The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms \nsuggestive of PML that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). \nPatients should also be advised to inform their relatives or caregivers about their treatment, since they may \nnotice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. PML should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any \nMS patient taking alemtuzumab presenting with neurological symptoms and/or new brain lesions in MRI. \n \nIf a diagnosis of PML has been made, treatment with alemtuzumab should not be started or restarted.  \n \nAcute acalculous cholecystitis  \n \nLEMTRADA may increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis. In controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of \nLEMTRADA-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients \ntreated with INFB-1a. During post-marketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have \nbeen reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Time to onset of symptoms ranged from less than 24 hours to \n2 months after LEMTRADA infusion. Most patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics and \nrecovered without surgical intervention, whereas others underwent cholecystectomy. Symptoms of acute \nacalculous cholecystitis include abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Acute \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nacalculous cholecystitis is a condition that may be associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not \ndiagnosed early and treated. If acute acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, evaluate and treat promptly. \n \nMalignancy \n \nAs with other immunomodulatory therapies, caution should be exercised in initiating LEMTRADA therapy \nin patients with pre-existing and/or an on-going malignancy. It is not currently known if LEMTRADA \nconfers a higher risk for developing thyroid malignancies, since thyroid autoimmunity may itself be a risk \nfactor for thyroid malignancies. \n \nContraception \n \nPlacental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of LEMTRADA were observed in mice during \ngestation and following delivery. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive \nmeasures during treatment and for 4 months following a course of LEMTRADA treatment (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nVaccines \n \nIt is recommended that patients have completed local immunisation requirements at least 6 weeks prior to \ntreatment with LEMTRADA. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following \nLEMTRADA treatment has not been studied. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following a course of LEMTRADA treatment has not \nbeen formally studied in controlled clinical trials in MS and should not be administered to MS patients who \nhave recently received a course of LEMTRADA.  \n \nVaricella zoster virus antibody testing/vaccination \nAs for any immune modulating medicinal product, before initiating a course of LEMTRADA treatment, \npatients without a history of chickenpox or without vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should \nbe tested for antibodies to VZV. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients should be considered prior \nto treatment initiation with LEMTRADA. To allow for the full effect of the VZV vaccination to occur, \ntreatment with LEMTRADA should be postponed for 6 weeks following vaccination. \n \nRecommended laboratory tests for monitoring patients \n \nClinical examination and laboratory tests should be conducted at periodic intervals until at least 48 months \nfollowing the last treatment course of LEMTRADA in order to monitor for early signs of autoimmune \ndiseases: \n Complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases and serum creatinine levels (prior to \n\ntreatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter). \n Urinalysis with microscopy (prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter)  \n A test of thyroid function, such as thyroid stimulating hormone level (prior to treatment initiation and \n\nevery 3 months thereafter). \n \nInformation from use of alemtuzumab prior to the marketing authorisation of LEMTRADA outside of \ncompany-sponsored studies  \n \nThe following adverse reactions were identified prior to registration of LEMTRADA during use of \nalemtuzumab for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), as well as for the \ntreatment of other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses (e.g. 30 mg) than that \nrecommended in the treatment of MS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of \nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship \nto alemtuzumab exposure. \n \nAutoimmune disease \nAutoimmune events reported in alemtuzumab-treated patients include neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia \n(including a fatal case), acquired haemophilia, anti-GBM disease, and thyroid disease. Serious and \nsometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena including autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune \nthrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyradiculoneuropathy have been reported in alemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients. A positive Coombs \ntest has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient. A fatal event of transfusion associated \ngraft versus host disease has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient.  \n \nInfusion-associated reactions \nSerious and sometimes fatal IARs including bronchospasm, hypoxia, syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome , respiratory arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, acute cardiac \ninsufficiency, and cardiac arrest have been observed in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher \nand more frequent doses than used in MS. Severe anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions, including \nanaphylactic shock and angioedema have also been reported.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nInfections and infestations \nSerious and sometimes fatal viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal infections, including those due to \nreactivation of latent infections, have been reported in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher \nand more frequent doses than used in MS.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nSevere bleeding reactions have been reported in non-MS patients. \n \nCardiac disorders \nCongestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and decreased ejection fraction have been reported in \nalemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients previously treated with potentially cardiotoxic agents. \n \nEpstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders \nEpstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been observed outside company-sponsored \nstudies. \n  \nLEMTRADA contains sodium and potassium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘potassium- \nfree’. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with LEMTRADA using the recommended dose in \npatients with MS. In a controlled clinical trial in MS patients recently treated with beta interferon and \nglatiramer acetate were required to discontinue treatment 28 days before initiating treatment with \nLEMTRADA. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSerum concentrations were low or undetectable within approximately 30 days following each treatment \ncourse. Therefore, women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception when receiving a \ncourse of treatment with LEMTRADA and up to 4 months after each course of treatment.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of alemtuzumab in pregnant women. LEMTRADA should be \nadministered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nHuman IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; alemtuzumab may cross the placental barrier as well and \nthus potentially pose a risk to the foetus. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nIt is not known whether alemtuzumab can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women or \nwhether it can affect reproductive capacity. \n \nThyroid disease (see section 4.4 Thyroid Disorders) poses special risks in women who are pregnant. Without \ntreatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy, there is an increased risk for miscarriage and foetal effects \nsuch as mental retardation and dwarfism. In mothers with Graves’ disease, maternal thyroid stimulating \nhormone receptor antibodies can be transferred to a developing foetus and can cause transient neonatal \nGraves’ disease. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nAlemtuzumab was detected in the milk and offspring of lactating female mice. \n \nIt is unknown whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling newborn/infant cannot \nbe excluded. Therefore, breast-feeding should be discontinued during each course of treatment with \nLEMTRADA and for 4 months following the last infusion of each treatment course. However, benefits of \nconferred immunity through breast-milk may outweigh the risks of potential exposure to alemtuzumab for \nthe suckling newborn/infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are no adequate clinical safety data on the effect of LEMTRADA on fertility. In a sub-study in 13 \nmale LEMTRADA-treated patients (treated with either 12 mg or 24 mg), there was no evidence of aspermia, \nazoospermia, consistently depressed sperm count, motility disorders or an increase in sperm morphological \nabnormalities.  \n \nCD52 is known to be present in human and rodent reproductive tissues. Animal data have shown effects on \nfertility in humanised mice (see section 5.3), however a potential impact on human fertility during the period \nof exposure is unknown based on the available data. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nLEMTRADA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Most patients experience IARs \nwhich occur during or within 24 hours after treatment with LEMTRADA. Some of the IARs (e.g. dizziness) \ncould temporarily impact the patient's ability to drive or use machines and caution should be exercised until \nthese are resolved.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile in clinical studies \n \nA total of 1,486 patients treated with LEMTRADA (12 mg or 24 mg) constituted the safety population in a \npooled analysis of MS clinical studies with a median follow-up of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years), resulting \nin 8,635 patient-years of safety follow-up. \n \nThe most important adverse reactions are autoimmunity (ITP, thyroid disorders, nephropathies, cytopenias), \nIARs, and infections. These are described in section 4.4. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions with LEMTRADA (in ≥20% of patients) were rash, headache, pyrexia, \nand respiratory tract infections. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below is based on the pooled safety data on all LEMTRADA 12 mg-treated patients during all \navailable follow up in clinical trials. Adverse reactions are listed by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory \nActivities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Frequencies are defined \naccording to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions have been presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions in study 1, 2, 3 and 4 observed in

Table 1 include adverse reactions reported as Infusion Associated \nReactions.  \n \nTerms marked with two asterisks (**) in Table 1 include adverse reactions observed in the post marketing \nsetting which have occurred in the majority of cases with time to onset within 1-3 days of LEMTRADA \ninfusion, following any of the doses during the treatment course. \n \nNeutropenia \nCases of severe (including fatal) neutropenia have been reported within 2 months of LEMTRADA infusion. \n \nSafety profile in long-term follow-up \n \nThe type of adverse reactions including seriousness and severity observed in LEMTRADA treatment groups \nthrough all available follow-up including patients who received additional treatment courses were similar to \nthose in the active-controlled studies. The incidence of IARs was higher in course 1 than in subsequent \ncourses. \n \nIn patients continuing from controlled clinical studies and who did not receive any additional LEMTRADA \nafter the initial 2 treatment courses, the rate (events per person-year) of most adverse reactions was \ncomparable to or reduced in years 3-6 as compared to years 1 and 2. The rate of thyroid adverse reactions \nwas highest in year three and declined thereafter.  \n\nincluding anti-\nGBM disease \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n Menorrhagia, \nmenstruation \nirregular \n\nCervical \ndysplasia, \namenorrhoea \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nPyrexia*, \nfatigue*, chills*  \n\nChest \ndiscomfort*, \npain*, oedema \nperipheral, \nasthenia, \ninfluenza-like \nillness, malaise, \ninfusion site pain \n\n   \n\nInvestigations  Blood creatinine \nincreased \n\nWeight \ndecreased, \nweight increased, \nred blood cell \ncount decreased, \nbacterial test \npositive, blood \nglucose \nincreased, mean \ncell volume \nincrease \n\n  \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Contusion, \ninfusion related \nreaction \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nIn controlled clinical trials two MS patients accidentally received up to 60 mg LEMTRADA (i.e. total dose \nfor initial treatment course) in a single infusion and experienced serious reactions (headache, rash, and either \nhypotension or sinus tachycardia). Doses of LEMTRADA greater than those tested in clinical studies may \nincrease the intensity and/or duration of infusion-associated adverse reactions or its immune effects. \n \nThere is no known antidote for alemtuzumab over dosage. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the \nmedicinal product and supportive therapy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA34  \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nAlemtuzumab, is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody directed against the 21-28 \nkD cell surface glycoprotein CD52. Alemtuzumab is an IgG1 kappa antibody with human variable \nframework and constant regions, and complementary-determining regions from a murine (rat) monoclonal \nantibody. The antibody has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kD.  \n \nAlemtuzumab binds to CD52, a cell surface antigen present at high levels on T (CD3+) and B (CD19+) \nlymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages. There is little or no \nCD52 detected on neutrophils, plasma cells, or bone marrow stem cells. Alemtuzumab acts through \nantibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis following cell surface binding to T \nand B lymphocytes.  \n \nThe mechanism by which LEMTRADA exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not fully elucidated. However, \nresearch suggests immunomodulatory effects through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes, \nincluding: \n \n- Alterations in the number, proportions, and properties of some lymphocyte subsets post-treatment \n- Increased representation of regulatory T cell subsets \n- Increased representation of memory T- and B-lymphocytes \n- Transient effects on components of innate immunity (i.e., neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells) \n \nThe reduction in the level of circulating B and T cells by LEMTRADA and subsequent repopulation, may \nreduce the potential for relapse, which ultimately delays disease progression. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nLEMTRADA depletes circulating T and B lymphocytes after each treatment course with the lowest observed \nvalues occurring 1 month after a course of treatment (the earliest post-treatment time point in phase 3 \nstudies). Lymphocytes repopulate over time with B-cell recovery usually completed within 6 months. CD3+ \nand CD4+ lymphocyte counts rise more slowly towards normal, but generally do not return to baseline by 12-\nmonths post-treatment.

The study was declared successful if at least one of the two co-\nprimary endpoint was met. \n\n2 CDW was defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) from a \nbaseline EDSS score ≥1.0 (1.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 0) that was sustained for \n6 months. \n\n3 Estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \nRelapse severity \nIn alignment with the effect on relapse rate, supportive analyses from Study 1 (CAMMS323) showed that \nLEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe \nrelapses (61% reduction, p=0.0056) and signficantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (58% \nreduction, p<0.0001) compared to IFNB-1a.  \nSupportive analyses from Study 2 (CAMMS32400507) showed that LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to \nsignificantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe relapses (48% reduction, p=0.0121), \nand significantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (56% reduction, p<0.0001) or to hospitalization \n(55% reduction, p=0.0045) compared to IFNB-1a. \n \nConfirmed disability improvement (CDI) \nTime to onset of CDI was defined as a decrease of at least one point on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS \nscore ≥ 2 that was sustained for at least 6 months. CDI is a measure for sustained disability improvement. \n29% of patients treated with LEMTRADA reached CDI in Study 2, while only 13% of subcutaneous IFNB-\n1a treated patiets reached this endpoint. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0002). \n \nStudy 3 (phase 2 study CAMMS223) evaluated the safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in patients with \nRRMS over the course of 3 years. Patients had an EDSS from 0-3.0, at least 2 clinical episodes of MS in the \nprior 2 years, and ≥1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion at study entry. Patients had not received prior therapy for \nMS. Patients were treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day (N=108) or 24 mg/day (N=108) administered once \nper day for 5 days at month 0 and for 3 days at month 12 or subcutaneous IFNB-1a 44 µg (N=107) \nadministered 3 times per week for 3 years. Forty-six patients received a third course of LEMTRADA \ntreatment at 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day for 3 days at month 24.  \n \nAt 3 years, LEMTRADA reduced the risk of 6-month CDW by 76% (hazard ratio 0.24 [95% CI: 0.110, \n0.545], p<0.0006) and reduced the ARR by 67% (rate ratio 0.33 [95% CI: 0.196, 0.552], p<0.0001) as \ncompared to subcutaneous IFNB-1a. LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly lower EDSS scores \n(improved compared to baseline) through 2 years of follow up, compared with IFNB-1a (p<0.0001). \n \nIn the subgroup of RRMS patients with 2 or more relapses in the prior year and at least 1 Gd-enhanced T1 \nlesion at baseline, the annualised relapse rate was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.34) in the Lemtrada treated group (n \n= 205) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.64) in the IFNB-1a group (n = 102) (p<0.0001).

These results were obtained from a post hoc analysis \nand should be interpreted cautiously. \n \nLong-term efficacy data \nStudy 4, was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded, efficacy and safety extension study for \npatients with RRMS who participated in Study 1, 2, or 3 (prior phase 3 and 2 studies) to assess long-term \nefficacy and safety of LEMTRADA. The study provides efficacy and safety through a median of 6 years \nfrom entry into Studies 1 and 2. Patients in the extension study (Study 4) were eligible to receive additional \nas-needed LEMTRADA treatment course(s) upon documentation of resumed disease activity, defined as the \noccurrence of ≥1 MS relapse and/or ≥2 new or enlarging brain or spinal lesions on magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI). Additional course(s) of LEMTRADA were administered at 12 mg/day for 3 consecutive \ndays (36 mg total dose) at least 12 months after the prior treatment course.  \n \n91.8% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in Studies 1 and 2 entered Study 4. 82.7% of these \npatients completed the study. Approximately half (51.2%) of patients initially treated with LEMTRADA \n12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 who enrolled in Study 4, received only the initial 2 courses of LEMTRADA and \nno other disease modifying treatment throughout 6 years of follow-up. \n \n46.6% of the patients initially treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 received additional \ncourses upon documented evidence of MS disease activity (relapse and/or MRI) and the treating physician’s \ndecision to retreat. No characteristics at study entry identified patients who would later receive one or more \nadditional courses.  \n \nThrough 6 years from initial LEMTRADA treatment, patients continuing in follow-up showed rates of MS \nrelapse, brain lesion formation on MRI, and brain volume loss consistent with LEMTRADA’s treatment \neffects during Studies 1 and 2 as well as predominantly stable or improved disability scores. Including \nfollow-up in Study 4, patients originally treated with LEMTRADA in Studies 1 and 2, respectively, had \nARRs 0.17 and 0.23, CDW was seen in 22.3% and 29.7%, while 32.7% and 42.5% achieved CDI. In each \nyear of Study 4, patients from both studies continued to show a low risk of forming new T2 (27.4% to \n33.2%) or gadolinium-enhancing lesions (9.4% to 13.5%), and the median annual percent change in brain \nparenchymal fraction ranged from 0.19% to -0.09%. \n \nAmong patients who received one or two additional LEMTRADA treatment courses, improvements were \nseen in relapse rate, MRI activity and mean disability scores following a first or second LEMTRADA \nretreatment (Courses 3 and 4) when compared with outcomes in the preceding year. For these patients, the \nARR declined from 0.79 in the year prior to Course 3 to 0.18 one year after, and the mean EDSS score from \n2.89 to 2.69. The percentage of patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions declined from 50.8% the year prior \nto Course 3 to 35.9% one year after, and new gadolinium-enhancing lesions from 32.2% to 11.9%. Similar \nimprovements in ARR, mean EDSS score, and T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen after Course \n4 when compared with the prior year. These improvements were subsequently maintained, but no firm \nconclusions can be made with regards to the longer-term efficacy (e.g. 3 and 4 years after additional \ntreatment courses) because many patients completed the study before reaching these time points. \n \nThe benefits and risks of 5 or more treatment courses have not been established. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Data reflect the percentage of patients \nwhose test results were considered positive for antibodies to alemtuzumab using an enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by a competitive binding assay. Positive samples were further \nevaluated for evidence of in vitro inhibition using a flow cytometry assay. Patients in clinical trials in MS \nhad serum samples collected 1, 3, and 12 months after each treatment course for determination of anti-\nalemtuzumab antibodies.Approximately 85% of patients receiving LEMTRADA tested positive for anti-\nalemtuzumab antibodies during the study, with ≥90% of these patients testing positive also for antibodies \nthat inhibited alemtuzumab binding in vitro. Patients who developed anti-alemtuzumab antibodies did so by \n15 months from initial exposure. Through 2 treatment courses, there was no association of the presence of \nanti-alemtuzumab or inhibitory anti-alemtuzumab antibodies with a reduction in efficacy, change in \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\npharmacodynamics, or the occurrence of adverse reactions, including infusion associated reactions. High \ntiter anti-alemtuzumab antibodies observed in some patients were associated with incomplete lymphocyte \ndepletion following a third or fourth treatment course, but there was no clear impact of anti-alemtuzumab \nantibodies on the clinical efficacy or safety profile of LEMTRADA. \nThe incidence of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, \nthe observed incidence of antibody (including inhibitory antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced \nby several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant \nmedicines, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to \nLEMTRADA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nalemtuzumab in children from birth to less than 10 years in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLEMTRADA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in RRMS (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab were evaluated in a total of 216 patients with RRMS who received \nintravenous infusions of either 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day on 5 consecutive days, followed by 3 consecutive \ndays 12 months following the initial treatment course. Serum concentrations increased with each consecutive \ndose within a treatment course, with the highest observed concentrations occurring following the last \ninfusion of a treatment course. Administration of 12 mg/day resulted in a mean Cmax of 3014 ng/ml on day 5 \nof the initial treatment course, and 2276 ng/ml on day 3 of the second treatment course. The alpha half-life \napproximated 4-5 days and was comparable between courses leading to low or undetectable serum \nconcentrations within approximately 30 days following each treatment course.  \n \nAlemtuzumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and \nindividual amino acids by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have \nnot been conducted.  \n \nConclusions cannot be made with available data on the effect of race and gender on the pharmacokinetics of \nalemtuzumab. The pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in RRMS has not been studied in patients aged 55 \nyears and older.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis  \n \nThere have been no studies to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of alemtuzumab. \n \nFertility and reproduction \n \nTreatment with intravenous alemtuzumab at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, administered for 5 consecutive days \n(AUC of 7.1 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose) had no effect on fertility and \nreproductive performance in male huCD52 transgenic mice. The number of normal sperm was significantly \nreduced (<10%) relative to controls and the percent abnormal sperm (detached heads or no heads) were \nsignificantly increased (up to 3%). However, these changes did not affect fertility and were therefore \nconsidered to be non-adverse. \n \nIn female mice dosed with intravenous alemtuzumab up to 10 mg/kg/day (AUC of 4.7 times the human \nexposure at the recommended daily dose) for 5 consecutive days prior to cohabitation with wild-type male \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nmice, the average number of corpora lutea and implantation sites per mouse were significantly reduced as \ncompared to vehicle treated animals. Reduced gestational weight gain relative to the vehicle controls was \nobserved in pregnant mice dosed with 10 mg/kg/day. \n \nA reproductive toxicity study in pregnant mice exposed to intravenous doses of alemtuzumab up to \n10 mg/kg/day (AUC 2.4 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day) for \n5 consecutive days during gestation resulted in significant increases in the number of dams with all \nconceptuses dead or resorbed, along with a concomitant reduction in the number of dams with viable \nfoetuses. There were no external, soft tissue, or skeletal malformations or variations observed at doses up to \n10 mg/kg/day. \n \nPlacental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of alemtuzumab were observed during gestation and \nfollowing delivery in mice. In studies in mice, alterations in lymphocyte counts were observed in pups \nexposed to alemtuzumab during gestation at doses of 3 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (AUC 0.6 times the \nhuman exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day). Cognitive, physical, and sexual development of \npups exposed to alemtuzumab during lactation were not affected at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day alemtuzumab. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are administered this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side-effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side-effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n \n1. What LEMTRADA is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are administered LEMTRADA \n3. How LEMTRADA will be administered  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store LEMTRADA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What LEMTRADA is and what it is used for \n \nLEMTRADA contains the active substance alemtuzumab, which is used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis \n(MS) in adults, called relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). LEMTRADA does not cure MS, but it \ncan reduce the number of MS relapses. It can also help to slow down or reverse some of the signs and \nsymptoms of MS. In clinical studies, patients treated with LEMTRADA had fewer relapses and were less \nlikely to experience worsening of their disability compared to patients treated with a beta-interferon injected \nmultiple times per week. \nLEMTRADA is used if your MS is highly active despite that you have been treated with at least one other \nmedicine for MS or if your MS is rapidly evolving. \n \nWhat is multiple sclerosis? \nMS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). In MS your \nimmune system mistakenly attacks the protective layer (myelin) around the nerve fibres, causing \ninflammation. When the inflammation causes symptoms this is often called an “attack” or a “relapse”. In \nRRMS patients experience relapses followed by periods of recovery. \n \nThe symptoms you experience are determined by which part of your central nervous system is affected. The \ndamage done to your nerves during this inflammation may be reversible, but as your disease progresses the \ndamage may accumulate and become permanent. \n \nHow LEMTRADA works \nLEMTRADA adjusts your immune system to limit its attacks on your nervous system.  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n2. What you need to know before you are administered LEMTRADA \n \nDo not use LEMTRADA:  \n if you are allergic to alemtuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n if you are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). \n if you are suffering from a serious infection  \n if you have any of the following conditions: \n\no other autoimmune disease besides multiple sclerosis \no uncontrolled high blood pressure \no history of tears in blood vessels supplying the brain \no history of stroke \no history of heart attack or chest pain \no history of bleeding disorder \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before LEMTRADA is given. After having a course of treatment with LEMTRADA you \nmay be at greater risk of developing other autoimmune conditions, or experiencing serious infections. It is \nimportant you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. You will be given a Patient Alert Card \nand a Patient Guide with further information. It is important that you keep the Patient Alert Card with you \nduring treatment and for 4 years after your last infusion with LEMTRADA, because side effects may occur \nmany years after treatment. When you have medical treatment, even if it is not for your MS, show the Patient \nAlert Card to the doctor. \n \nYour doctor will perform blood tests before you start treatment with LEMTRADA. These tests are done to \nsee whether you may take LEMTRADA. Your doctor will also want to make sure that you do not have \ncertain medical conditions or disorders before you start your treatment with LEMTRADA. \n \n Autoimmune conditions \nTreatment with LEMTRADA may increase the risk for autoimmune conditions. These are conditions in \nwhich your immune system mistakenly attacks your body. Information about some specific conditions that \nhave been seen in MS patients who have been treated with LEMTRADA is provided below. \n \nThe autoimmune conditions can occur many years after treatment with LEMTRADA. Therefore, regular \nblood and urine tests are needed until 4 years after your last infusion. Testing is needed even if you are \nfeeling well and your MS symptoms are under control. There are certain signs and symptoms that you should \nlook out for yourself. In addition, these conditions may occur beyond 4 years, therefore, you must continue \nto look for signs and symptoms, even after you no longer need to do monthly blood and urine tests. Details \nabout the signs and symptoms, testing, and actions you need to take are described in sections 2 and 4 – \nautoimmune conditions.   \n \nMore helpful information about these autoimmune conditions (and the testing for them) can be found in the \nLEMTRADA Patient Guide. \n \n\no Acquired haemophilia A \nUncommonly, patients developed a bleeding disorder caused by antibodies that work against \nfactor VIII (a protein needed for normal clotting of blood), called acquired hemophilia A. This \ncondition must be diagnosed and treated immediately. Symptoms of acquired hemophilia A are \ndescribed in section 4. \n\n \no Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) \nCommonly, patients have developed a bleeding disorder caused by a low level of blood \nplatelets, called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This must be diagnosed and treated \nearly, as otherwise the effects can be serious or even fatal. Signs and symptoms of ITP are \ndescribed in section 4.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\no Kidney disease (such as anti-GBM disease) \nRarely, patients have experienced autoimmune related problems with their kidneys, such as anti-\nglomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease). Signs and symptoms of kidney \ndisease are described in section 4. If untreated it can cause kidney failure requiring dialysis or \ntransplantation, and may lead to death.  \n \no Thyroid disorders  \nVery commonly, patients have experienced an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland \naffecting its ability to make or control hormones that are important for your metabolism.  \nLEMTRADA may cause different types of thyroid disorders, including: \n\n Over-active thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) when the thyroid produces too much \nhormone \n\n Under-active thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) when the thyroid does not produce \nenough hormone. \n\n \nSigns and symptoms of thyroid disorders are described in section 4. \n \nIf you develop a thyroid disorder, in most cases you will need to be treated for the rest of your \nlife with medicines to control your thyroid disorder, and in some cases your thyroid gland may \nhave to be removed.  \n \nIt is very important that you are properly treated for a thyroid disorder, especially if you become \npregnant after using LEMTRADA. Having an untreated thyroid disorder could harm your \nunborn baby, or harm your baby after birth. \n\n \no Liver inflammation \nSome patients have developed liver inflammation after receiving LEMTRADA. Liver \ninflammation can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after \nLEMTRADA treatment. If you develop one or more of the following symptoms report this to \nyour doctor: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, yellow skin or eyes, \ndark urine, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. \n \no Other autoimmune conditions  \nUncommonly, patients have experienced autoimmune conditions involving red blood cells or \nwhite blood cells. These can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly \nafter LEMTRADA treatment. If you develop one of these conditions your doctor will tell you, \nand take appropriate measures to treat it.  \n \n\n Infusion reactions \nMost patients treated with LEMTRADA will experience side-effects at the time of the infusion or within 24 \nhours after the infusion. To try to reduce infusion reactions, your doctor will give you other medicine(s) (see \nsection 4 – infusion reactions). \n \n Other serious reactions occurring shortly after LEMTRADA infusion \nSome patients have had serious or life-threatening reactions after LEMTRADA infusion, including bleeding \nin the lung, heart attack, stroke or tears in blood vessels supplying the brain. Reactions may occur following \nany of the doses during the treatment course. In the majority of cases reactions occurred within 1-3 days of \nthe infusion. Your doctor will monitor vital signs, including blood pressure, before and during the infusion. \nGet help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: trouble breathing, coughing up blood, chest \npain, facial drooping, sudden severe headache, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty with speech or \nneck pain. \n \n Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis \nTreatment with LEMTRADA may increase the risk of excessive activation of white blood cells associated \nwith inflammation (haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated \nearly. If you experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your \ndoctor immediately. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n Infections \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA are at a higher risk of getting a serious infection (see section 4 – \ninfections). In general, the infections can be treated with standard medicines. \n \nIn order to reduce the chance of getting an infection, your doctor will check if other medicines you are taking \nmight be affecting your immune system. Therefore, it is important to tell your doctor about all medicines \nyou are taking. \n \nAlso, tell your doctor if you are suffering from a serious infection before the start of your LEMTRADA \ntreatment as your doctor should delay the treatment until the infection is resolved. \n \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA are at a higher risk of developing herpes infection (e.g. a cold sore). In \ngeneral, once a patient has had a herpes infection, they have an increased risk of developing another one. It is \nalso possible to develop a herpes infection for the first time. It is recommended that your doctor prescribes a \nmedicine to reduce the chance of developing a herpes infection, which should be taken on the days that you \nreceive LEMTRADA treatment, and for one month following the treatment.  \n \nIn addition, infections which can result in abnormalities of the cervix (the neck of the womb) are possible. \nTherefore, it is recommended that all female patients have an annual screening performed, such as a cervical \nsmear. Your doctor will explain to you what tests you will need. \n \nInfections with a virus called cytomegalovirus have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. \nMost cases occurred within two months of alemtuzumab dosing. Tell your doctor right away if you have \nsymptoms of infection such as fever, or swollen glands.  \n \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA have had infections due to a virus called Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),  \nincluding cases with severe liver inflammation. Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms of \ninfection such as fever, swollen glands, or fatigue.  \n \nPatients treated with LEMTRADA are also at a higher risk of developing listeria infection (a bacterial \ninfection caused by ingestion of contaminated foods). Listeria infection can cause serious illness, including \nmeningitis, but can be treated with appropriate medicines. To reduce this risk, you should avoid eating \nuncooked or undercooked meats, soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks before treatment, \nduring the treatment and for at least one month after LEMTRADA treatment. \n \n \nIf you live in a region where tuberculosis infections are common, you may be at greater risk of infection \nwith tuberculosis. Screening for tuberculosis will be arranged by your doctor. \n \nIf you are a carrier of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (these affect the liver), extra caution is needed \nbefore you receive LEMTRADA treatment as it is unknown if treatment could lead to activation of the \nhepatitis infection which could subsequently damage your liver.  \n \nThere have been cases of a rare brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy)in \npatients who have been given Lemtrada. PML has been reported in patients with other risk factors, \nspecifically prior treatment with MS products associated with PML. \nPML may lead to severe disability over weeks or months and may be fatal.  \nSymptoms may be similar to a relapse of MS and include progressive weakness  or clumsiness of limbs, \ndisturbance of vision, speech difficulties or  changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to \nconfusion and personality changes. It is important to inform your relatives or caregivers about your \ntreatment, since they may notice symptoms that you are not aware of. Contact your doctor immediately if \nyou develop any symptoms suggestive of PML. \n \n\n Pneumonitis and pericarditis \n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nPneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue) has been reported in LEMTRADA treated patients. Most cases \noccurred within the first month after treatment with LEMTRADA. Cases of pericardial effusion (collection \nof fluid around the heart) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart) have also been \nreported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. You should report to your doctor symptoms like shortness of \nbreath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness and coughing up blood, as these could be caused by \npneumonitis, pericardial effusion or pericarditis.  \n \n Inflammation of the gallbladder  \nLEMTRADA may increase your chance of getting inflammation of the gallbladder. This may be a serious \nmedical condition that can be life threatening. You should report to your doctor if you have symptoms such \nas stomach pain or discomfort, fever, nausea or vomiting.   \n \n Previously diagnosed cancer \nIf you have been diagnosed with cancer in the past, please inform your doctor about it. \n \n Vaccines \nIt is not known if LEMTRADA affects your response to a vaccine. If you have not completed the standard \nrequired vaccinations, your doctor will consider whether you should have them before your LEMTRADA \ntreatment. In particular, your doctor will consider vaccinating you against chickenpox if you have never had \nit. Any vaccination will need to be given to you at least 6 weeks before starting a LEMTRADA treatment \ncourse.  \n \nYou must NOT receive certain types of vaccines (live viral vaccines) if you have recently received \nLEMTRADA.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLEMTRADA is not intended to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old as it has not been \nstudied in MS patients below 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and LEMTRADA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines \n(including any vaccinations or herbal medecines). \n \nBesides LEMTRADA, there are other treatments (including those for MS, or to treat other conditions) which \ncould affect your immune system and so could affect your ability to fight infections. If you are using such a \nmedicine, your doctor may ask you to stop this medicine before starting treatment with LEMTRADA.  \n \nPregnancy  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice \nbefore being given this medicine. \n \nWomen who are able to conceive have to use effective contraception during each treatment course with \nLEMTRADA and for 4 months after each course of treatment. \n \nIf you become pregnant after treatment with LEMTRADA and experience a thyroid dirorder during \npregnancy, extra caution is needed. Thyroid disorders could be harmful to the baby (see section 2 Warnings \nand precautions – autoimmune conditions). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown if LEMTRADA can be transferred to a baby through breast milk, but there is a possibility that \nit could be. It is recommended that you do not breast-feed during each course of treatment with \nLEMTRADA and for 4 months after each treatment course. However, there may be benefits of breast milk \n(which can help protect a baby from infections), so talk to your doctor if you are planning to breast-feed your \nbaby. He/She will advise you what is right for you and your baby. \n \nFertility \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nDuring your treatment course and for 4 months afterwards, you may have LEMTRADA in your body. It is \nnot known if LEMTRADA will have an effect on fertility during this period. Talk to your doctor if you are \nthinking about trying to become pregnant. There is no evidence that LEMTRADA has an impact on male \nfertility.  \n \nDriving and using machines  \nMany patients experience side effects at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion with \nLEMTRADA, and some of these, for example dizziness, could make it unsafe to drive or use machines. If \naffected, stop these activities until you feel better. \n \nLEMTRADA contains potassium and sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘potassium- \nfree’. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium- free’. \n \n \n3. How LEMTRADA will be administered \n \nYour doctor will explain to you how LEMTRADA will be given. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. \n \nThe initial treatment you will receive will consist of one infusion per day for 5 days (course 1) and one \ninfusion per day for 3 days one year later (course 2). \nThere is no LEMTRADA treatment between the two courses. Two treatment courses may reduce MS activity \nfor up to 6 years. \n \nSome patients, if they have symptoms or signs of MS disease after the initial two courses, may receive one or \ntwo additional treatment courses consisting of one infusion per day for 3 days . These additional treatment \ncourses may be adminisitered  twelve months or more after the prior treatments. \n \nThe maximum daily dose is one infusion. \n \nLEMTRADA will be given to you as an infusion into a vein. Each infusion will take approximately 4 hours. \nMonitoring for side effects and regular testing must continue for 4 years after the last infusion. \n \nTo help you better understand the duration of the effects of treatment and the length of required follow-up, \nplease refer to the diagram below. \n \n \n\n  \n \nFollow-up after treatment with LEMTRADA  \nOnce you have received LEMTRADA, you will need to undergo regular tests to ensure that any potential \nside effects can be diagnosed and treated promptly. These tests must continue until 4 years after your last \ninfusion and are described in section 4 most important side-effects.  \n \nIf you are given more LEMTRADA than you should receive \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nPatients who were accidentally given too much LEMTRADA in one infusion have experienced serious \nreactions, such as headache, rash, low blood pressure or increased heart rate. Doses higher than the \nrecommended dose may result in more serious or longer lasting infusion reactions (see section 4) or a \nstronger effect on the immune system. The treatment consists of stopping LEMTRADA administration and \ntreating the symptoms. \n \nMissed LEMTRADA doses \nIt is unlikely that your dose would be missed since it is administered by a health care professional. \nNevertheless, please note that in case of missed dose, this should not be given on the same day as a scheduled \ndose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most important side effects are the autoimmune conditions described in section 2 which include: \n Acquired haemophilia A (a type of bleeding disorder), (uncommon - may affect up to 1 in 100 \n\npeople): may show as spontaneous bruising, nose bleeds, painful or swollen joints, other types of \nbleeding, or bleeding from a cut that may take longer than usual to stop. \n\n ITP (bleeding disorders), (common – may affect up to 1 in 10 people): may show as small scattered \nred, pink or purple spots on your skin; easy bruising; bleeding from a cut that is harder to stop; heavier, \nlonger or more frequent menstrual periods than normal; bleeding between menstrual periods; bleeding \nfrom your gums or nose that is new or takes longer than usual to stop; or coughing up blood. \n\n kidney disorders, (rare – may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): may show as blood in the urine (your \nurine may be red or tea-coloured), or as swelling in your legs or feet. It can also lead to damage of your \nlungs, which can result in coughing up blood. \n\n \nIf you notice any of these signs or symptoms for bleeding or kidney disorders, call your doctor \nimmediately to report the symptoms. If you cannot reach your doctor, you must seek immediate \nmedical attention. \n \n thyroid disorders (very common – may affect more than 1 in 10 people): may show as excessive \n\nsweating; unexplained weight-loss or gain; eye swelling; nervousness; fast heartbeat; feeling cold; \nworsening tiredness; or newly occurring constipation. \n\n red and white blood cells disorders (uncommon – may affect up to 1 in 100 people): diagnosed from \nyour blood tests. \n\n \nAll of these serious side effects can start many years after you have received LEMTRADA. If you notice \nany of these signs or symptoms, call your doctor right away to report them. You will also have regular \nblood and urine tests to ensure that if you develop any of these conditions, they are treated promptly.  \n \nSummary of tests you will have for autoimmune conditions: \n \n\nTest When? For how long? \n\nBlood test  \n(to diagnose all \nimportant serious side \neffects listed above) \n\nBefore treatment starts and every \nmonth after treatment  \n\nUntil 4 years after your last \nLEMTRADA infusion  \n\nUrine test  \n(additional test to \ndiagnose kidney \ndisorders) \n\nBefore treatment starts and every \nmonth after treatment \n\nUntil 4 years after your last \nLEMTRADA infusion \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \nAfter this time, if you have symptoms of ITP, acquired haemohilia A, kidney or thyroid disorders, your \ndoctor will perform more tests. You should also continue looking for signs and symptoms of side effects \nbeyond four years as detailed in your patient guide, and you should continue carrying the Patient Alert Card \nwith you. \n \nAnother side effect is an increased risk of infections (see below for information on how often patients \nexperience infections). In most cases, these are mild but serious infections can occur.  \n \n\nTell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of infection  \n• fever and/or chills \n• swollen glands \n\n \nTo help reduce the risk of some infections your doctor may consider giving you vaccination against \nchickenpox and/or other vaccinations that they think are necessary for you (see section 2: What you need to \nknow before you are administered LEMTRADA - Vaccines). Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine for \ncold sores (see section 2: What you need to know before you are administered LEMTRADA – Infections). \n \nThe most frequent side effects are infusion reactions (see below for information on how often patients \nexperience these), which can happen at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion. In most \ncases these are mild but some serious reactions are possible. Occasionally allergic reactions could occur.  \n \nTo try to reduce infusion reactions, your doctor will give you medicine (corticosteroids) before each of the \nfirst 3 infusions of a LEMTRADA course.

Remind the patient \nto remain vigilant for symptoms related to autoimmune conditions, and to seek medical help if they \nhave any concerns.  \n\n \nEducational Materials for Healthcare Providers are also available: \n \n\n LEMTRADA Health Care Professional Guide \n LEMTRADA Training Module \n LEMTRADA Prescriber’s Check-list \n\n \nRead the summary of product characteristics (available at the EMA website mentioned above) for more \ninformation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nInformation on preparing to administer LEMTRADA and patient monitoring \n \n\n Patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids immediately prior to LEMTRADA infusion for \nthe first 3 days on any treatment course. Pretreatment with antihistimines and/or antipyretics prior to \nLEMTRADA administration may also be considered. \n\n \n An oral anti-herpes agent should be administered to all patients during and for 1 month following \n\ntreatment. In clinical trials, patients were administered aciclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. \n \n\n Complete baseline tests and screening as decribed in SmPC section 4. \n \n\n The vial contents should be inspected for particulate matter and discolouration prior to \nadministration. Do not use if particulate matter is present or the concentrate is discoloured.  \nDO NOT SHAKE VIALS PRIOR TO USE. \n\n \n Use aseptic techniques to withdraw 1.2 ml of LEMTRADA from the vial and inject into 100 ml of \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose (5%) solution for infusion. The bag \nshould be inverted gently to mix the solution. Care should be taken to ensure the sterility of the \nprepared solution. \n\n \n Administer LEMTRADA infusion solution via intravenous administration over approximately 4 \n\nhours. \n \n\n Other medicinal products should not be added to the LEMTRADA infusion solution or \nsimultaneously infused though the same intravenous line. \n\n \n It is recommended that the product is used immediately after dilution, due to a possible risk for \n\nmicrobial contamination. If it is not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to \nuse are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 8 hours at 2oC to 8oC, under \nprotection from light.  \n \n\n Procedures for proper handling and disposal should be observed. Any spillage or waste material \nshould be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nAfter each infusion, the patient should be observed for 2 hours for infusion associated reactions.  \nSymptomatic treatment can be initiated if needed – see SmPC. Continue to test the patient every \nmonth for autoimmune conditions, until 4 years after last infusion. See LEMTRADA Health Care \nProfessional Guide for more information, or read the summary of product characteristics available at \nthe EMA website mentioned above. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnnex IV \nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \n\nauthorisation(s) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nScientific conclusions \n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alemtuzumab, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n\nDuring the reporting period, three case reports were identified indicating a potential causal association of \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and alemtuzumab. PML is a severe demyelinating \ndisease of the central nervous system that is caused by reactivation of the polyomavirus JC, which occurs \nalmost exclusively in immunosuppressed individuals. On the basis of this, updated risk minimizing \nmeasures are warranted. The PRAC recommends an update of the SmPC, section 4.4 and the patient \ninformation leaflet. \n\nCases of pericarditis with a potential causal association with alemtuzumab were identified during the \nreporting period. Due to the severity of pericarditis and the cases identified, an update of the SmPC is \nwarranted to include a warning of the risk of pericarditis. The PRAC recommends an update of the SmPC, \nsection 4.4. \n\nDuring the Article 20 referral procedure, Acquired haemophilia A was found to be related to treatment \nwith alemtuzumab. Taken the severity of Acquired haemophilia A into consideration, the PRAC suggests \nan update of the SmPC section 4.4 to re-enforce awareness of this risk. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for alemtuzumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alemtuzumab is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
