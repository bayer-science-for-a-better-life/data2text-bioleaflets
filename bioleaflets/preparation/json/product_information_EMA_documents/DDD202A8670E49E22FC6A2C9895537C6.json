This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nZykadia 150 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 150 mg ceritinib. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nCapsule with white opaque body and blue opaque cap, with “LDK 150MG” imprinted on the cap and \n\n“NVR” on the body, containing white to almost white powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nZykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic \n\nlymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). \n\n \n\nZykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma \n\nkinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with \n\ncrizotinib. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Zykadia should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \n\nanti-cancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nALK testing \n\n \n\nAn accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nALK-positive NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of Zykadia therapy. Assessment \n\nfor ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the \n\nspecific technology being utilised. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Zykadia is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food at the same time each \n\nday. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose with food is 450 mg taken orally once daily. Treatment should \n\ncontinue as long as clinical benefit is observed. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should make up that dose, unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. \n\n \n\nIf vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, the patient should not take an additional dose, but \n\nshould continue with the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nZykadia should be discontinued in patients unable to tolerate 150 mg daily taken with food. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to adverse reactions \n\nTemporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of Zykadia may be required based on individual \n\nsafety and tolerability. If dose reduction is required due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) not listed \n\nin Table 1, then this should be achieved by decrements of 150 mg daily. Early identification and \n\nmanagement of ADRs with standard supportive care measures should be considered. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with Zykadia 450 mg with food, 10% of patients had an adverse event that required \n\nat least one dose reduction and 42% of patients had an adverse event that required at least one dose \n\ninterruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Zykadia \n\nin the management of selected ADRs. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Zykadia dose adjustment and management recommendations for ADRs \n\n \n\nCriteria Zykadia dosing \n\nSevere or intolerable nausea, vomiting or \n\ndiarrhoea despite optimal anti-emetic or \n\nanti-diarrhoeal therapy \n\nWithhold Zykadia until improved, then reinitiate \n\nZykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) or \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation \n\n>5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) with \n\nconcurrent total bilirubin ≤2 times ULN \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to baseline \n\nALT/AST levels or to ≤3 times ULN, then reinitiate \n\nwith dose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nALT or AST elevation >3 times ULN with \n\nconcurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 times \n\nULN (in the absence of cholestasis or \n\nhaemolysis) \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\nAny grade treatment-related interstitial lung \n\ndisease (ILD)/pneumonitis \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\nQT corrected for heart rate (QTc) \n\n>500 msec on at least 2 separate \n\nelectrocardiograms (ECGs) \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to baseline or to a \n\nQTc ≤480 msec, check and if necessary correct \n\nelectrolytes, then reinitiate with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg. \n\nQTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from \n\nbaseline and torsade de pointes or \n\npolymorphic ventricular tachycardia or \n\nsigns/symptoms of serious arrhythmia \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nBradycardiaa (symptomatic, may be severe \n\nand medically significant, medical \n\nintervention indicated) \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to asymptomatic \n\n(grade ≤1) bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 beats \n\nper minute (bpm) or above. \n\nEvaluate concomitant medicinal products known to \n\ncause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive \n\nmedicinal products. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia at the previous dose upon recovery \n\nto asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of \n\n60 bpm or above. \n\nIf no contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified, or if contributing concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts are not discontinued or dose modified, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg \n\nupon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above. \n\nBradycardiaa (life-threatening \n\nconsequences, urgent intervention indicated) \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia if no contributing \n\nconcomitant medicinal product is identified. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg \n\nupon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent \n\nmonitoringb. \n\nPersistent hyperglycaemia greater than \n\n250 mg/dl despite optimal \n\nanti-hyperglycaemic therapy \n\nWithhold Zykadia until hyperglycaemia is \n\nadequately controlled, then reinitiate Zykadia with \n\ndose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nIf adequate glucose control cannot be achieved with \n\noptimal medical management, permanently \n\ndiscontinue Zykadia. \n\nLipase or amylase elevation grade ≥3 Withhold Zykadia until lipase or amylase returns to \n\ngrade ≤1, then reinitiate with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg. \na Heart rate less than 60 beats per minutes (bpm) \nb Permanently discontinue in the event of recurrence \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitors \n\nAvoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Zykadia (see section 4.5). If \n\nconcomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the dose by approximately one \n\nthird (dose not clinically verified), rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength. \n\nPatients should be carefully monitored for safety. \n\n \n\nIf long-term concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary and the patient \n\ntolerates the reduced dose well, the dose may be increased again with careful monitoring for safety, to \n\navoid potential under-treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume at the dose that was taken prior to initiating \n\nthe strong CYP3A inhibitor. \n\n \n\nCYP3A substrates \n\nWhen ceritinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be consulted for the recommendations regarding \n\nco-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates \n\nknown to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, \n\nsildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and \n\nalternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with \n\nnarrow therapeutic indices should be considered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. \n\nHowever, based on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible. Therefore, no dose \n\nadjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution should be used in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, as there is no experience with ceritinib in this population (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on available data, ceritinib is eliminated primarily via the liver. Particular caution should be \n\nexercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment and the dose should be reduced by \n\napproximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nElderly (≥65 years) \n\nThe limited data on the safety and efficacy of ceritinib in patients aged 65 years and older do not \n\nsuggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available \n\ndata on patients over 85 years of age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ceritinib in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nZykadia is for oral use. The capsules should be administered orally once daily with food at the same \n\ntime every day. It is important that Zykadia is taken with food to reach the appropriate exposure. Food \n\ncan range from a light to a full meal (see section 5.2). The capsules should be swallowed whole with \n\nwater and should not be chewed or crushed. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take Zykadia with food \n\nplease refer to section 4.5. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nCases of hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving ceritinib in clinical studies. Increases to \n\ngrade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients. The majority of cases were \n\nmanageable with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Few events required discontinuation of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored with liver laboratory tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior \n\nto the start of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly \n\nthereafter. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver \n\ntransaminases and total bilirubin should be carried out as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.8). Particular caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, and \n\nthe dose should be adjusted (see section 4.2). Limited experience in these patients showed a worsening \n\nof the underlying condition (hepatic encephalopathy) in 2 out of 10 patients exposed to 750 mg single \n\ndoses of ceritinib under fasted conditions (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). Other factors apart from study \n\ntreatment could have impacted on observed events of hepatic encephalopathy, however, the relation \n\nbetween study treatment and events cannot be fully ruled out. No dose adjustment is necessary in \n\npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nSevere, life-threatening or fatal ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in patients treated with ceritinib \n\nin clinical studies. Most of these severe/life-threatening cases improved or resolved with interruption \n\nof treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Other potential \n\ncauses of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded, and Zykadia permanently discontinued in patients \n\ndiagnosed with any grade treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\n \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with ceritinib (see \n\nsections 4.8 and 5.2), which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. \n\ntorsade de pointes) or sudden death. \n\n \n\nUse of Zykadia in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. The benefits and \n\npotential risks of ceritinib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who have \n\npre-existing bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats per minute [bpm]), patients who have a history \n\nof or predisposition for QTc prolongation, patients who are taking anti-arrhythmics or other medicinal \n\nproducts that are known to prolong the QT interval and patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac \n\ndisease and/or electrolyte disturbances. Periodic monitoring with ECGs and periodic monitoring of \n\nelectrolytes (e.g. potassium) is recommended in these patients. In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea, \n\ndehydration or impaired renal function, correct electrolytes as clinically indicated. Zykadia should be \n\npermanently discontinued in patients who develop QTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from baseline \n\nand torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious \n\narrhythmia. Zykadia should be withheld in patients who develop QTc >500 msec on at least two \n\nseparate ECGs until recovery to baseline or a QTc ≤480 msec, then reinitiated with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nBradycardia \n\n \n\nAsymptomatic cases of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) have been observed in 21 out of \n\n925 (2.3%) patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nUse of Zykadia in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta blockers, \n\nnon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) should be avoided as far as \n\npossible. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. In cases of symptomatic \n\nbradycardia that is not life-threatening, Zykadia should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic \n\nbradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, the use of concomitant medicinal products should be \n\nevaluated and the Zykadia dose adjusted if necessary. In the event of life-threatening bradycardia \n\nZykadia should be permanently discontinued if no contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified; however, if associated with a concomitant medicinal product known to cause bradycardia or \n\nhypotension, Zykadia should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate \n\nof 60 bpm or above. If the concomitant medicinal product can be adjusted or discontinued, Zykadia \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nshould be reinitiated with dose reduced by 150 mg on recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting occurred in 74.2% of 89 patients treated with Zykadia at the \n\nrecommended dose of 450 mg taken with food in a dose optimisation study and were mainly grade 1 \n\nevents (49.4%). One patient (1.1%) experienced grade 3 diarrhoea. Seven patients (7.9%) required \n\nstudy drug interruption due to diarrhoea or nausea. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal \n\nadverse drug reactions were higher for patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 76%, \n\nnausea 50%, vomiting 56%; 12% reported a grade 3/4 event) compared to 450 mg with food \n\n(diarrhoea 56%, nausea 45%, vomiting 35%; 1.1% reported a grade 3/4 event). \n\n \n\nNo patients required dose reduction or discontinuation of Zykadia due to diarrhoea, nausea or \n\nvomiting (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored and managed using standards of care, including anti-diarrhoeals, \n\nanti-emetics or fluid replacement, as clinically indicated. Dose interruption and dose reduction should \n\nbe employed as necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, \n\nthe patient should not take an additional dose, but should continue with the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nCases of hyperglycaemia (all grades) have been reported in less than 10% of patients treated with \n\nceritinib in clinical studies; grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was reported in 5.4% of patients. The risk of \n\nhyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for fasting plasma glucose prior to the start of Zykadia treatment and \n\nperiodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be \n\ninitiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nLipase and/or amylase elevations \n\n \n\nElevations of lipase and/or amylase have occurred in patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. \n\nPatients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of Zykadia treatment \n\nand periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Cases of pancreatitis have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with ceritinib (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nAgents that may increase ceritinib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitors \n\nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 450 mg fasted ceritinib dose with ketoconazole \n\n(200 mg twice daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, resulted in 2.9-fold and 1.2-fold \n\nincrease in ceritinib AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. The \n\nsteady-state AUC of ceritinib at reduced doses after co-administration with ketoconazole 200 mg \n\ntwice daily for 14 days was predicted by simulations to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib \n\nalone. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Zykadia. If it is not \n\npossible to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and \n\nnefazodone), reduce the ceritinib dose by approximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of \n\nthe 150 mg dosage strength. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume the ceritinib \n\ndose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nP-gp inhibitors \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If \n\nceritinib is administered with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp, an increase in ceritinib \n\nconcentration is likely. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and \n\nADRs carefully monitored. \n\n \n\nAgents that may decrease ceritinib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A and P-gp inducers \n\nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted ceritinib dose with rifampicin (600 mg \n\ndaily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, resulted in 70% and 44% decreases in ceritinib \n\nAUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. Co-administration of \n\nceritinib with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers decreases ceritinib plasma concentrations. Concomitant \n\nuse of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inducers. \n\n \n\nAgents that affect gastric pH \n\nCeritinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in vitro. \n\nAcid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) can alter the \n\nsolubility of ceritinib and reduce its bioavailability. Co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted \n\nceritinib dose with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) 40 mg daily for 6 days in healthy, fasting \n\nsubjects decreased ceritinib AUC by 76% and Cmax by 79%. The drug-drug interaction study was \n\ndesigned to observe the impact of proton pump inhibitor in the worst scenario, but in clinical use the \n\nimpact of proton pump inhibitor on ceritinib exposure appears to be less pronounced. A dedicated \n\nstudy to evaluate the effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on the bioavailability of ceritinib under \n\nsteady state has not been conducted. Caution is advised with concomitant use of proton pump \n\ninhibitors, as exposure of ceritinib may be reduced. There is no data with concomitant use of H2 \n\nblockers or antacids. However, the risk for a clinically relevant decrease in bioavailability of ceritinib \n\nis possibly lower with concomitant use of H2 blockers if they are administered 10 hours before or \n\n2 hours after the ceritinib dose, and with antacids if they are administered 2 hours before or 2 hours \n\nafter the ceritinib dose. \n\n \n\nAgents whose plasma concentration may be altered by ceritinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A and CYP2C9 substrates \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib competitively inhibits the metabolism of a CYP3A substrate, \n\nmidazolam, and a CYP2C9 substrate, diclofenac. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A was also \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nCeritinib has been classified in vivo as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and has the potential to interact with \n\nmedicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased serum \n\nconcentrations of the other product. Co-administration of a single dose of midazolam (a sensitive \n\nCYP3A substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily fasted) increased \n\nthe midazolam AUCinf (90% CI) by 5.4-fold (4.6, 6.3) compared to midazolam alone. \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates \n\nknown to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, \n\nsildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and \n\nalternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with \n\nnarrow therapeutic indices should be considered. \n\n \n\nCeritinib has been classified in vivo as a weak CYP2C9 inhibitor. Co-administration of a single dose \n\nof warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily \n\nfasted) increased the S-warfarin AUCinf (90% CI) by 54% (36%, 75%) compared to warfarin alone. \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C9 \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nsubstrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. phenytoin and warfarin) should be avoided. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP2C9 substrates \n\nwith narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. Increasing the frequency of international \n\nnormalised ratio (INR) monitoring may be considered if co-administration with warfarin is \n\nunavoidable. \n\n \n\nCYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib also inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 at clinically relevant \n\nconcentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of \n\nco-administered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these enzymes. Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates and ADRs carefully \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nA risk for induction of other PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely \n\nexcluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced. \n\n \n\nAgents that are substrates of transporters \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporter MRP2, hepatic uptake \n\ntransporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the \n\norganic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, \n\nclinical drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these \n\ntransporters are unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp \n\nand BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase \n\nplasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products transported by these proteins. Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, topotecan, \n\nsulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, pravastatin) and ADRs carefully \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, QT prolongation was observed with ceritinib. Therefore, ceritinib should be used \n\nwith caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval, including those \n\npatients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as class I (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, \n\ndisopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) anti-arrhythmics or other \n\nmedicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation such as domperidone, droperidol, chloroquine, \n\nhalofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, cisapride and moxifloxacin. Monitoring of the \n\nQT interval is indicated in the event of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nFood/drink interactions \n\n \n\nZykadia should be taken with food. The bioavailability of ceritinib is increased in the presence of \n\nfood. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take Zykadia with food, \n\nZykadia can be taken on an empty stomach as the alternate continued treatment regimen, in which no \n\nfood should be eaten for at least two hours before and one hour after the dose. Patients should not \n\nalternate between fasted and fed dosing. Dose must be adjusted properly, i.e for patients treated with \n\n450 mg or 300 mg with food, the dose should be increased to 750 mg or 450 mg taken on an empty \n\nstomach, respectively (see section 5.2) and for patients treated with 150 mg with food treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. For subsequent dose adjustment and management recommendations for \n\nADRs, please follow table 1 (see section 4.2). The maximum allowable dose under fasted condition is \n\n750 mg (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the \n\ngut wall and may increase the bioavailability of ceritinib. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use a highly effective method of contraception \n\nwhile taking Zykadia and for up to 3 months after discontinuing treatment (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceritinib in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nZykadia should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with ceritinib. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether ceritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant \n\ncannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from Zykadia \n\ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \n\nwoman (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe potential for Zykadia to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nZykadia has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen driving or using machines during treatment as patients may experience fatigue or vision \n\ndisorders. \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) described below reflect exposure to Zykadia 750 mg once daily fasted \n\nin 925 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC across a pool of seven clinical studies including \n\ntwo randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 studies (studies A2301 and A2303). \n\n \n\nThe median duration of exposure to Zykadia 750 mg fasted was 44.9 weeks (range: 0.1 to \n\n200.1 weeks). \n\n \n\nADRs with an incidence of ≥10% in patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted were diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, vomiting, fatigue, liver laboratory test abnormalities, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, \n\nweight decreased, constipation, blood creatinine increased, rash, anaemia and oesophageal disorder. \n\n \n\nGrade 3-4 ADRs with an incidence of ≥5% in patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted were liver \n\nlaboratory test abnormalities, fatigue, vomiting, hyperglycaemia, nausea and diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nIn the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients \n\nwith ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, the overall safety profile of Zykadia at the recommended dose \n\nof 450 mg with food (N=89) was consistent with Zykadia 750 mg fasted (N=90), except for a \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nreduction in gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure \n\n(see section 5.1 and subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of ADRs \n\n \n\nTable 2 shows the frequency category of ADRs reported for Zykadia in patients treated at a dose of \n\n750 mg fasted (N=925) in seven clinical studies. The frequency of selected gastrointestinal ADRs \n\n(diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) are based on patients treated with a dose of 450 mg once-daily with \n\nfood (N=89). \n\n \n\nADRs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs \n\nare ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding \n\nfrequency category using the following convention (CIOMS III) is also provided for each ADR: very \n\ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 2 ADRs in patients treated with Zykadia \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\nPreferred term \n\nZykadia \n\nN=925 \n\n% \n\nFrequency category \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAnaemia 15.2 Very common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite 39.5 Very common \n\nHyperglycaemia 9.4 Common \n\nHypophosphataemia 5.3 Common \n\nEye disorders \n\nVision disordera 7.0 Common \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nPericarditisb 5.8 Common \n\nBradycardiac 2.3 Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nPneumonitisd 2.1 Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDiarrhoeae 56.2 Very common \n\nNauseae 44.9 Very common \n\nVomitinge 34.8 Very common \n\nAbdominal painf 46.1 Very common \n\nConstipation 24.0 Very common \n\nOesophageal disorderg 14.1 Very common \n\nPancreatitis 0.5 Uncommon \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nAbnormal liver function testsh 2.2 Common \n\nHepatotoxicityi 1.1 Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nRashj 19.6 Very common \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nRenal failurek 1.8 Common \n\nRenal impairmentl 1.0 Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nFatiguem 48.4 Very common \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nLiver laboratory test abnormalitiesn 60.5 Very common \n\nWeight decreased 27.6 Very common \n\nBlood creatinine increased 22.1 Very common \n\nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged 9.7 Common \n\nLipase increased 4.8 Common \n\nAmylase increased 7.0 Common \n\nIncludes cases reported within the clustered terms: \na Vision disorder (vision impairment, vision blurred, photopsia, vitreous floaters, visual acuity \n\nreduced, accommodation disorder, presbyopia) \nb Pericarditis (pericardial effusion, pericarditis) \nc Bradycardia (bradycardia, sinus bradycardia) \nd Pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis) \ne The frequency of these selected gastrointestinal ADRs (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) is based on \n\npatients treated with the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg with food (N=89) in the study A2112 \n\n(ASCEND-8) (see subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below) \nf Abdominal pain (abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal discomfort, epigastric \n\ndiscomfort) \ng Oesophageal disorder (dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, dysphagia) \nh Abnormal liver function test (hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinaemia) \ni Hepatotoxicity (drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis cholestatic, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity) \nj Rash (rash, dermatitis acneiform, rash maculopapular) \nk Renal failure (acute renal injury, renal failure) \nl Renal impairment (azotaemia, renal impairment) \nm Fatigue (fatigue, asthenia) \nn Liver laboratory test abnormalities (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase \n\nincreased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, blood bilirubin increased, transaminases increased, \n\nhepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, liver function test increased, blood alkaline \n\nphosphatase increased) \n\n \n\nElderly (≥65 years) \n\n \n\nAcross seven clinical studies, 168 out of 925 patients (18.2%) treated with Zykadia were aged 65 years \n\nor older. The safety profile in patients aged 65 years or older was similar to that in patients less than \n\n65 years of age (see section 4.2). There are no safety data in patients older than 85 years of age. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nConcurrent elevations of ALT or AST greater than 3× ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN \n\nwithout elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% of patients in clinical \n\nstudies with ceritinib. Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients \n\nreceiving ceritinib. Hepatotoxicity events were managed with dose interruptions or reductions in \n\n40.6% of patients. 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of treatment in clinical studies \n\nwith ceritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nLiver laboratory tests including ALT, AST and total bilirubin should be performed prior to the start of \n\ntreatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter, with more \n\nfrequent testing for grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations. Patients should be monitored for liver laboratory test \n\nabnormalities and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nNausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were among the most commonly reported gastrointestinal events. In \n\nthe dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients \n\nwith ALK-positive advanced NSCLC at the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg taken with food \n\n(N=89), adverse events of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were mainly grade 1 (49.4%). A grade 3 \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nevent of diarrhoea was reported in one patient (1.1%). Gastrointestinal events were managed primarily \n\nwith concomitant medicinal products including anti-emetic/anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Seven \n\npatients (7.9%) required study drug interruption due to diarrhoea or nausea. No patients had diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, or vomiting that required dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug. The incidence and \n\nseverity of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions were reduced for patients treated with Zykadia \n\n450 mg with food (diarrhoea 56%, nausea 45%, vomiting 35%; 1.1% reported a grade 3/4 event) \n\ncompared to 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 76%, nausea 50%, vomiting 56%; 12% reported a grade 3/4 \n\nevent). Patients should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\n \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed in patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical \n\nstudies, 9.7% of patients treated with ceritinib had events of QT prolongation (any grade), including \n\ngrade 3 or 4 events in 2.1% of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 2.1% \n\nof patients and led to discontinuation in 0.2% of patients. \n\n \n\nTreatment with ceritinib is not recommended in patients who have congenital long QT syndrome or \n\nwho are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nParticular care should be exercised when administering ceritinib to patients with an increased risk of \n\nexperiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging medicinal product. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for QT prolongation and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4. \n\n \n\nBradycardia \n\n \n\nAcross the seven clinical studies, bradycardia and/or sinus bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) \n\nevents (all grade 1) were reported in 2.3% of patients. These events required dose reduction or \n\ninterruption in 0.2% of patients. None of these events led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment. The \n\nuse of concomitant medicinal products associated with bradycardia should be carefully evaluated. \n\nPatients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have been observed in \n\npatients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical studies, any grade ILD/pneumonitis has been \n\nreported in 2.1% of patients treated with ceritinib, and grade 3 or 4 events have been reported in 1.2% \n\nof patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 1.1% of patients and led to \n\ndiscontinuation in 0.9% of patients. Patients with pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis \n\nshould be monitored. Other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia (all grades) was reported in 9.4% of patients treated with ceritinib across the seven \n\nclinical studies; grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 5.4% of patients. These events required dose \n\nreduction or interruption in 1.4% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.1% of patients. The risk of \n\nhyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. \n\nMonitoring of fasting serum glucose is required prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and periodically \n\nthereafter as clinically indicated. Administration of anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be \n\ninitiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no reported experience with overdose in humans. General supportive measures should be \n\ninitiated in all cases of overdose. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplasic and immunomodulating agents, ATC code: L01XE28. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCeritinib is an orally highly selective and potent ALK inhibitor. Ceritinib inhibits autophosphorylation \n\nof ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins and proliferation of \n\nALK-dependent cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. \n\n \n\nALK translocation determines expression of the resulting fusion protein and consequent aberrant ALK \n\nsignaling in NSCLC. In the majority of NSCLC cases, EML4 is the translocation partner for ALK; this \n\ngenerates an EML4-ALK fusion protein containing the protein kinase domain of ALK fused to the \n\nN-terminal part of EML4. Ceritinib was demonstrated to be effective against EML4-ALK activity in a \n\nNSCLC cell line (H2228), resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and regression of \n\ntumours in H2228-derived xenografts in mouse and rat. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2301 (ASCEND-4) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Zykadia for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients who \n\nhave not received previous systemic treatment anti-cancer therapy (including ALK inhibitor) with the \n\nexception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, randomised, \n\nopen-label phase 3 Study A2301. \n\n \n\nA total of 376 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by WHO performance status, prior \n\nadjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and presence/absence of brain metastasis at screening) to receive \n\neither ceritinib (750 mg daily, fasted) or chemotherapy (based on investigator’s choice - pemetrexed \n\n[500 mg/m2] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [AUC 5-6], administered every 21 days). \n\nPatients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy (induction) without progressive disease \n\nsubsequently received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. \n\nOne hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred eighty-\n\nseven (187) were randomised to chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe median age was 54 years (range: 22 to 81 years); 78.5% of patients were younger than 65 years. A \n\ntotal of 57.4% of patients were female. 53.7% of the study population was Caucasian, 42.0% Asian, \n\n1.6% Black and 2.6% other races The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (96.5%) and had either \n\nnever smoked or were former smokers (92.0%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \n\nperformance status was 0/1/2 in 37.0%/56.4%/6.4% of patients, and 32.2% had brain metastasis at \n\nbaseline. 59.5% of patients with brain metastasis at baseline received no prior radiotherapy to the \n\nbrain. Patients with symptomatic CNS (central nervous system) metastases who were neurologically \n\nunstable or had required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage \n\nCNS symptoms, were excluded from the study. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of \n\ncontinued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy \n\narm could cross-over to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed by \n\nblinded independent review committee (BIRC). One hundred and five (105) patients out of the \n\n145 patients (72.4%) that discontinued treatment in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ALK \n\ninhibitor as first antineoplastic therapy. Of these patients 81 received ceritinib. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of follow-up was 19.7 months (from randomisation to cut-off date). \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in \n\nprogression free survival (PFS) by BIRC (see Table 3 and Figure 1). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was \n\nconsistent by investigator assessment and across various subgroups including age, gender, race, \n\nsmoking class, ECOG performance status and disease burden. \n\n \n\nThe overall survival (OS) data was not mature with 107 deaths representing approximately 42.3% of \n\nthe required events for the final OS analysis. \n\n \n\nEfficacy data from Study A2301 are summarised in Table 3, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and \n\nOS are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. \n\n \n\nTable 3 ASCEND-4 (Study A2301) - Efficacy results in patients with previously untreated \n\nALK-positive advanced NSCLC \n\n \n\n Ceritinib \n\n(N=189) \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(N=187) \n\nProgression-free survival (based on BIRC)   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 89 (47.1) 113 (60.4) \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) 16.6 (12.6, 27.2) 8.1 (5.8, 11.1) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 0.55 (0.42, 0.73) \n\np-valueb <0.001 \n\nOverall survivalc   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 48 (25.4) 59 (31.6) \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) NE (29.3, NE) 26.2 (22.8, NE) \n\nOS rate at 24 monthsd, % (95% CI) 70.6 (62.2, 77.5) 58.2 (47.6, 67.5) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 0.73 (0.50,1.08) \n\np-valueb 0.056 \n\nTumour response (based on BIRC)   \n\nOverall response rate (95% CI) 72.5% (65.5, 78.7) 26.7% (20.5, 33.7) \n\nDuration of response (based on BIRC)   \n\nNumber of responders 137 50 \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) 23.9 (16.6, NE) 11.1 (7.8, 16.4) \n\nEvent-free rate at 18 monthsd, % (95% \n\nCI) \n\n59.0 (49.3, 67.4) 30.4 (14.1, 48.6) \n\nHR=hazard ratio;

One hundred fifteen (115) patients were randomised to Zykadia and one hundred \n\nsixteen (116) were randomised to chemotherapy (either pemetrexed or docetaxel). Seventy-three (73) \n\npatients received docetaxel and 40 received pemetrexed. In the ceritinib arm, 115 patients were treated \n\nwith 750 mg once daily fasted. The median age was 54.0 years (range: 28 to 84 years); 77.1% of \n\npatients were younger than 65 years. A total of 55.8% of patients were female. 64.5% of the study \n\npopulation were Caucasian, 29.4% Asian, 0.4% Black and 2.6% other races. The majority of patients \n\nhad adenocarcinoma (97.0%) and had either never smoked or were former smokers (96.1%). The \n\nECOG performance status was 0/1/2 in 46.3%/47.6%/6.1% of patients respectively, and 58.0% had \n\nbrain metastasis at baseline. All patients were treated with prior crizotinib. All except one patient \n\nreceived prior chemotherapy (including a platinum doublet) for advanced disease; 11.3% of the \n\npatients in the ceritinib arm and 12.1% of the patients in the chemotherapy arm were treated with two \n\nprior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. \n\n \n\nPatients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of \n\ncontinued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy \n\narm could further crossover to receive Zykadia upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed \n\nby BIRC. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months (from randomisation to data cut-off date). \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS by \n\nBIRC with an estimated 51% risk reduction in the ceritinib arm compared to chemotherapy arm (see \n\nTable 4 and Figure 3). The PFS benefit of Zykadia was consistent across various subgroups including \n\nage, gender, race, smoking class, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases or prior \n\nresponse to crizotinib. The PFS benefit was further supported by local investigator assessment, and \n\nanalysis of overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nOS data was immature with 48 (41.7%) events in the ceritinib arm and 50 (43.1%) events in the \n\nchemotherapy arm, corresponding to approximately 50% of the required events for the final OS \n\nanalysis.

A key \n\nsecondary efficacy endpoint was ORR according to RECIST 1.1 as evaluated by BIRC. \n\n \n\nThe population characteristics across the two arms were: mean age 53 years, age less than 65 (79%), \n\nfemale (57%), Caucasian (54%), Asian (33%), never or former smoker (95%), WHO PS 0 or 1 (93%), \n\nadenocarcinoma histology (94%), and metastases to the brain (33%). \n\n \n\nEfficacy results from ASCEND-8 are summarised in Table 5 below. \n\n \n\nTable 5 ASCEND-8 (Study A2112) - Efficacy results in patients with previously untreated \n\nALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC by BIRC \n\n \n\nEfficacy Parameter Ceritinib 450 mg with food \n\n(N=41) \n\nCeritinib 750 mg fasted \n\n(N=40) \n\nOverall Response Rate (ORR: \n\nCR+PR), n (%) (95% CI)a \n\n32 (78.0) \n\n(62.4, 89.4) \n\n28 (70.0) \n\n(53.5, 83.4) \n\nCI: Confidence Interval \n\nComplete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessments performed not \n\nless than 4 weeks after response criteria were first met \n\nOverall response rate determined based on BIRC assessment per RECIST 1.1 \naExact binomial 95% confidence interval \n\n \n\nSingle arm studies X2101 and A2201 \n\nThe use of Zykadia in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with an ALK \n\ninhibitor was investigated in two global, multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 1/2 studies \n\n(Study X2101 and Study A2201). \n\n \n\nIn study X2101 a total of 246 ALK-positive NSCLC patients were treated at a Zykadia dose of 750 mg \n\nonce daily fasted: 163 who had received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor and 83 who were ALK \n\ninhibitor naïve. Of the 163 ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received prior treatment with an \n\nALK inhibitor, the median age was 52 years (range: 24-80 years); 86.5% were younger than 65 years \n\nand 54% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (66.3%) or Asian (28.8%). 93.3% had \n\nadenocarcinoma and 96.9% had either never been or were former smokers. All of the patients were \n\ntreated with at least one regimen prior to enrolment into the study and 84.0% with two or more \n\nregimens. \n\n \n\nStudy A2201 involved 140 patients who had been previously treated with 1-3 lines of cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy followed by treatment with crizotinib, and who had then progressed on crizotinib. The \n\nmedian age was 51 years (range: 29-80 years); 87.1% of patients were younger than 65 years and \n\n50.0% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (60.0%) or Asian (37.9%). 92.1% of \n\npatients had adenocarcinoma. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nThe main efficacy data for both studies are summarised in Table 6.

No efficacy data are available in patients over \n\n85 years of age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nZykadia in all subsets of the paediatric population in lung carcinoma (small cell and non-small cell \n\ncarcinoma) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nPeak plasma levels (Cmax) of ceritinib are achieved approximately 4 to 6 hours after a single oral \n\nadministration in patients. Oral absorption was estimated to be ≥25% based on metabolite percentages \n\nin the faeces. The absolute bioavailability of ceritinib has not been determined. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure of ceritinib was increased when administered with food. Ceritinib AUCinf values \n\nwere approximately 58% and 73% higher (Cmax approximately 43% and 41% higher) in healthy \n\nsubjects when a single 500 mg ceritinib dose was administered with a low fat meal (containing \n\napproximately 330 kcalories and 9 grams of fat) and a high fat meal (containing approximately \n\n1000 kcalories and 58 grams of fat), respectively, as compared with the fasted state. \n\n \n\nIn a dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in patients comparing Zykadia 450 mg or 600 mg \n\ndaily with food (approximately 100 to 500 kcalories and 1.5 to 15 grams of fat) to 750 mg daily under \n\nfasted conditions (dose and food condition of administration initially authorised), there was no \n\nclinically meaningful difference in the systemic steady-state exposure of ceritinib for the 450 mg with \n\nfood arm (N=36) compared to the 750 mg fasted arm (N=31), with only small increases in steady-state \n\nAUC (90% CI) by 4% (-13%, 24%) and Cmax (90% CI) by 3% (-14%, 22%). In contrast, the \n\nsteady-state AUC (90% CI) and Cmax (90% CI) for the 600 mg with food arm (N=30) increased by \n\n24% (3%, 49%) and 25% (4%, 49%), respectively, compared to the 750 mg fasted arm. The maximum \n\nrecommended dose of Zykadia is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAfter single oral administration of ceritinib in patients, plasma exposure to ceritinib, as represented by \n\nCmax and AUClast, increased dose-proportionally over the 50 to 750 mg dose range under fasted \n\nconditions. In contrast with single-dose data, pre-dose concentration (Cmin) after repeated daily dosing \n\nappeared to increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBinding of ceritinib to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97% in a concentration \n\nindependent manner, from 50 ng/ml to 10,000 ng/ml. Ceritinib also has a slight preferential \n\ndistribution to red blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.35. \n\nIn vitro studies suggest that ceritinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not of breast cancer \n\nresistance protein (BCRP) or multi-resistance protein 2 (MRP2). The in vitro apparent passive \n\npermeability of ceritinib was determined to be low. \n\n \n\nIn rats, ceritinib crosses the intact blood brain barrier with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of \n\nabout 15%. There are no data related to brain-to-blood exposure ratio in humans. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance \n\nof ceritinib. \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral administration of radioactive ceritinib dose at 750 mg fasted, ceritinib was the \n\nmain circulating component in human plasma. A total of 11 metabolites were found circulating in \n\nplasma at low levels with mean contribution to the radioactivity AUC of ≤2.3% for each metabolite. \n\nMain biotransformation pathways identified in healthy subjects included mono-oxygenation, \n\nO-dealkylation, and N-formylation. Secondary biotransformation pathways involving the primary \n\nbiotransformation products included glucuronidation and dehydrogenation. Addition of a thiol group \n\nto O-dealkylated ceritinib was also observed. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing single oral doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions, the geometric mean apparent plasma \n\nterminal half-life (T½) of ceritinib ranged from 31 to 41 hours in patients over the 400 to 750 mg dose \n\nrange. Daily oral dosing of ceritinib results in achievement of steady-state by approximately 15 days \n\nand remains stable afterwards, with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 6.2 after 3 weeks of daily \n\ndosing. The geometric mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ceritinib was lower at steady-state \n\n(33.2 litres/hour) after 750 mg daily oral dosing than after a single 750 mg oral dose (88.5 litres/hour), \n\nsuggesting that ceritinib demonstrates non-linear pharmacokinetics over time. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe primary route of excretion of ceritinib and its metabolites is in the faeces. Recovery of unchanged \n\nceritinib in the faeces accounts for a mean 68% of an oral dose. Only 1.3% of the administered oral \n\ndose is recovered in the urine. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ceritinib (750 mg under \nfasted conditions) was evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A; N=8), moderate (Child-\n\nPugh class B; N=7), or severe (Child-Pugh class C; N=7) hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy subjects \n\nwith normal hepatic function. The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was \n\nincreased by 18% (35%) and 2% (22%) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, \n\nrespectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nThe geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was increased by 66% (108%) in subjects \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). A \n\ndedicated pharmacokinetic study under steady-state in patients with hepatic impairment has not been \n\nconducted. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. Based \n\non available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible (1.3% of a single oral administered \n\ndose). \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 345 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 \n\nto <90 ml/min), 82 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min) and 546 patients \n\nwith normal renal function (≥90 ml/min), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients with mild and \n\nmoderate renal impairment and normal renal function, suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary \n\nin patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr \n\n<30 ml/min) were not included in the clinical studies of Zykadia (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nEffects of age, gender, and race \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, gender and race had no clinically meaningful \n\ninfluence on ceritinib exposure. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nThe potential for QT interval prolongation of ceritinib was assessed in seven clinical studies with \n\nZykadia. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect \n\nof ceritinib on the QT interval in 925 patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg once daily fasted. A \n\ncategorical outlier analysis of ECG data demonstrated new QTc >500 msec in 12 patients (1.3%). \n\nThere were 58 patients (6.3%) with a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec. A central tendency \n\nanalysis of the QTc data at average steady-state concentration from Study A2301 demonstrated that \n\nthe upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QTc increase from baseline was 15.3 msec at Zykadia \n\n750 mg fasted. A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ceritinib causes concentration-dependent \n\nincreases in QTc (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies indicate that ceritinib is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of the \n\nrespiratory and central nervous systems. In vitro data show that the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of \n\nceritinib on the hERG potassium channel was 0.4 micromolar. An in vivo telemetry study in monkeys \n\nshowed a modest QT prolongation in 1 of 4 animals after receiving the highest dose of ceritinib. ECG \n\nstudies in monkeys after 4- or 13-weeks of dosing with ceritinib have not shown QT prolongation or \n\nabnormal ECGs. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nThe micronucleus test in TK6 cells was positive. No signs of mutagenicity or clastogenicity were \n\nobserved in other in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceritinib. Therefore, genotoxic risk is \n\nnot expected in humans. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology studies (i.e. embryo-foetal development studies) in pregnant rats and rabbits \n\nindicated no foetotoxicity or teratogenicity after dosing with ceritinib during organogenesis; however, \n\nmaternal plasma exposure was less than that observed at the recommended human dose. Formal \n\nnon-clinical studies on the potential effects of ceritinib on fertility have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nThe principal toxicity related to ceritinib administration in rats and monkeys was inflammation of the \n\nextra-hepatic bile ducts accompanied by increased neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Mixed \n\ncell/neutrophilic inflammation of the extra-hepatic ducts extended to the pancreas and/or duodenum at \n\nhigher doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in both species characterised by body weight loss, \n\ndecreased food consumption, emesis (monkey), diarrhoea and, at high doses, by histopathological \n\nlesions including erosion, mucosal inflammation and foamy macrophages in the duodenal crypts and \n\nsubmucosa. The liver was also affected in both species, at exposures that approximate clinical \n\nexposures at the recommended human dose, and included minimal increases in liver transaminases in \n\na few animals and vacuolation of the intra-hepatic bile duct epithelium. Alveolar foamy macrophages \n\n(confirmed phospholipidosis) were seen in the lungs of rats, but not in monkeys, and the lymph nodes \n\nof rats and monkeys had macrophage aggregates. Target organ effects showed partial to complete \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n\nEffects on the thyroid were observed in both rat (mild increases in thyroid stimulating hormone and \n\ntriiodothyronine/thyroxine T3/T4 concentrations with no microscopic correlate) and monkey \n\n(depletion of colloid in males in 4-week study, and one monkey at high dose with diffuse follicular \n\ncell hyperplasia and increased thyroid stimulating hormone in 13-week study). As these non-clinical \n\neffects were mild, variable and inconsistent, the relationship between ceritinib and thyroid gland \n\nchanges in animals is unclear. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nZykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic \n\nlymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). \n\n \n\nZykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma \n\nkinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with \n\ncrizotinib. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Zykadia should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \n\nanti-cancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nALK testing \n\n \n\nAn accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nALK-positive NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of Zykadia therapy. Assessment \n\nfor ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the \n\nspecific technology being utilised. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Zykadia is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food at the same time each \n\nday. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose with food is 450 mg taken orally once daily. Treatment should \n\ncontinue as long as clinical benefit is observed. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should make up that dose, unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. \n\n \n\nIf vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, the patient should not take an additional dose, but \n\nshould continue with the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nZykadia should be discontinued in patients unable to tolerate 150 mg daily taken with food. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to adverse reactions \n\nTemporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of Zykadia may be required based on individual \n\nsafety and tolerability. If dose reduction is required due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) not listed \n\nin Table 1, then this should be achieved by decrements of 150 mg daily. Early identification and \n\nmanagement of ADRs with standard supportive care measures should be considered. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with Zykadia 450 mg with food, 10% of patients had an adverse event that required \n\nat least one dose reduction and 42% of patients had an adverse event that required at least one dose \n\ninterruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Zykadia \n\nin the management of selected ADRs. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Zykadia dose adjustment and management recommendations for ADRs \n\n \n\nCriteria Zykadia dosing \n\nSevere or intolerable nausea, vomiting or \n\ndiarrhoea despite optimal anti-emetic or \n\nanti-diarrhoeal therapy \n\nWithhold Zykadia until improved, then reinitiate \n\nZykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) or \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation \n\n>5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) with \n\nconcurrent total bilirubin ≤2 times ULN \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to baseline \n\nALT/AST levels or to ≤3 times ULN, then reinitiate \n\nwith dose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nALT or AST elevation >3 times ULN with \n\nconcurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 times \n\nULN (in the absence of cholestasis or \n\nhaemolysis) \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\nAny grade treatment-related interstitial lung \n\ndisease (ILD)/pneumonitis \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\nQT corrected for heart rate (QTc) \n\n>500 msec on at least 2 separate \n\nelectrocardiograms (ECGs) \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to baseline or to a \n\nQTc ≤480 msec, check and if necessary correct \n\nelectrolytes, then reinitiate with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg. \n\nQTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from \n\nbaseline and torsade de pointes or \n\npolymorphic ventricular tachycardia or \n\nsigns/symptoms of serious arrhythmia \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nBradycardiaa (symptomatic, may be severe \n\nand medically significant, medical \n\nintervention indicated) \n\nWithhold Zykadia until recovery to asymptomatic \n\n(grade ≤1) bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 beats \n\nper minute (bpm) or above. \n\nEvaluate concomitant medicinal products known to \n\ncause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive \n\nmedicinal products. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia at the previous dose upon recovery \n\nto asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of \n\n60 bpm or above. \n\nIf no contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified, or if contributing concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts are not discontinued or dose modified, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg \n\nupon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above. \n\nBradycardiaa (life-threatening \n\nconsequences, urgent intervention indicated) \n\nPermanently discontinue Zykadia if no contributing \n\nconcomitant medicinal product is identified. \n\nIf a contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, \n\nreinitiate Zykadia with dose reduced by 150 mg \n\nupon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent \n\nmonitoringb. \n\nPersistent hyperglycaemia greater than \n\n250 mg/dl despite optimal \n\nanti-hyperglycaemic therapy \n\nWithhold Zykadia until hyperglycaemia is \n\nadequately controlled, then reinitiate Zykadia with \n\ndose reduced by 150 mg. \n\nIf adequate glucose control cannot be achieved with \n\noptimal medical management, permanently \n\ndiscontinue Zykadia. \n\nLipase or amylase elevation grade ≥3 Withhold Zykadia until lipase or amylase returns to \n\ngrade ≤1, then reinitiate with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg. \na Heart rate less than 60 beats per minutes (bpm) \nb Permanently discontinue in the event of recurrence \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitors \n\nAvoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Zykadia (see section 4.5). If \n\nconcomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the dose by approximately one \n\nthird (dose not clinically verified), rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength. \n\nPatients should be carefully monitored for safety. \n\n \n\nIf long-term concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary and the patient \n\ntolerates the reduced dose well, the dose may be increased again with careful monitoring for safety, to \n\navoid potential under-treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume at the dose that was taken prior to initiating \n\nthe strong CYP3A inhibitor. \n\n \n\nCYP3A substrates \n\nWhen ceritinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be consulted for the recommendations regarding \n\nco-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates \n\nknown to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, \n\nsildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and \n\nalternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with \n\nnarrow therapeutic indices should be considered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. \n\nHowever, based on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible. Therefore, no dose \n\nadjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution should be used in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment, as there is no experience with ceritinib in this population (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on available data, ceritinib is eliminated primarily via the liver. Particular caution should be \n\nexercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment and the dose should be reduced by \n\napproximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nElderly (≥65 years) \n\nThe limited data on the safety and efficacy of ceritinib in patients aged 65 years and older do not \n\nsuggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available \n\ndata on patients over 85 years of age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ceritinib in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nZykadia is for oral use. The tablets should be administered orally once daily with food at the same \n\ntime every day. It is important that Zykadia is taken with food to reach the appropriate exposure. Food \n\ncan range from a light to a full meal (see section 5.2). The tablets should be swallowed whole with \n\nwater and should not be chewed or crushed. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take Zykadia with food \n\nplease refer to section 4.5. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nCases of hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving ceritinib in clinical studies. Increases to \n\ngrade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients. The majority of cases were \n\nmanageable with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Few events required discontinuation of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored with liver laboratory tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior \n\nto the start of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly \n\nthereafter. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver \n\ntransaminases and total bilirubin should be carried out as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.8). Particular caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, and \n\nthe dose should be adjusted (see section 4.2). Limited experience in these patients showed a worsening \n\nof the underlying condition (hepatic encephalopathy) in 2 out of 10 patients exposed to 750 mg single \n\ndoses of ceritinib under fasted conditions (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). Other factors apart from study \n\ntreatment could have impacted on observed events of hepatic encephalopathy, however, the relation \n\nbetween study treatment and events cannot be fully ruled out. No dose adjustment is necessary in \n\npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nSevere, life-threatening or fatal ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in patients treated with ceritinib \n\nin clinical studies. Most of these severe/life-threatening cases improved or resolved with interruption \n\nof treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Other potential \n\ncauses of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded, and Zykadia permanently discontinued in patients \n\ndiagnosed with any grade treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\n \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with ceritinib (see \n\nsections 4.8 and 5.2), which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. \n\ntorsade de pointes) or sudden death. \n\n \n\nUse of Zykadia in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. The benefits and \n\npotential risks of ceritinib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who have \n\npre-existing bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats per minute [bpm]), patients who have a history \n\nof or predisposition for QTc prolongation, patients who are taking anti-arrhythmics or other medicinal \n\nproducts that are known to prolong the QT interval and patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac \n\ndisease and/or electrolyte disturbances. Periodic monitoring with ECGs and periodic monitoring of \n\nelectrolytes (e.g. potassium) is recommended in these patients. In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea, \n\ndehydration or impaired renal function, correct electrolytes as clinically indicated. Zykadia should be \n\npermanently discontinued in patients who develop QTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from baseline \n\nand torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious \n\narrhythmia. Zykadia should be withheld in patients who develop QTc >500 msec on at least two \n\nseparate ECGs until recovery to baseline or a QTc ≤480 msec, then reinitiated with dose reduced by \n\n150 mg (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nBradycardia \n\n \n\nAsymptomatic cases of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) have been observed in 21 out of \n\n925 (2.3%) patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nUse of Zykadia in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta blockers, \n\nnon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) should be avoided as far as \n\npossible. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. In cases of symptomatic \n\nbradycardia that is not life-threatening, Zykadia should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic \n\nbradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, the use of concomitant medicinal products should be \n\nevaluated and the Zykadia dose adjusted if necessary. In the event of life-threatening bradycardia \n\nZykadia should be permanently discontinued if no contributing concomitant medicinal product is \n\nidentified; however, if associated with a concomitant medicinal product known to cause bradycardia or \n\nhypotension, Zykadia should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate \n\nof 60 bpm or above. If the concomitant medicinal product can be adjusted or discontinued, Zykadia \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nshould be reinitiated with dose reduced by 150 mg on recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a \n\nheart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting occurred in 74.2% of 89 patients treated with Zykadia at the \n\nrecommended dose of 450 mg taken with food in a dose optimisation study and were mainly grade 1 \n\nevents (49.4%). One patient (1.1%) experienced grade 3 diarrhoea. Seven patients (7.9%) required \n\nstudy drug interruption due to diarrhoea or nausea. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal \n\nadverse drug reactions were higher for patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 76%, \n\nnausea 50%, vomiting 56%; 12% reported a grade 3/4 event) compared to 450 mg with food \n\n(diarrhoea 56%, nausea 45%, vomiting 35%; 1.1% reported a grade 3/4 event). \n\n \n\nNo patients required dose reduction or discontinuation of Zykadia due to diarrhoea, nausea or \n\nvomiting (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored and managed using standards of care, including anti-diarrhoeals, \n\nanti-emetics or fluid replacement, as clinically indicated. Dose interruption and dose reduction should \n\nbe employed as necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, \n\nthe patient should not take an additional dose, but should continue with the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nCases of hyperglycaemia (all grades) have been reported in less than 10% of patients treated with \n\nceritinib in clinical studies; grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was reported in 5.4% of patients. The risk of \n\nhyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for fasting plasma glucose prior to the start of Zykadia treatment and \n\nperiodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be \n\ninitiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nLipase and/or amylase elevations \n\n \n\nElevations of lipase and/or amylase have occurred in patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. \n\nPatients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of Zykadia treatment \n\nand periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Cases of pancreatitis have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with ceritinib (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nAgents that may increase ceritinib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitors \n\nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 450 mg fasted ceritinib dose with ketoconazole \n\n(200 mg twice daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, resulted in 2.9-fold and 1.2-fold \n\nincrease in ceritinib AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. The \n\nsteady-state AUC of ceritinib at reduced doses after co-administration with ketoconazole 200 mg \n\ntwice daily for 14 days was predicted by simulations to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib \n\nalone. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Zykadia. If it is not \n\npossible to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and \n\nnefazodone), reduce the ceritinib dose by approximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of \n\nthe 150 mg dosage strength. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume the ceritinib \n\ndose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nP-gp inhibitors \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If \n\nceritinib is administered with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp, an increase in ceritinib \n\nconcentration is likely. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and \n\nADRs carefully monitored. \n\n \n\nAgents that may decrease ceritinib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A and P-gp inducers \n\nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted ceritinib dose with rifampicin (600 mg \n\ndaily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, resulted in 70% and 44% decreases in ceritinib \n\nAUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. Co-administration of \n\nceritinib with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers decreases ceritinib plasma concentrations. Concomitant \n\nuse of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inducers. \n\n \n\nAgents that affect gastric pH \n\nCeritinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in vitro. \n\nAcid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) can alter the \n\nsolubility of ceritinib and reduce its bioavailability. Co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted \n\nceritinib dose with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) 40 mg daily for 6 days in healthy, fasting \n\nsubjects decreased ceritinib AUC by 76% and Cmax by 79%. The drug-drug interaction study was \n\ndesigned to observe the impact of proton pump inhibitor in the worst scenario, but in clinical use the \n\nimpact of proton pump inhibitor on ceritinib exposure appears to be less pronounced. A dedicated \n\nstudy to evaluate the effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on the bioavailability of ceritinib under \n\nsteady state has not been conducted. Caution is advised with concomitant use of proton pump \n\ninhibitors, as exposure of ceritinib may be reduced. There is no data with concomitant use of H2 \n\nblockers or antacids. However, the risk for a clinically relevant decrease in bioavailability of ceritinib \n\nis possibly lower with concomitant use of H2 blockers if they are administered 10 hours before or \n\n2 hours after the ceritinib dose, and with antacids if they are administered 2 hours before or 2 hours \n\nafter the ceritinib dose. \n\n \n\nAgents whose plasma concentration may be altered by ceritinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A and CYP2C9 substrates \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib competitively inhibits the metabolism of a CYP3A substrate, \n\nmidazolam, and a CYP2C9 substrate, diclofenac. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A was also \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nCeritinib has been classified in vivo as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and has the potential to interact with \n\nmedicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased serum \n\nconcentrations of the other product. Co-administration of a single dose of midazolam (a sensitive \n\nCYP3A substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily fasted) increased \n\nthe midazolam AUCinf (90% CI) by 5.4-fold (4.6, 6.3) compared to midazolam alone. \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates \n\nknown to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, \n\nsildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and \n\nalternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with \n\nnarrow therapeutic indices should be considered. \n\n \n\nCeritinib has been classified in vivo as a weak CYP2C9 inhibitor. Co-administration of a single dose \n\nof warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily \n\nfasted) increased the S-warfarin AUCinf (90% CI) by 54% (36%, 75%) compared to warfarin alone. \n\nCo-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C9 \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nsubstrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. phenytoin and warfarin) should be avoided. \n\nIf unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP2C9 substrates \n\nwith narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. Increasing the frequency of international \n\nnormalised ratio (INR) monitoring may be considered if co-administration with warfarin is \n\nunavoidable. \n\n \n\nCYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib also inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 at clinically relevant \n\nconcentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of \n\nco-administered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these enzymes. Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates and ADRs carefully \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nA risk for induction of other PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely \n\nexcluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced. \n\n \n\nAgents that are substrates of transporters \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporter MRP2, hepatic uptake \n\ntransporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the \n\norganic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, \n\nclinical drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these \n\ntransporters are unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp \n\nand BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase \n\nplasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products transported by these proteins. Caution \n\nshould be exercised with concomitant use of BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, topotecan, \n\nsulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, pravastatin) and ADRs carefully \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, QT prolongation was observed with ceritinib. Therefore, ceritinib should be used \n\nwith caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval, including those \n\npatients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as class I (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, \n\ndisopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) anti-arrhythmics or other \n\nmedicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation such as domperidone, droperidol, chloroquine, \n\nhalofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, cisapride and moxifloxacin. Monitoring of the \n\nQT interval is indicated in the event of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nFood/drink interactions \n\n \n\nZykadia should be taken with food. The bioavailability of ceritinib is increased in the presence of \n\nfood. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take Zykadia with food, \n\nZykadia can be taken on an empty stomach as the alternate continued treatment regimen, in which no \n\nfood should be eaten for at least two hours before and one hour after the dose. Patients should not \n\nalternate between fasted and fed dosing. Dose must be adjusted properly, i.e for patients treated with \n\n450 mg or 300 mg with food, the dose should be increased to 750 mg or 450 mg taken on an empty \n\nstomach, respectively (see section 5.2) and for patients treated with 150 mg with food treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. For subsequent dose adjustment and management recommendations for \n\nADRs, please follow table 1 (see section 4.2). The maximum allowable dose under fasted condition is \n\n750 mg (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the \n\ngut wall and may increase the bioavailability of ceritinib. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use a highly effective method of contraception \n\nwhile taking Zykadia and for up to 3 months after discontinuing treatment (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceritinib in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nZykadia should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with ceritinib. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether ceritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant \n\ncannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from Zykadia \n\ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \n\nwoman (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe potential for Zykadia to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nZykadia has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen driving or using machines during treatment as patients may experience fatigue or vision \n\ndisorders. \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) described below reflect exposure to Zykadia 750 mg once daily fasted \n\nin 925 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC across a pool of seven clinical studies including \n\ntwo randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 studies (studies A2301 and A2303). \n\n \n\nThe median duration of exposure to Zykadia 750 mg fasted was 44.9 weeks (range: 0.1 to \n\n200.1 weeks). \n\n \n\nADRs with an incidence of ≥10% in patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted were diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, vomiting, fatigue, liver laboratory test abnormalities, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, \n\nweight decreased, constipation, blood creatinine increased, rash, anaemia and oesophageal disorder. \n\n \n\nGrade 3-4 ADRs with an incidence of ≥5% in patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg fasted were liver \n\nlaboratory test abnormalities, fatigue, vomiting, hyperglycaemia, nausea and diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nIn the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients \n\nwith ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, the overall safety profile of Zykadia at the recommended dose \n\nof 450 mg with food (N=89) was consistent with Zykadia 750 mg fasted (N=90), except for a \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nreduction in gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure \n\n(see section 5.1 and subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of ADRs \n\n \n\nTable 2 shows the frequency category of ADRs reported for Zykadia in patients treated at a dose of \n\n750 mg fasted (N=925) in seven clinical studies. The frequency of selected gastrointestinal ADRs \n\n(diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) are based on patients treated with a dose of 450 mg once-daily with \n\nfood (N=89). \n\n \n\nADRs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs \n\nare ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding \n\nfrequency category using the following convention (CIOMS III) is also provided for each ADR: very \n\ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 2 ADRs in patients treated with Zykadia \n\n \n\nSystem organ class \n\nPreferred term \n\nZykadia \n\nN=925 \n\n% \n\nFrequency category \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAnaemia 15.2 Very common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nDecreased appetite 39.5 Very common \n\nHyperglycaemia 9.4 Common \n\nHypophosphataemia 5.3 Common \n\nEye disorders \n\nVision disordera 7.0 Common \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nPericarditisb 5.8 Common \n\nBradycardiac 2.3 Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nPneumonitisd 2.1 Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDiarrhoeae 56.2 Very common \n\nNauseae 44.9 Very common \n\nVomitinge 34.8 Very common \n\nAbdominal painf 46.1 Very common \n\nConstipation 24.0 Very common \n\nOesophageal disorderg 14.1 Very common \n\nPancreatitis 0.5 Uncommon \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nAbnormal liver function testsh 2.2 Common \n\nHepatotoxicityi 1.1 Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nRashj 19.6 Very common \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nRenal failurek 1.8 Common \n\nRenal impairmentl 1.0 Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nFatiguem 48.4 Very common \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nLiver laboratory test abnormalitiesn 60.5 Very common \n\nWeight decreased 27.6 Very common \n\nBlood creatinine increased 22.1 Very common \n\nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged 9.7 Common \n\nLipase increased 4.8 Common \n\nAmylase increased 7.0 Common \n\nIncludes cases reported within the clustered terms: \na Vision disorder (vision impairment, vision blurred, photopsia, vitreous floaters, visual acuity \n\nreduced, accommodation disorder, presbyopia) \nb Pericarditis (pericardial effusion, pericarditis) \nc Bradycardia (bradycardia, sinus bradycardia) \nd Pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis) \ne The frequency of these selected gastrointestinal ADRs (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) is based on \n\npatients treated with the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg with food (N=89) in the study A2112 \n\n(ASCEND-8) (see subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below) \nf Abdominal pain (abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal discomfort, epigastric \n\ndiscomfort) \ng Oesophageal disorder (dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, dysphagia) \nh Abnormal liver function test (hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinaemia) \ni Hepatotoxicity (drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis cholestatic, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity) \nj Rash (rash, dermatitis acneiform, rash maculopapular) \nk Renal failure (acute renal injury, renal failure) \nl Renal impairment (azotaemia, renal impairment) \nm Fatigue (fatigue, asthenia) \nn Liver laboratory test abnormalities (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase \n\nincreased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, blood bilirubin increased, transaminases increased, \n\nhepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, liver function test increased, blood alkaline \n\nphosphatase increased) \n\n \n\nElderly (≥65 years) \n\n \n\nAcross seven clinical studies, 168 out of 925 patients (18.2%) treated with Zykadia were aged 65 years \n\nor older. The safety profile in patients aged 65 years or older was similar to that in patients less than \n\n65 years of age (see section 4.2). There are no safety data in patients older than 85 years of age. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nConcurrent elevations of ALT or AST greater than 3× ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN \n\nwithout elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% of patients in clinical \n\nstudies with ceritinib. Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients \n\nreceiving ceritinib. Hepatotoxicity events were managed with dose interruptions or reductions in \n\n40.6% of patients. 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of treatment in clinical studies \n\nwith ceritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nLiver laboratory tests including ALT, AST and total bilirubin should be performed prior to the start of \n\ntreatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter, with more \n\nfrequent testing for grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations. Patients should be monitored for liver laboratory test \n\nabnormalities and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nNausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were among the most commonly reported gastrointestinal events. In \n\nthe dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients \n\nwith ALK-positive advanced NSCLC at the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg taken with food \n\n(N=89), adverse events of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were mainly grade 1 (49.4%). A grade 3 \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nevent of diarrhoea was reported in one patient (1.1%). Gastrointestinal events were managed primarily \n\nwith concomitant medicinal products including anti-emetic/anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Seven \n\npatients (7.9%) required study drug interruption due to diarrhoea or nausea. No patients had diarrhoea, \n\nnausea, or vomiting that required dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug. The incidence and \n\nseverity of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions were reduced for patients treated with Zykadia \n\n450 mg with food (diarrhoea 56%, nausea 45%, vomiting 35%; 1.1% reported a grade 3/4 event) \n\ncompared to 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 76%, nausea 50%, vomiting 56%; 12% reported a grade 3/4 \n\nevent). Patients should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. \n\n \n\nQT interval prolongation \n\n \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed in patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical \n\nstudies, 9.7% of patients treated with ceritinib had events of QT prolongation (any grade), including \n\ngrade 3 or 4 events in 2.1% of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 2.1% \n\nof patients and led to discontinuation in 0.2% of patients. \n\n \n\nTreatment with ceritinib is not recommended in patients who have congenital long QT syndrome or \n\nwho are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nParticular care should be exercised when administering ceritinib to patients with an increased risk of \n\nexperiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging medicinal product. \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for QT prolongation and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4. \n\n \n\nBradycardia \n\n \n\nAcross the seven clinical studies, bradycardia and/or sinus bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) \n\nevents (all grade 1) were reported in 2.3% of patients. These events required dose reduction or \n\ninterruption in 0.2% of patients. None of these events led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment. The \n\nuse of concomitant medicinal products associated with bradycardia should be carefully evaluated. \n\nPatients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have been observed in \n\npatients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical studies, any grade ILD/pneumonitis has been \n\nreported in 2.1% of patients treated with ceritinib, and grade 3 or 4 events have been reported in 1.2% \n\nof patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 1.1% of patients and led to \n\ndiscontinuation in 0.9% of patients. Patients with pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis \n\nshould be monitored. Other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia (all grades) was reported in 9.4% of patients treated with ceritinib across the seven \n\nclinical studies; grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 5.4% of patients. These events required dose \n\nreduction or interruption in 1.4% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.1% of patients. The risk of \n\nhyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. \n\nMonitoring of fasting serum glucose is required prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and periodically \n\nthereafter as clinically indicated. Administration of anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be \n\ninitiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no reported experience with overdose in humans. General supportive measures should be \n\ninitiated in all cases of overdose. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplasic and immunomodulating agents, ATC code: L01XE28. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCeritinib is an orally highly selective and potent ALK inhibitor. Ceritinib inhibits autophosphorylation \n\nof ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins and proliferation of \n\nALK-dependent cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. \n\n \n\nALK translocation determines expression of the resulting fusion protein and consequent aberrant ALK \n\nsignaling in NSCLC. In the majority of NSCLC cases, EML4 is the translocation partner for ALK; this \n\ngenerates an EML4-ALK fusion protein containing the protein kinase domain of ALK fused to the \n\nN-terminal part of EML4. Ceritinib was demonstrated to be effective against EML4-ALK activity in a \n\nNSCLC cell line (H2228), resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and regression of \n\ntumours in H2228-derived xenografts in mouse and rat. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2301 (ASCEND-4) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Zykadia for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients who \n\nhave not received previous systemic treatment anti-cancer therapy (including ALK inhibitor) with the \n\nexception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, randomised, \n\nopen-label phase 3 Study A2301. \n\n \n\nA total of 376 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by WHO performance status, prior \n\nadjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and presence/absence of brain metastasis at screening) to receive \n\neither ceritinib (750 mg daily, fasted) or chemotherapy (based on investigator’s choice - pemetrexed \n\n[500 mg/m2] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [AUC 5-6], administered every 21 days). \n\nPatients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy (induction) without progressive disease \n\nsubsequently received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. \n\nOne hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred eighty-\n\nseven (187) were randomised to chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe median age was 54 years (range: 22 to 81 years); 78.5% of patients were younger than 65 years. A \n\ntotal of 57.4% of patients were female. 53.7% of the study population was Caucasian, 42.0% Asian, \n\n1.6% Black and 2.6% other races The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (96.5%) and had either \n\nnever smoked or were former smokers (92.0%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \n\nperformance status was 0/1/2 in 37.0%/56.4%/6.4% of patients, and 32.2% had brain metastasis at \n\nbaseline. 59.5% of patients with brain metastasis at baseline received no prior radiotherapy to the \n\nbrain. Patients with symptomatic CNS (central nervous system) metastases who were neurologically \n\nunstable or had required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage \n\nCNS symptoms, were excluded from the study. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of \n\ncontinued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy \n\narm could cross-over to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed by \n\nblinded independent review committee (BIRC). One hundred and five (105) patients out of the \n\n145 patients (72.4%) that discontinued treatment in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ALK \n\ninhibitor as first antineoplastic therapy. Of these patients 81 received ceritinib. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of follow-up was 19.7 months (from randomisation to cut-off date). \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in \n\nprogression free survival (PFS) by BIRC (see Table 3 and Figure 1). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was \n\nconsistent by investigator assessment and across various subgroups including age, gender, race, \n\nsmoking class, ECOG performance status and disease burden. \n\n \n\nThe overall survival (OS) data was not mature with 107 deaths representing approximately 42.3% of \n\nthe required events for the final OS analysis. \n\n \n\nEfficacy data from Study A2301 are summarised in Table 3, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and \n\nOS are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. \n\n \n\nTable 3 ASCEND-4 (Study A2301) - Efficacy results in patients with previously untreated \n\nALK-positive advanced NSCLC \n\n \n\n Ceritinib \n\n(N=189) \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(N=187) \n\nProgression-free survival (based on BIRC)   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 89 (47.1) 113 (60.4) \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) 16.6 (12.6, 27.2) 8.1 (5.8, 11.1) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 0.55 (0.42, 0.73) \n\np-valueb <0.001 \n\nOverall survivalc   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 48 (25.4) 59 (31.6) \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) NE (29.3, NE) 26.2 (22.8, NE) \n\nOS rate at 24 monthsd, % (95% CI) 70.6 (62.2, 77.5) 58.2 (47.6, 67.5) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 0.73 (0.50,1.08) \n\np-valueb 0.056 \n\nTumour response (based on BIRC)   \n\nOverall response rate (95% CI) 72.5% (65.5, 78.7) 26.7% (20.5, 33.7) \n\nDuration of response (based on BIRC)   \n\nNumber of responders 137 50 \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) 23.9 (16.6, NE) 11.1 (7.8, 16.4) \n\nEvent-free rate at 18 monthsd, % (95% \n\nCI) \n\n59.0 (49.3, 67.4) 30.4 (14.1, 48.6) \n\nHR=hazard ratio;

The overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) was higher with ceritinib \n(72.7%, 95% CI: 49.8, 89.3) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (27.3%, 95% CI: 10.7, 50.2). \n\n \n\nThe median PFS by BIRC using RECIST 1.1 was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the \n\nchemotherapy arm in both subgroups of patients with brain metastases and without brain metastases. \n\nThe median PFS in patients with brain metastases was 10.7 months (95% CI: 8.1, 16.4) versus \n\n6.7 months (95% CI: 4.1, 10.6) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively, with HR=0.70 \n\n(95% CI: 0.44, 1.12). The median PFS in patients without brain metastases was 26.3 months (95% CI: \n\n15.4, 27.7) versus 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 13.7) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, \n\nrespectively, with HR=0.48 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.69). \n\n \n\nPreviously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2303 (ASCEND-5) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Zykadia for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients who \n\nhave received previous treatment with crizotinib, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, \n\nrandomised, open-label phase 3 Study A2303. \n\n \n\nA total of 231 patients with advanced ALK positive NSCLC who have received prior treatment with \n\ncrizotinib and chemotherapy (one or two regimen including a platinum-based doublet) were included \n\nin the analysis. One hundred fifteen (115) patients were randomised to Zykadia and one hundred \n\nsixteen (116) were randomised to chemotherapy (either pemetrexed or docetaxel). Seventy-three (73) \n\npatients received docetaxel and 40 received pemetrexed. In the ceritinib arm, 115 patients were treated \n\nwith 750 mg once daily fasted. The median age was 54.0 years (range: 28 to 84 years); 77.1% of \n\npatients were younger than 65 years. A total of 55.8% of patients were female. 64.5% of the study \n\npopulation were Caucasian, 29.4% Asian, 0.4% Black and 2.6% other races. The majority of patients \n\nhad adenocarcinoma (97.0%) and had either never smoked or were former smokers (96.1%). The \n\nECOG performance status was 0/1/2 in 46.3%/47.6%/6.1% of patients respectively, and 58.0% had \n\nbrain metastasis at baseline. All patients were treated with prior crizotinib. All except one patient \n\nreceived prior chemotherapy (including a platinum doublet) for advanced disease; 11.3% of the \n\npatients in the ceritinib arm and 12.1% of the patients in the chemotherapy arm were treated with two \n\nprior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. \n\n \n\nPatients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of \n\ncontinued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy \n\narm could further crossover to receive Zykadia upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed \n\nby BIRC. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months (from randomisation to data cut-off date). \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS by \n\nBIRC with an estimated 51% risk reduction in the ceritinib arm compared to chemotherapy arm (see \n\nTable 4 and Figure 3). The PFS benefit of Zykadia was consistent across various subgroups including \n\nage, gender, race, smoking class, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases or prior \n\nresponse to crizotinib. The PFS benefit was further supported by local investigator assessment, and \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nanalysis of overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). \n\n \n\nOS data was immature with 48 (41.7%) events in the ceritinib arm and 50 (43.1%) events in the \n\nchemotherapy arm, corresponding to approximately 50% of the required events for the final OS \n\nanalysis. In addition, 81 patients (69.8%) in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent Zykadia as \n\nfirst antineoplastic therapy after study treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nEfficacy data from Study A2303 are summarised in Table 4, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and \n\nOS are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively. \n\n \n\nTable 4 ASCEND-5 (Study A2303) – Efficacy results in patients with previously treated \n\nALK-positive metastatic/advanced NSCLC \n\n \n\n Ceritinib \n\n(N=115) \n\nChemotherapy \n\n(N=116) \n\nDuration of follow-up \n\nMedian (months) (min – max) \n\n16.5 \n\n(2.8 – 30.9) \n\nProgression-free survival (based on BIRC)   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 83 (72.2%) 89 (76.7%) \n\nMedian, months (95% CI) 5.4 (4.1, 6.9) 1.6 (1.4, 2.8) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 0.49 (0.36, 0.67) \n\np-valueb <0.001 \n\nOverall survivalc   \n\nNumber of events, n (%) 48 (41.7%) 50 (43.1%) \n\nMedian, months (95% CI) 18.1 (13.4, 23.9) 20.1 (11.9, 25.1) \n\nHR (95% CI)a 1.00 (0.67,1.49) \n\np-valueb 0.496 \n\nTumour responses (based on BIRC)   \n\nObjective response rate (95% CI) 39.1% (30.2, 48.7) 6.9% (3.0, 13.1) \n\nDuration of response   \n\nNumber of responders 45 8 \n\nMedian, monthsd (95% CI) 6.9 (5.4, 8.9) 8.3 (3.5, NE) \n\nEvent-free probability estimate at 9 \n\nmonthsd (95% CI) \n\n31.5% (16.7%, \n47.3%) \n\n45.7% (6.9%, 79.5%) \n\nHR=hazard ratio; CI=confidence interval; BIRC=Blinded Independent Review Committee; \n\nNE=not estimable \na Based on the stratified Cox proportional hazards analysis. \nb Based on the stratified log-rank test. \nc OS analysis was not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of cross over. \nd Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 ASCEND-5 (Study A2303) – Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival as \n\nassessed by BIRC \n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n \n\n   \n \n \n\n80 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n \n \n\n40 \n \n\n \n \n \n\n20 \n \n\n \n \n0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n No. of patients s till at risk \n\nTime (Months) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 \n\nCeritinib 750 mg 115 87 68 40 31 18 12 9 4 3 2 1 0 \n\nChemotherapy 116 45 26 12 9 6 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 \n\n \n\n        0        2        4        6        8       10       12      14      16       18       20      22       24 \n\nTime (Months) \n\n  \n \n\nCensoring Times \n\nCeritinib 750 mg (n/N = 83/115) \n\n  Chemotherapy (n/N = 89/116) \n \n\n \nHazard Ratio = 0.49 \n\n95% CI (0.36;0.67) \n\n \n\nKaplan-Meier medians (95% CI) (Months) \n\nCeritinib 750 mg: 5.4 (4.1;6.9) \n\nChemotherapy: 1.6 (1.4;2.8) \n\n \n\nLog rank p-value = <0.001 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n               \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nili\nty\n\n (\n%\n\n) \no\n\nf \ne\nv\ne\n\nn\nt-\n\nfr\ne\n\ne\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 4 ASCEND-5 (Study A2303) – Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival by treatment \n\narm \n\n \n\n100 \n \n \n \n \n\n80 \n \n \n \n \n\n60 \n \n \n \n \n\n40 \n \n \n \n \n\n20 \n \n \n\n \n\n0 \n \n \n \n\n0 2 4 6 \n\n \n \n \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n\n14 16 \n\n \n \n \n18 \n\n \n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n \n \n\n22 \n\n \n \n \n\n24 \n\n \n \n \n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n\n30 \n\n  \nNo. of patients s till at risk \n\n   Time (Months)        \n\nTime (Months) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 \n\nCeritinib 750 mg 115 107 92 83 71 61 52 37 28 23 13 8 2 2 0 0 \n\nChemotherapy 116 109 91 78 66 53 43 39 29 22 17 7 5 2 1 0 \n\n \n\nPatient reported outcome questionnaires were collected using the EORTC QLQ C30/LC13, LCSS and \n\nEQ-5D-5L. 75% or more of patients in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms completed the LCSS \n\nquestionnaires at most of the time points during the course of the study.

Of the 163 ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received prior treatment with an \n\nALK inhibitor, the median age was 52 years (range: 24-80 years); 86.5% were younger than 65 years \n\nand 54% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (66.3%) or Asian (28.8%). 93.3% had \n\nadenocarcinoma and 96.9% had either never been or were former smokers. All of the patients were \n\ntreated with at least one regimen prior to enrolment into the study and 84.0% with two or more \n\nregimens. \n\n \n\nStudy A2201 involved 140 patients who had been previously treated with 1-3 lines of cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy followed by treatment with crizotinib, and who had then progressed on crizotinib.

Oral absorption was estimated to be ≥25% based on metabolite percentages \n\nin the faeces. The absolute bioavailability of ceritinib has not been determined. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure of ceritinib was increased when administered with food. Ceritinib AUCinf values \n\nwere approximately 39% and 64% higher (Cmax approximately 42% and 58% higher) in healthy \n\nsubjects when a single 750 mg ceritinib dose (tablet) was administered with a low fat meal (containing \n\napproximately 330 kcalories and 9 grams of fat) and a high fat meal (containing approximately \n\n1000 kcalories and 58 grams of fat), respectively, as compared with the fasted state. \n\n \n\nIn a dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in patients comparing Zykadia 450 mg or 600 mg \n\ndaily with food (approximately 100 to 500 kcalories and 1.5 to 15 grams of fat) to 750 mg daily under \n\nfasted conditions (dose and food condition of administration initially authorised), there was no \n\nclinically meaningful difference in the systemic steady-state exposure of ceritinib for the 450 mg with \n\nfood arm (N=36) compared to the 750 mg fasted arm (N=31), with only small increases in steady-state \n\nAUC (90% CI) by 4% (-13%, 24%) and Cmax (90% CI) by 3% (-14%, 22%). In contrast, the \n\nsteady-state AUC (90% CI) and Cmax (90% CI) for the 600 mg with food arm (N=30) increased by \n\n24% (3%, 49%) and 25% (4%, 49%), respectively, compared to the 750 mg fasted arm. The maximum \n\nrecommended dose of Zykadia is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAfter single oral administration of ceritinib in patients, plasma exposure to ceritinib, as represented by \n\nCmax and AUClast, increased dose-proportionally over the 50 to 750 mg dose range under fasted \n\nconditions. In contrast with single-dose data, pre-dose concentration (Cmin) after repeated daily dosing \n\nappeared to increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBinding of ceritinib to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97% in a concentration \n\nindependent manner, from 50 ng/ml to 10,000 ng/ml. Ceritinib also has a slight preferential \n\ndistribution to red blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.35. \n\nIn vitro studies suggest that ceritinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not of breast cancer \n\nresistance protein (BCRP) or multi-resistance protein 2 (MRP2). The in vitro apparent passive \n\npermeability of ceritinib was determined to be low. \n\n \n\nIn rats, ceritinib crosses the intact blood brain barrier with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of \n\nabout 15%. There are no data related to brain-to-blood exposure ratio in humans. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance \n\nof ceritinib. \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral administration of radioactive ceritinib dose at 750 mg fasted, ceritinib was the \n\nmain circulating component in human plasma. A total of 11 metabolites were found circulating in \n\nplasma at low levels with mean contribution to the radioactivity AUC of ≤2.3% for each metabolite. \n\nMain biotransformation pathways identified in healthy subjects included mono-oxygenation, \n\nO-dealkylation, and N-formylation. Secondary biotransformation pathways involving the primary \n\nbiotransformation products included glucuronidation and dehydrogenation. Addition of a thiol group \n\nto O-dealkylated ceritinib was also observed. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing single oral doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions, the geometric mean apparent plasma \n\nterminal half-life (T½) of ceritinib ranged from 31 to 41 hours in patients over the 400 to 750 mg dose \n\nrange. Daily oral dosing of ceritinib results in achievement of steady-state by approximately 15 days \n\nand remains stable afterwards, with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 6.2 after 3 weeks of daily \n\ndosing. The geometric mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ceritinib was lower at steady-state \n\n(33.2 litres/hour) after 750 mg daily oral dosing than after a single 750 mg oral dose (88.5 litres/hour), \n\nsuggesting that ceritinib demonstrates non-linear pharmacokinetics over time. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nThe primary route of excretion of ceritinib and its metabolites is in the faeces. Recovery of unchanged \n\nceritinib in the faeces accounts for a mean 68% of an oral dose. Only 1.3% of the administered oral \n\ndose is recovered in the urine. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ceritinib (750 mg under \nfasted conditions) was evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A; N=8), moderate (Child-\n\nPugh class B; N=7), or severe (Child-Pugh class C; N=7) hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy subjects \n\nwith normal hepatic function. The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was \n\nincreased by 18% (35%) and 2% (22%) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, \n\nrespectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nThe geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was increased by 66% (108%) in subjects \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). A \n\ndedicated pharmacokinetic study under steady-state in patients with hepatic impairment has not been \n\nconducted. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. Based \n\non available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible (1.3% of a single oral administered \n\ndose). \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 345 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 \n\nto <90 ml/min), 82 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min) and 546 patients \n\nwith normal renal function (≥90 ml/min), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients with mild and \n\nmoderate renal impairment and normal renal function, suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary \n\nin patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr \n\n<30 ml/min) were not included in the clinical studies of Zykadia (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nEffects of age, gender, and race \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, gender and race had no clinically meaningful \n\ninfluence on ceritinib exposure. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nThe potential for QT interval prolongation of ceritinib was assessed in seven clinical studies with \n\nZykadia. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect \n\nof ceritinib on the QT interval in 925 patients treated with Zykadia 750 mg once daily fasted. A \n\ncategorical outlier analysis of ECG data demonstrated new QTc >500 msec in 12 patients (1.3%). \n\nThere were 58 patients (6.3%) with a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec. A central tendency \n\nanalysis of the QTc data at average steady-state concentration from Study A2301 demonstrated that \n\nthe upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QTc increase from baseline was 15.3 msec at Zykadia \n\n750 mg fasted. A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ceritinib causes concentration-dependent \n\nincreases in QTc (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies indicate that ceritinib is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of the \n\nrespiratory and central nervous systems. In vitro data show that the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of \n\nceritinib on the hERG potassium channel was 0.4 micromolar. An in vivo telemetry study in monkeys \n\nshowed a modest QT prolongation in 1 of 4 animals after receiving the highest dose of ceritinib. ECG \n\nstudies in monkeys after 4- or 13-weeks of dosing with ceritinib have not shown QT prolongation or \n\nabnormal ECGs. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nThe micronucleus test in TK6 cells was positive. No signs of mutagenicity or clastogenicity were \n\nobserved in other in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceritinib. Therefore, genotoxic risk is \n\nnot expected in humans. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology studies (i.e. embryo-foetal development studies) in pregnant rats and rabbits \n\nindicated no foetotoxicity or teratogenicity after dosing with ceritinib during organogenesis; however, \n\nmaternal plasma exposure was less than that observed at the recommended human dose. Formal \n\nnon-clinical studies on the potential effects of ceritinib on fertility have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nThe principal toxicity related to ceritinib administration in rats and monkeys was inflammation of the \n\nextra-hepatic bile ducts accompanied by increased neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Mixed \n\ncell/neutrophilic inflammation of the extra-hepatic ducts extended to the pancreas and/or duodenum at \n\nhigher doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in both species characterised by body weight loss, \n\ndecreased food consumption, emesis (monkey), diarrhoea and, at high doses, by histopathological \n\nlesions including erosion, mucosal inflammation and foamy macrophages in the duodenal crypts and \n\nsubmucosa. The liver was also affected in both species, at exposures that approximate clinical \n\nexposures at the recommended human dose, and included minimal increases in liver transaminases in \n\na few animals and vacuolation of the intra-hepatic bile duct epithelium. Alveolar foamy macrophages \n\n(confirmed phospholipidosis) were seen in the lungs of rats, but not in monkeys, and the lymph nodes \n\nof rats and monkeys had macrophage aggregates. Target organ effects showed partial to complete \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n\nEffects on the thyroid were observed in both rat (mild increases in thyroid stimulating hormone and \n\ntriiodothyronine/thyroxine T3/T4 concentrations with no microscopic correlate) and monkey \n\n(depletion of colloid in males in 4-week study, and one monkey at high dose with diffuse follicular \n\ncell hyperplasia and increased thyroid stimulating hormone in 13-week study). As these non-clinical \n\neffects were mild, variable and inconsistent, the relationship between ceritinib and thyroid gland \n\nchanges in animals is unclear. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Zykadia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Zykadia is \n\nZykadia is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ceritinib. It is used to treat adults with \n\nadvanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zykadia is only \n\ngiven to patients whose disease is due to a defect in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). \n\n \n\nHow Zykadia works \n\nIn patients with ALK defects, an abnormal protein is produced that stimulates the growth of the cancer \n\ncells. Zykadia blocks the action of this abnormal protein and thus slows down the growth and spread \n\nof NSCLC. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Zykadia works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Zykadia \n\n \n\nDo not take Zykadia: \n\n if you are allergic to ceritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zykadia: \n\n if you have problems with your liver. \n\n if you have problems with your lungs or problems breathing. \n\n if you have problems with your heart, including reduced heart rate, or if the results of an \nelectrocardiogram (ECG) have shown that you have an abnormality of the electrical activity of \n\nyour heart known as “prolonged QT interval”. \n\n if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n if you have problems with your pancreas. \n\n if you are currently taking steroids. \n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you get any of the following signs or symptoms during \n\ntreatment with Zykadia: \n\n tiredness, itchy skin, yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, nausea (feeling sick) or \nvomiting, decreased appetite, pain on the right side of your abdomen (belly), dark or brown \n\nurine, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. These may be signs or symptoms of liver \n\nproblems. \n\n new or worsening cough with or without mucus, fever, chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness \nof breath. These may be symptoms of lung problems. \n\n chest pain or discomfort, changes in your heartbeat (fast or slow), light-headedness, fainting, \ndizziness, blue discoloration of your lips, shortness of breath, swelling of your lower limbs or \n\nskin. These may be signs or symptoms of heart problems. \n\n severe diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. These are symptoms of digestive problems. \n\n excessive thirst or increased frequency of urination. These may be symptoms of a high level of \nsugar in the blood. \n\nYour doctor may need to adjust your treatment or stop Zykadia temporarily or permanently. \n\n \n\nBlood tests during treatment with Zykadia \n\nYour doctor should perform blood tests before you start treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three \n\nmonths of treatment and monthly therafter. The purpose of these tests is to check your liver function. \n\nYour doctor should also perform blood tests to check the functioning of your pancreas and the level of \n\nsugar in your blood before you start treatment with Zykadia and regularly during treatment. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Zykadia in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Zykadia \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription such as vitamins or herbal \n\nsupplements, because they might interact with Zykadia. It is particularly important that you mention \n\nany of the following medicines. \n\n \n\nMedicines which may increase the risk of side effects with Zykadia: \n\n medicines used to treat AIDS/HIV (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir). \n\n medicines used to treat infections. These include medicines that treat fungal infections \n(antifungals such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) and medicines that \n\ntreat certain types of bacterial infection (antibiotics such as telithromycin). \n\n \n\nThe following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of Zykadia: \n\n St. John’s Wort, a herbal medicine used to treat depression. \n\n medicines used to stop seizures or fits (anti-epileptics such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or \nphenobarbital). \n\n medicines used to treat tuberculosis (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin). \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nZykadia may increase the side effects associated with the following medicines: \n\n medicines used to treat irregular heartbeat or other heart problems (e.g. amiodarone, \ndisopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide and digoxin). \n\n medicines used to treat stomach problems (e.g. cisapride). \n\n medicines used to treat mental health problems (e.g. haloperidol, droperidol, pimozide). \n\n medicines used to treat depression (e.g. nefazodone). \n\n midazolam, a medicine used to treat acute seizures or as a sedative before or during surgery or \nmedical procedures. \n\n warfarin and dabigatran, medicines used to prevent blood clots. \n\n diclofenac, a medicine used to treat joint pain and inflammation. \n\n alfentanil and fentanyl, medicines used to treat severe pain. \n\n ciclosporin, sirolimus and tacrolimus, medicines used in organ transplantation to prevent \ntransplant organ rejection. \n\n dihydroergotamine and ergotamine, medicines used to treat migraine. \n\n domperidone, a medicine used to treat nausea and vomiting. \n\n moxifloxacin and clarithromycin, medicines used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n methadone, a medicine used to treat pain and for the treatment of opioid dependence. \n\n chloroquine and halofantrine, medicines used to treat malaria. \n\n topotecan, a medicine used to treat certain types of cancer. \n\n colchicine, a medicine used to treat gout. \n\n pravastatine and rosuvastatine, medicines used to reduce cholesterol levels. \n\n sulfasalazine, a medicine used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. \n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nThese medicines should be used with care or may need to be avoided during your treatment with \n\nZykadia. If you are taking any of these, your doctor might need to prescribe an alternative medicine \n\nfor you. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Zykadia and you are prescribed a new \n\nmedicine that you have not already taken at the same time as Zykadia. \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nIf you take Zykadia whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may become ineffective. \n\n \n\nZykadia with food and drink \n\nYou should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice during treatment. It may make the amount of \n\nZykadia in your blood increase to a harmful level. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou must use a highly effective method of birth control during treatment with Zykadia and for \n\n3 months after stopping treatment. Talk to your doctor about the birth control methods that may be \n\nright for you. \n\n \n\nZykadia is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential \n\nrisk to the baby. If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or plan to become pregnant, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Zykadia during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nZykadia should not be used during breast-feeding. You and your doctor will decide together whether \n\nyou should breast-feed or take Zykadia. You should not do both. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou should take special care when driving and using machines when taking Zykadia as you may \n\nexperience visual disturbances or tiredness. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Zykadia \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

What Zykadia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Zykadia is \n\nZykadia is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ceritinib. It is used to treat adults with \n\nadvanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zykadia is only \n\ngiven to patients whose disease is due to a defect in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). \n\n \n\nHow Zykadia works \n\nIn patients with ALK defects, an abnormal protein is produced that stimulates the growth of the cancer \n\ncells. Zykadia blocks the action of this abnormal protein and thus slows down the growth and spread \n\nof NSCLC. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Zykadia works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.
