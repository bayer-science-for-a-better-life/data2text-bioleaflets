NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFoclivia suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)* of strain: \n \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms** \nper 0.5 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens’ eggs from healthy chicken flocks \n** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin. \n \nAdjuvant MF59C.1 containing: \nSqualene 9.75 milligrams \nPolysorbate 80 1.175 milligrams \nSorbitan trioleate 1.175 milligrams \nSodium citrate 0.66 milligrams \nCitric acid 0.04 milligrams \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and elderly: 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults aged (18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n \nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \nof eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may \nbe appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available \nin case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and \nto eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nFoclivia should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or subcutaneously. Therefore, \nhealthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in \nindividuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular \ninjection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). \n \nSome cross-protection was observed against related H5N1 virus variants in clinical trials \n(see section 5.1). \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or \nefficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data is available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response \nto the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with \nanother vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted \nthat the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo data have been generated with Foclivia in pregnant women. \n \nSafety data are available, however, in pregnant women exposed to Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic \nvaccine similar to Foclivia) which contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Postmarketing \nspontaneously reported adverse events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect \nharmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies \ndesigned to assess the safety of Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of \ngestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, \nand congenital malformations among almost 10.000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring \ncompared with unvaccinated controls. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe vaccine may be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nAdults and elderly (above 18 years old). \nFrom the clinical trials conducted with the pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine in adult \nand elderly (see section 5.1 for more information), most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short \nduration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines.  \nIt is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated  \nwith a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, \nnonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second dose compared with \nthe first. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nChildren and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years: \nIn a phase II clinical trial (Study V87P6) safety of a pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine \nwas evaluated in children and adolescent (see section 5.1 for more information). \n \nRegardless of age, reactogenicity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after a third dose, administered 12 months after the second dose, was higher than after \nboth first and second dose. The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in the \nolder age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema and tenderness were \nthe most commonly reported solicited local reactions; irritability and unusual crying were the most \ncommonly reported solicited systemic reactions. In children and adolescents pain was the most \nfrequently reported solicited local reaction, and fatigue and headache were the most commonly \nreported solicited systemic reactions. Across all ages, low percentages of subjects reported fever. \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents with a similar pandemic vaccine \n(Focetria H1N1v) suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the aH5N1 pandemic \npreparedness vaccine formulation (Foclivia). \n \nFrequency of Adverse reactions in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance is reported hereunder. \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated in four clinical trials with different influenza strains \nand formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1); 3696 adults and elderly subjects were exposed. Of these \nsubjects, 3618 subjects received the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia (A/H5N1) (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia are listed \nbelow. \n \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): headache \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): sweating \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): arthralgia and myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): injection site redness, injection site swelling, injection site induration, \ninjection site ecchymosis and injection site pain, fever, malaise, fatigue and shivering \n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant \n(n=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (n=137). \n \n\n First dose \nSecond dose (21 days \n\nafter first dose) \nThird dose (12 months \n\nafter second dose) \nH5N1 adjuvanted vaccine \n\nToddlers (6-<36 months) N=145 N=138 N=124 \nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0% 0% 0%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 54% 49% 35% \n\nChildren (3-<9 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 36% 31% 19% \n\nAdolescents(9-<18 years) N=93 N=91 N=83 \nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 30% 27% 22% \n \nFocetria (H1N1v) \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from 77 children 3-8 years \nold and 80 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported \nas follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N= 77 N= 75 \nAny adverse reaction  74%  69% \nLocal  62%  56% \nSystemic  39%  35% \nFever ≥ 38°C to 38.9°C  4% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  14%  17% \n\nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N= 80 N= 79 \nAny adverse reaction  79%  66% \nLocal  70%  58% \nSystemic  45%  30% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  3% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 0% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  13%  10% \n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from \n73 infants 6-11 months old and 73 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were \nreported as follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N= 73 N= 68 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44%  26% \nSystemic  70%  56% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C   11%  9% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C  3% 4% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  32%  31% \n\nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N= 73 N= 71 \nAny adverse reaction 70%  71% \nLocal  51%  49% \nSystemic  60%  49% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  10% 11% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 4% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21%  24% \n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 146 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting and change in eating \nhabits.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the H5N1 pandemic preparedness vaccines \nfollowing a two-dose administration of 7.5 microgram. \n \nPandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the \ncurrently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and \nsimulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data \nobtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be \nused for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic \npreparednessvaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. \n \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nA Phase II clinical trial (Study V87P1) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with \nMF59C.1 adjuvant in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing \nH5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HemoAgglutinin (HA)/dose adjuvanted) were administered \nthree weeks apart to 156 subjects. \n \nIn another clinical trial (Phase III) (Study V87P13), 2693 healthy adults were enrolled and received two \ndoses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) administered \nthree weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (n=197) of the study population. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adults measured by Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) assay was \nas follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=149 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=197 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 85% (79-91) 91% (87-95) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 85% (78-90) 78% (72-84) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 7.74 (6.6-9.07) 4.03 (3.54-4.59) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=69 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=128 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 94% (88-97) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 73% (65-81) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.87 (7.09-11) 2.71 (2.38-3.08) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nMicroNeutralization (MN) results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and \nseroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% (58-72) to 83% (77-89), \nrespectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained \nwith SRH. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by \nHemagglutination Inhibition (HI), SRH, and MN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained at \nday 43 after completion of primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced \nby 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged over 60 (limited number of subjects were \nabove 70 years of age) measured by SRH assay assessed in two clinical studies were as follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=84 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=210 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 80% (70-88) 82% (76-87) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 70% (59-80) 63% (56-69) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 4.96 (3.87-6.37) 2.9 (2.53-3.31) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=66 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=143 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 82% (75-88) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 54% (45-62) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.58 (6.57-11) 1.91 (1.72-2.12) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nMN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging \nfrom of 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) respectively. MN results, \nsimilar to SRH results demonstrated strong immune response after completion of priming vaccination \nseries in a population of elderly subjects. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN \ntests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5th of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after \ncompletion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% of the elderly \nsubjects immunised with H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C were seroprotected at six months. \n \nBooster dose \n \nA third (booster) dose of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C was administered 6 months onwards \nafter the primary vaccination series. Results are shown by SRH. \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 measured by SRH assays were as follows: \n \n Study V87P1 Adults \n\nBooster (6 months after 2nd dose\n) \n\nStudy V87P1 Elderly \nBooster (6 months after 2nd dos\n\ne) \nSRH N=71 N=38 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 89% (79-95) 84% (69-94) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 83% (72-91) 63% (46-78) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)*\n* \n\n5.96 (4.72-7.53) 5.15 (3.46-7.66) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nThere is limited experience for the booster dose in the elderly population. \n \n• Supportive data in adult and elderly populations \n \nIn two dose finding studies 78 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparednessvaccine (H5N3 or \nH9N2). Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages \n(7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. \n \nSerum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates. \n \nSerologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved \nseroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 µg injections. The adjuvanted vaccine was also \nfound to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated in 2003 and 2004, \nwhich exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. \n \nTwo doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages \n(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart. Serologic responses obtained \nwith the HI assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% seroconverted after \ntwo 7.5 µg injections. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nCross reactivity \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nSeroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibodies \nto H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/05 after the 2nd dose in adults 18-60 years of age, measured by SRH and \nHI assays were as follows: \n \n\n Anti-HA antibody \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose  \nN=70 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose  \n\nN=197 \n\nSRH \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 70% (58-80) 59% (52-66) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* NA*** 49% (42-56) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** NA*** 2.37 (2.1-2.67) \n\n  N=69 N=197 \n\nHI \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)° 36%(25-49) 23% (18-30) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)° NA*** 19% (14-25) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)°° NA*** 1.92 (1.64-2.25) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n° measured by HI assay ≥ 40 \n°° geometric mean ratios of HI \n*** In V87P1: baseline not tested \n \nMN results for the clinical studies in the Table above revealed a seroprotection rate against \nA/turkey/Turkey/05 ranging from 27% (17-39) (V87P1) to 39% (32-46) (V87P13) and seroconversion \nrate of 36% (29-43) for study V87P13.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and elderly: 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults (18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n \nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1) \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass).. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues of \neggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may \nbe appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available \nin case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and \nto eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nFoclivia should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or subcutaneously. Therefore, \nhealthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in \nindividuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular \ninjection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). \n \nSome cross-protection was observed against related H5N1 virus variants in clinical trials \n(see section 5.1). \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity \nor efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data is available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \n\n\n\n17 \n\ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with \nanother vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted \nthat the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo data have been generated with Foclivia in pregnant women. \n \nSafety data are available, however, in pregnant women exposed to Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic \nvaccine similar to Foclivia) which contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Postmarketing \nspontaneously reported adverse events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect \nharmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies \ndesigned to assess the safety of Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of \ngestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, \nand congenital malformations among almost 10.000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring \ncompared with unvaccinated controls. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe vaccine may be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nAdults and elderly (above 18 years old). \nFrom the clinical trials conducted with the pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine in adult \nand elderly (see section 5.1 for more information), most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short \nduration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is \nwidely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated with a \nslightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, \nnonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second dose compared with \nthe first. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years: \nIn a phase II clinical trial (Study V87P6) safety of a pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine \nwas evaluated in children and adolescent (see section 5.1 for more information). \n \nRegardless of age, reactogenicity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after a third dose, administered 12 months after the second dose, was higher than after \nboth first and second dose. The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in the \nolder age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema and tenderness were \nthe most commonly reported solicited local reactions; irritability and unusual crying were the most \ncommonly reported solicited systemic reactions. In children and adolescents pain was the most \nfrequently reported solicited local reaction, and fatigue and headache were the most commonly \nreported solicited systemic reactions. Across all ages, low percentages of subjects reported fever. \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents with a similar pandemic vaccine \n(Focetria H1N1v) suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the aH5N1 pandemic \npreparedness vaccine formulation (Foclivia). \n \nFrequency of Adverse reactions in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance is reported hereunder. \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated in four clinical trials with different influenza strains \nand formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1); 3696 adults and elderly subjects were exposed. Of these \nsubjects, 3618 subjects received the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia (A/H5N1) (see \nsection 5.1) \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia are listed \nbelow. \n \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): headache \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): sweating \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): arthralgia and myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): injection site redness, injection site swelling, injection site induration, \ninjection site ecchymosis and injection site pain, fever, malaise, fatigue and shivering \n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant \n(n=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (n=137). \n \n\n \nInjection 1 Injection 2 Injection 3 \n\nH5N1 adjuvanted \nvaccine \n\nH5N1 adjuvanted \nvaccine \n\nH5N1 adjuvanted \nvaccine \n\nToddlers (6-<36 months) N=145 N=138 N=124 \nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0% 0% 0%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 54% 49% 35% \n\nChildren (3-<9 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 36% 31% 19% \nAdolescents(9-<18 years) N=93 N=91 N=83 \nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 30% 27% 22% \n \nFocetria (H1N1v) \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from 77 children 3-8 years \nold and 80 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as \nfollows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N= 77 N= 75 \nAny adverse reaction  74%  69% \nLocal  62%  56% \nSystemic  39%  35% \nFever ≥ 38°C to 38.9°C  4% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  14%  17% \n\nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N= 80 N= 79 \nAny adverse reaction  79%  66% \nLocal  70%  58% \nSystemic  45%  30% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  3% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 0% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  13%  10% \n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from \n73 infants 6-11 months old and 73 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were \nreported as follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N= 73 N= 68 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44%  26% \nSystemic  70%  56% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  11%  9% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C  3% 4% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  32%  31% \n\nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N= 73 N= 71 \nAny adverse reaction 70%  71% \nLocal  51%  49% \nSystemic  60%  49% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  10% 11% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 4% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21%  24% \n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 146 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting and change in eating \nhabits. Induration and ecchymosis were very common reaction in toddlers but were less common in \ninfants. \n \n• Post-marketing surveillance \n \nIn addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, the following have been reported \nduring post-marketing experience with Focetria H1N1v: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nMuscoskeletal and connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCough. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope. Neurological disorders, such as neuralgia, paraesthesia, \nconvulsions and neuritis. \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions, anaphylaxis including dyspnoea, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, in rare cases \nleading to shock. \n \nFrom Post-marketing surveillance with adjuvanted interpandemic trivalent vaccines with composition \nsimilar to that of Foclivia (an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine), the following additional \nadverse reactions have been reported: \n \nRare (>1/10,000, <1/1,000): \nThrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts less than 5,000 per mm3). \n \nVery rare (<1/10,000): \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement and exudative erythema multiforme. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nAdverse event(s) from post-marketing surveillance with the pandemic vaccine: not applicable. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the H5N1 pandemic preparedness vaccines \nfollowing a two-dose administration of 7.5 microgram. \n \nPandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the \ncurrently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and \nsimulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data \nobtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be \nused for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness \nvaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. \n \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nA Phase II clinical trial (Study V87P1) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 \nadjuvant in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg \nHemoAgglutinin (HA)/dose adjuvanted) were administered three weeks apart to 156 subjects. \n \nIn another clinical trial (Phase III) (Study V87P13), 2693 healthy adults were enrolled and received two \ndoses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) administered \nthree weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (n=197) of the study population. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adults measured by Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) assay was \nas follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=149 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=197 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 85% (79-91) 91% (87-95) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 85% (78-90) 78% (72-84) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 7.74 (6.6-9.07) 4.03 (3.54-4.59) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=69 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=128 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 94% (88-97) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 73% (65-81) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.87 (7.09-11) 2.71 (2.38-3.08) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nMicroNeutralization (MN) results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and \nseroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% (58-72) to 83% (77-89), \nrespectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained \nwith SRH. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by \nHemagglutination Inhibition (HI), SRH, and MN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained at \nday 43 after completion of primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced \nby 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged over 60 (limited number of subjects were \nabove 70 years of age) measured by SRH assay assessed in two clinical studies were as follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=84 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=210 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 80% (70-88) 82% (76-87) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 70% (59-80) 63% (56-69) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 4.96 (3.87-6.37) 2.9 (2.53-3.31) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=66 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=143 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 82% (75-88) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 54% (45-62) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.58 (6.57-11) 1.91 (1.72-2.12) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nMN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging \nfrom of 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) respectively. MN results, \nsimilar to SRH results demonstrated strong immune response after completion of priming vaccination \nseries in a population of elderly subjects. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN \ntests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5th of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after \ncompletion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% of the elderly \nsubjects immunised with H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C were seroprotected at six months. \n \nBooster dose \n \nA third (booster) dose of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C was administered 6 months onwards \nafter the primary vaccination series. Results are shown by SRH. \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 measured by SRH assays were as follows: \n \n\n \nStudy V87P1 Adults \n\nBooster (6 months after 2nd dose\n) \n\nStudy V87P1 Elderly \nBooster (6 months after 2nd dos\n\ne) \nSRH N=71 N=38 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 89% (79-95) 84% (69-94) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 83% (72-91) 63% (46-78) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)*\n* \n\n5.96 (4.72-7.53) 5.15 (3.46-7.66) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nThere is limited experience for the booster dose in the elderly population. \n \n• Supportive data in adult and elderly populations \n \nIn two dose finding studies 78 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N3 or \nH9N2). Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages \n(7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. \n \nSerum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates. \n \nSerologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved \nseroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 µg injections. The adjuvanted vaccine was also \nfound to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated in 2003 and 2004, \nwhich exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. \n \nTwo doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages \n(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and elderly: 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults (18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \nof eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may \nbe appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available \nin case of need. See section 4.4 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \nthiomersal and to eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nFoclivia should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or subcutaneously. Therefore, \nhealthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in \nindividuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular \ninjection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). \n \nSome cross-protection was observed against related H5N1 virus variants in clinical trials \n(see section 5.1). \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity \nor efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data is available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with \nanother vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted \nthat the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo data have been generated with Foclivia in pregnant women. \n \nSafety data are available, however, in pregnant women exposed to Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic \nvaccine similar to Foclivia which contains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Postmarketing \nspontaneously reported adverse events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect \nharmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies \ndesigned to assess the safety of Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of \ngestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, \nand congenital malformations among almost 10.000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring \ncompared with unvaccinated controls. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe vaccine may be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nAdults and elderly (above 18 years old). \nFrom the clinical trials conducted with the pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine in adult \nand elderly (see section 5.1 for more information), most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short \nduration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is \nwidely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated with \na slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, \n\n\n\n31 \n\nnonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second dose compared with \nthe first. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years: \nIn a phase II clinical trial (Study V87P6) safety of a pandemic preparedness adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine \nwas evaluated in children and adolescent (see section 5.1 for more information). \n \nRegardless of age, reactogenicity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after a third dose, administered 12 months after the second dose, was higher than after \nboth first and second dose. The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in the \nolder age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema and tenderness were \nthe most commonly reported solicited local reactions; irritability and unusual crying were the most \ncommonly reported solicited systemic reactions. In children and adolescents pain was the most \nfrequently reported solicited local reaction, and fatigue and headache were the most commonly \nreported solicited systemic reactions. Across all ages, low percentages of subjects reported fever. \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents with a similar pandemic vaccine \n(Focetria H1N1v) suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the aH5N1 pandemic \npreparedness vaccine formulation (Foclivia). \n \nFrequency of Adverse reactions in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance is reported hereunder. \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated in four clinical trials with different influenza strains \nand formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1); 3696 adults and elderly subjects were exposed. Of these \nsubjects, 3618 subjects received the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia (A/H5N1) (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the pandemic preparedness vaccine Foclivia are listed \nbelow. \n \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): headache \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): sweating \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): arthralgia and myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon (>1/100, <1/10): injection site redness, injection site swelling, injection site induration, \ninjection site ecchymosis and injection site pain, fever, malaise, fatigue and shivering \n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant \n(n=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (n=137). \n \n\n First dose \nSecond dose (21 days \nafter the first dose) \n\nThird dose \n(12 months after the \n\nsecond dose) \nH5N1 adjuvanted vaccine \n\nToddlers (6-<36 months) N=145 N=138 N=124 \nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0% 0% 0%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 54% 49% 35% \n\nChildren (3-<9 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 36% 31% 19% \nAdolescents(9-<18 years) N=93 N=91 N=83 \nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever ≥ 38°C (≥ 40°C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 30% 27% 22% \n \nFocetria (H1N1v) \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from 77 children 3-8 years \nold and 80 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as \nfollows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N= 77 N= 75 \nAny adverse reaction  74%  69% \nLocal  62%  56% \nSystemic  39%  35% \nFever ≥ 38°C to 38.9°C  4% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  14%  17% \n\nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N= 80 N= 79 \nAny adverse reaction  79%  66% \nLocal  70%  58% \nSystemic  45%  30% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  3% 1% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 0% 0% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  13%  10% \n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from \n73 infants 6-11 months old and 73 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were \nreported as follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \n\nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N= 73 N= 68 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44%  26% \nSystemic  70%  56% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C   11%  9% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C  3% 4% \nFever ≥ 40° C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  32%  31% \n\nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N= 73 N= 71 \nAny adverse reaction 70%  71% \nLocal  51%  49% \nSystemic  60%  49% \nFever ≥38°C to 38.9°C  10% 11% \nFever 39°C to 39.9°C 4% 1% \nFever ≥ 40° C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21%  24% \n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 146 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting and change in eating \nhabits.

Neurological disorders, such as neuralgia, paraesthesia, \nconvulsions and neuritis. \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions, anaphylaxis including dyspnoea, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, in rare cases \nleading to shock. \n \nFrom Post-marketing surveillance with adjuvanted interpandemic trivalent vaccines with composition \nsimilar to Foclivia (an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine), the following additional adverse \nreactions have been reported: \n \nRare (>1/10,000, <1/1,000): \nThrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts less than 5.000 per mm3). \n \nVery rare (<1/10,000): \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement and exudative erythema multiforme. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nAdverse event(s) from post-marketing surveillance with the pandemic vaccine: not applicable. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the H5N1 pandemic preparedness vaccines \nfollowing a two-dose administration of 7.5 microgram. \n \nPandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the \ncurrently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and \nsimulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data \nobtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be \nused for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness \nvaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. \n \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nA Phase II clinical trial (Study V87P1) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 \nadjuvant in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg \nHemoAgglutinin (HA)/dose adjuvanted) were administered three weeks apart to 156 subjects. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIn another clinical trial (Phase III) (Study V87P13), 2693 healthy adults were enrolled and received \ntwo doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) \nadministered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (n=197) of the study \npopulation. \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adults measured by Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) assay was \nas follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=149 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=197 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 85% (79-91) 91% (87-95) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 85% (78-90) 78% (72-84) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 7.74 (6.6-9.07) 4.03 (3.54-4.59) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=69 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=128 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 94% (88-97) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 73% (65-81) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.87 (7.09-11) 2.71 (2.38-3.08) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nMicroNeutralization (MN) results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and \nseroconversion rate ranging from 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% (58-72) to 83% (77-89), \nrespectively. Immune response to vaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained \nwith SRH. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by \nHemagglutination Inhibition (HI), SRH, and MN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained \nat day 43 after completion of primary vaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced \nby 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged over 60 (limited number of subjects were \nabove 70 years of age) measured by SRH assay assessed in two clinical studies were as follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=84 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=210 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 80% (70-88) 82% (76-87) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 70% (59-80) 63% (56-69) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 4.96 (3.87-6.37) 2.9 (2.53-3.31) \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P13 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=66 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=143 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 82% (75-88) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 54% (45-62) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.58 (6.57-11) 1.91 (1.72-2.12) \n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nMN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging \nfrom of 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) respectively. MN results, \nsimilar to SRH results demonstrated strong immune response after completion of priming vaccination \nseries in a population of elderly subjects. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN \ntests reduced from 1/2 to 1/5th of their post-vaccination level at day 202 as compared to day 43 after \ncompletion of primary schedules as assessed by HI, SRH, and MN tests. Up to 50% of the elderly \nsubjects immunised with H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C were seroprotected at six months. \n \nBooster dose \n \nA third (booster) dose of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C was administered 6 months onwards \nafter the primary vaccination series. Results are shown by SRH. \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 measured by SRH assays were as follows: \n \n\n \nStudy V87P1 Adults \n\nBooster (6 months after 2nd dose\n) \n\nStudy V87P1 Elderly \nBooster (6 months after 2nd dos\n\ne) \nSRH N=71 N=38 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 89% (79-95) 84% (69-94) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 83% (72-91) 63% (46-78) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)*\n* 5.96 (4.72-7.53) 5.15 (3.46-7.66) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nThere is limited experience of the booster dose in the elderly population. \n \n• Supportive data in adult and elderly populations \n \nIn two dose finding studies 78 adults received an adjuvanted pandemic preparednessvaccine (H5N3 or \nH9N2). \nTwo doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/Duck/Singapore/97) strain at 3 different dosages \n(7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose) were administered three weeks apart. \n \nSerum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates. \n \nSerologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved \nseroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 µg injections. The adjuvanted vaccine was also \nfound to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated in 2003 and 2004, \nwhich exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains. \n \nTwo doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97) strain at 4 different dosages \n(3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/dose), were administered four weeks apart. Serologic responses obtained \nwith the HI assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% seroconverted after \ntwo 7.5 µg injections. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nCross reactivity \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nSeroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibodies to \nH5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/05 after the 2nd dose in adults 18-60 years of age, measured by SRH and HI \nassays were as follows: \n \n\n Anti-HA antibody \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose  \nN=70 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose  \n\nN=197 \n\nSRH \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 70% (58-80) 59% (52-66) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* NA*** 49% (42-56) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** NA*** 2.37 (2.1-2.67) \n\n  N=69 N=197 \n\nHI \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)° 36%(25-49) 23% (18-30) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)° NA*** 19% (14-25) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)°° NA*** 1.92 (1.64-2.25) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n° measured by HI assay ≥ 40 \n°° geometric mean ratios of HI \n*** In V87P1: baseline not tested \n \nMN results for the clinical studies in the Table above revealed a seroprotection rate against \nA/turkey/Turkey/05 ranging from 27% (17-39) (V87P1) to 39% (32-46) (V87P13) and seroconversion \nrate of 36% (29-43) for V87P13 study.

However, the relevance for clinical protection is \nunknown. \n\n \nMN results against a A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection rate of 99% (95%CI: 94-100), \na seroconversion rate ranging from 97% (95%CI: 91-99) to 99% (95%CI: 96-100) and a GMR ranging \nfrom 29 (95%CI: 25-35) to 50 (95%CI: 44-58). \n \nImmunogenicity results with Focetria H1N1v (Study V111_03): \nThe seroprotection rate and seroconversion rate measured by HI assay and the seroconversion factor \nexpressed as geometric mean ratios of HI for anti-HA antibody to H1N1 after administration of one \nand two 7.5 µg doses of Focetria was evaluated in 70 children and adolescents \n(9-17 years), 60 children (3-8 years), 58 children (12-35 months) and 49 infants (6-11 months). CHMP \nimmunogenicity criteria set for adults (18-60 years) were met both after the 1st and the 2nd dose in all \nthe above age strata (both in the overall population and in the subset seronegative at baseline). \n \nThe European medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFoclivia in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in active immunisation against \nH5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nFoclivia has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. \nThis means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product.

CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE \n \nMedicinal product subject to medical prescription. \n \nFoclivia can only be marketed when there is an official WHO/EU declaration of an influenza \npandemic, on the condition that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Foclivia takes due account \nof the officially declared pandemic strain. \n \n• Official batch release \n \nIn accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken \nby a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. \n \n \nC. OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING  \n\nAUTHORISATION \n \n• Periodic Safety Update Reports \n \nThe requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set \nout in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive \n2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. \n \nOutside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with \na specific review of AESI and possible adverse events related to adjuvants. This should include data \nfrom ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, of the pandemic preparedness strains and any safety \ndata relevant to the adjuvant system. \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring \nof the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic. Moreover, a 6-monthly cycle \nmay be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are \nexpected within a short period of time. Therefore, 6-monthly or annual PSURs falling within the \n\n\n\n43 \n\npandemic period will be replaced by monthly “simplified PSURs” (S-PSUR) accompanied by \na summary of vaccine distribution. \n \n• Frequency of submission: \n \n- The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n- First data-lock point is 30 days later. \n- S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45. \n- Rapporteur’s assessment report is circulated to CHMP members on Day 50. \n- CHMP report is circulated to the vaccine manufacturer on Day 55. \n- Reporting to be monthly for the first 6 months. \n- Periodicity should be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6 monthly intervals. \n \nWhen it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering \nthe period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to \nbe agreed with the Rapporteur. \n \n• Format of the simplified PSUR: \n \nOnly spontaneously reported data should be included in the PSUR. The report should include the \nfollowing Tables of aggregate data (using the pre-defined templates attached in Annex 2). \n \n\n1. An overview for all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of report \n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by \nthe report and cumulatively. \n\n \n2. An overview for all spontaneous adverse reactions by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) and \n\nPreferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or \nnon-medically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period covered by \nthe report and cumulatively. \n\n \n3. Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed \n\nor non-medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows: \n \n\n- Neuritis: PT “Neuritis” \n- Convulsion: narrow SMQ “Convulsions” \n- Anaphylaxis: narrow SMQ “Anaphylactic reaction” and narrow SMQ \n\n“Angioedema” \n- Encephalitis: narrow SMQ “Non-infectious encephalitis” \n- Vasculitis: narrow SMQ “Vasculitis” \n- Guillain-Barré narrow SMQ “Guillain-Barré syndrome” \n\nsyndrome: \n- Demyelination: narrow SMQ “Demyelination” (as GBS is also included in this \n\nSMQ, there will be an overlap in the number of cases for these \ntwo categories). \n\n- Bell’s palsy: PT “Bell’s palsy” \n- Vaccination failure: PT “Vaccination failure”. \n\n \n4. Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PTs) stratified according to type of report \n\n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report and \ncumulatively. \n\n \n5. All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC, HLT and PT, stratified according \n\nto type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered \nby the report and cumulatively. The following age groups will be used: < 2 years, 2-8 years, \n> 9 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n6. All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PT) occurring in pregnant women, stratified \naccording to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period \ncovered by the report and cumulatively. \n\n \nThe following principles should be followed when compiling the data: \n \n- Except for Table 1, all tables will be based on number of reactions (presented on PT level, \n\nsorted by System Organ Class [SOC] and High Level Term [HLT]) and not number of cases. \n- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data1. Product-specific data can be \n\nevaluated during signal work-up. \n- “Cumulatively” means since the use of the vaccine; events not reported during the period of \n\ninterest should not be presented in the tables. \n- All non-medically confirmed events are those that have been entered into the database by the \n\ndata-lock point. Those which have not yet been entered should be reported in the following \nS-PSUR. \n\n- A line listing of fatal cases will be provided in an Annex. \n \nA short summary should be provided in which validated signals and areas of concern are highlighted, \ntaking into account information arising from the prospective cohort study described in 4.5.

What Foclivia is and what it is used for \n \nFoclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nIt has to be used in adults (from 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years) to prevent flu caused \nby the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n \nFoclivia should not be given if you: \n- have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of Foclivia, \n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, \n- are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, \n- are allergic to any antibiotic, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and \n\npolysorbate 80. \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \n- if you feel feverish, \n- if you have any illness or infection, \n- if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for \n\ncancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency \nconditions). \n\n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have \nhad previous history of epilepsy. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse \nif you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Foclivia \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. Foclivia should not be given at the same time as \nother vaccines (if another vaccine is required at the same time, then the injection should be carried out \non a different limb. In such cases, the side effects may be more intense). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of giving you the vaccine.

What Foclivia is and what it is used for \n \nFoclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nIt has to be used in adults (from 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years) to prevent flu caused \nby the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n \nFoclivia should not be given if you: \n- have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of \n\nFoclivia, \n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, \n- are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, \n- are allergic to any antibiotic, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and \n\npolysorbate 80. \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine: \n \n- if you feel feverish, \n- if you have any illness or infection, \n- if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for \n\ncancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency \nconditions). \n\n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have \nhad previous history of epilepsy. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse \nif you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Foclivia \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. Foclivia should not be given at the same time as \nother vaccines (if another vaccine is required at the same time, then the injection should be carried out \non a different limb. In such cases, the side effects may be more intense). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine.
