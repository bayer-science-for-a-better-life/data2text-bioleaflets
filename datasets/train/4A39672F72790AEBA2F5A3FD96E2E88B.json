NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTrobalt 50 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg of retigabine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPurple, round, film-coated tablets of 5.6 mm, marked with \u201cRTG 50\u201d on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrobalt is indicated as adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalization in patients aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, where other appropriate \ncombinations with other medicinal products have proved inadequate or have not been tolerated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTrobalt must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \n \nThe maximum total daily starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter, the total daily \ndose is increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response \nand tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and \n1,200 mg/day. \n \nThe maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of doses higher than \n1,200 mg/day have not been established. \n \nIf patients miss one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember. \n \nAfter taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours should be allowed before the next dose and then the \nnormal dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nWhen withdrawing Trobalt, the dose must be gradually reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nThere are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and \nabove. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nThe total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period the total daily dose should \nbe increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and \ntolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRetigabine and its metabolites are eliminated principally by renal excretion. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to \n80 ml/min; see section 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min; see section 5.2). The total \ndaily starting dose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily \ndose is increased by 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nFor patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis, the three daily doses should be \ntaken as usual on the dialysis day. In addition, a single supplemental dose is recommended \nimmediately after haemodialysis. If breakthrough seizures occur towards the end of dialysis then an \nadditional supplemental dose may be considered at the start of subsequent dialysis sessions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6; see \nsection 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22657; see section 5.2). The total daily starting \ndose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily dose is increased \nby 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retigabine in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established \n(see section 5.2). Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrobalt is for oral use. The tablets must be taken in three divided doses each day.  The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nTrobalt may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in long-\nterm clinical studies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes \nof the skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). Reversibility of retinal pigmentation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nafter retigabine discontinuation has been reported in some subjects. The long-term prognosis of these \nfindings is currently unknown, but some of the reports have been associated with visual impairment.   \n \nIn addition a distinct form of macular abnormality with features of vitelliform maculopathy (see \nsection 4.8) has also been identified, in most cases diagnosed with optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) imaging. The rate of progression of vitelliform maculopathy and its impact on retinal and \nmacular function and vision is unclear. Vision abnormalities (field constriction, loss of central \nsensitivity, and reduced visual acuity) have been reported.  \n \nAll patients should undergo comprehensive ophthalmological examinations at baseline and at least \nevery six months, which should include visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus \nphotography, and macular OCT imaging. If retinal pigment changes, vitelliform maculopathy or vision \nchanges are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of \nthe balance of benefits and risks. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. \n \nSkin disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of the skin, lips or nails have been reported in long-term clinical \nstudies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular \ntissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with \nTrobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. \n \nUrinary retention \n \nUrinary retention, dysuria and urinary hesitation were reported in controlled clinical studies with \nretigabine, generally within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). Trobalt must be used with \ncaution in patients at risk of urinary retention, and it is recommended that patients are advised about \nthe risk of these possible effects. \n \nQT interval \n \nA study of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects has demonstrated that retigabine titrated to 1,200 \nmg/day produced a QT-prolonging effect. A mean increase in Individual Corrected QT Interval (QTcI) \nof up to 6.7 ms (upper bound of 95% one-sided CI 12.6 ms) was observed within 3 hours of dosing. \nCaution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase \nQT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular \nhypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years \nof age and above. \n \nIn these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of \ntreatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should \nbe recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nConfusional state, psychotic disorders and hallucinations were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith retigabine (see section 4.8).  These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of \ntreatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nSuicide risk \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \nretigabine. \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nElderly patients may be at increased risk of central nervous system events, urinary retention and atrial \nfibrillation.  Trobalt must be used with caution in this population and a reduced initial and \nmaintenance dose is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWithdrawal seizures \n \nTrobalt must be withdrawn gradually to minimise the potential for rebound seizures.  It is \nrecommended that the Trobalt dose is reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns \nrequire an abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nRetigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine \nbilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOther antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn vitro data indicated a low potential for interaction with other antiepileptic medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  The drug interaction potential was, therefore, evaluated based on a pooled analysis \nacross clinical studies and whilst not considered as robust as stand-alone clinical interaction studies, \nthe results support the in vitro data. \n \nBased on these pooled data, retigabine did not cause clinically significant effects on the plasma trough \nconcentrations of the following antiepileptic medicinal products: \n- carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide. \n \nFurther, based on pooled data, there were no clinically significant effects of the following antiepileptic \nmedicinal products on retigabine pharmacokinetics: \n- lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate.   \n \nThis analysis also showed no clinically significant effect of the inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine \nand phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance. \n \nHowever, steady-state data from a limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:  \n-  phenytoin can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 35%  \n-  carbamazepine can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 33%  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nInteraction with digoxin \n \nData from an in vitro study showed that the N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) inhibited \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a concentration-dependent manner.  \n \nBased on a study conducted in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of retigabine (600-1,200 mg/day) \nresulted in a minor (8-18%) increase in digoxin AUC following a single oral dose of digoxin. The \nincrease did not appear to be dependent on retigabine dose and is not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no meaningful change in digoxin Cmax. No dose adjustment of digoxin is needed. \n \nInteraction with anaesthetics \nTrobalt may increase the duration of anaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental \nsodium; see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n \nCo-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual \nblurring in healthy volunteers. It is recommended that patients are advised about the possible effects \non vision if they take Trobalt with alcohol. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nAt retigabine doses of up to 750 mg/day, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the \npharmacokinetics of the estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestogen (norethindrone) components of the \noral contraceptive pill. In addition, there was no clinically significant effect of the low dose \ncombination oral contraceptive pill on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. The need for treatment \nwith antiepileptic medicinal products should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become \npregnant. In women being treated for epilepsy, sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic medicine \ntherapy should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child.  \n \nThe risk of congenital malformations is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in the offspring of mothers \ntreated with antiepileptic medicinal products compared with the expected incidence in the general \npopulation of approximately 3%. The most frequently reported defects are cleft lip, cardiovascular \nmalformations and neural tube defects. Therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicinal products is \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy and therefore \nmonotherapy should be used whenever possible.  \n \nRisk related to Trobalt \nThere are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies \nwere less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental \nstudy in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in \nauditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of \nthis finding is not known.  \n \nTrobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using \ncontraception. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of retagabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of retigabine on fertility in animal studies. However, the \nplasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe effect of retigabine on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each \ntitration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established \nhow Trobalt affects them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn pooled safety data from three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nadverse reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and were most commonly reported in \nthe first 8 weeks of treatment. There was an apparent dose-relationship for dizziness, somnolence, \nconfusional state, aphasia, coordination abnormal, tremor, balance disorder, memory impairment, gait \ndisturbance, blurred vision and constipation. \n \nAdverse reactions that were most frequently reported to lead to discontinuation were dizziness, \nsomnolence, fatigue and confusional state. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: \n \nVery common: \u22651/10 \nCommon:  \u22651/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  \u22651/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare: <1/10,000. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\n Weight increased \nIncreased appetite \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n Confusional state \nPsychotic disorders \nHallucinations \nDisorientation \nAnxiety \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n \n\nAmnesia \nAphasia \nCoordination abnormal \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nBalance disorder \nMemory impairment \nDysphasia \nDysarthria \nDisturbance in attention \nGait disturbance \nMyoclonus \n \n\nHypokinesia \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nPigment changes \n(discolouration) of \nocular tissues, \nincluding the \nretina, have been \nobserved after \nseveral years of \ntreatment.

The majority of events \noccurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was no apparent dose-relationship. \n \nIn retigabine-treated patients in the pooled dataset, confusional state was reported in 9% of patients, \nhallucinations in 2% of patients and psychotic disorders in 1% of patients (see section 4.4). The \nmajority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was an apparent \ndose-relationship for confusional state only. \nAdverse event data from clinical trial subjects showed a rate of event of discolouration of the nails, \nlips, skin and/or mucosa per patient year of exposure of 3.6%. The cumulative incidences of an event \nat 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of exposure are approximately 1%, 1.8%, 4.4%, 10.2% \nand 16.7% respectively. \n \nApproximately 30-40% of clinical trial subjects who were being treated with retigabine and underwent \na skin and/or ophthalmological examination had findings of discolouration of nails, lips, skin and/or \nmucosa or non-retinal ocular pigmentation, and approximately 15-30% of clinical trial subjects who \nwere being treated with retigabine and underwent an ophthalmological examination had retinal \npigmentation findings. In addition, cases of acquired vitelliform-type maculopathy have been \nidentified, both in clinical studies and as spontaneous reports. \n \nData from elderly patients indicates that they may be more likely to experience certain central nervous \nsystem events, including somnolence, amnesia, coordination abnormal, vertigo, tremor, balance \ndisorder, memory impairment and gait disturbance. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. \n \nRetigabine overdoses in excess of 2,500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to \nadverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, \naggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. \n \nIn a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) \noccurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias \nspontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as \nclinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as \nrecommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \nHaemodialysis has been shown to reduce the plasma concentrations of retigabine and NAMR by \napproximately 50%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPotassium channels are one of the voltage-gated ion channels found in neuronal cells and are \nimportant determinants of neuronal activity. In vitro studies indicate that retigabine acts primarily \nthrough opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises \nthe resting membrane potential and controls the sub-threshold electrical excitability in neurons, thus \npreventing the initiation of epileptiform action potential bursts. Mutations in the KCNQ channels \nunderlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The mechanism of \naction of retigabine on potassium channels has been well documented, however other mechanisms by \nwhich retigabine may assert an antiepileptic effect have yet to be fully elucidated. \n \nIn a range of seizure models, retigabine increased the threshold for seizure induction produced by \nmaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Retigabine \nalso displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models, for example, in the fully kindled state \nand in some cases during the kindling development. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing \nstatus epilepticus seizures in rodents with cobalt-induced epileptogenic lesions, and inhibiting tonic \nextensor seizures in genetically susceptible mice. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, \nhowever, is not known. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn rats, retigabine increased the sleep time induced by thiopental sodium from approximately 4 min to \n53 min, and the propofol-induced sleep time from approximately 8 min to 12 min. There was no effect \non sleep time induced by halothane or methohexital sodium. Retigabine may increase the duration of \nanaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nClinical efficacy of adjunctive retigabine therapy in partial onset seizures \n \nThree multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 1239 adult \npatients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset \nseizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that \nwere not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products, and more \nthan 75% of all patients were taking \u22652 concurrent antiepileptic medicinal products. Across all studies, \npatients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 22 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging \nfrom 8 to 12 per 28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or \n1,200 mg/day (see Table 1). During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience \u22654 partial \nonset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for \u226521 days. The duration of the \nmaintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were: \n- percentage change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to the \n\ndouble-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined) in all three studies \n- responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a \u226550% reduction in 28-day total \n\npartial seizure frequency) from baseline to the maintenance phase (Studies 301 and 302 only). \n \nRetigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical \nstudies (Table 1).  Retigabine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at 600 mg/day \n(one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies). \n \nThe studies were not designed to evaluate specific combinations of antiepileptic medicinal products. \nConsequently, the efficacy and safety of retigabine when taken concomitantly with antiepileptic \nmedicinal products that were less commonly used as background treatment in the clinical studies, \nincluding levetiracetam, has not been definitely shown. \n \nTable 1.

Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an \nintravenous dose is approximately 60%. \n \nAdministration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the overall extent of \nretigabine absorption, but food reduced the between-subject variability in Cmax (23%) compared to the \nfasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual \nclinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nDistribution \n \nRetigabine is approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to \n2 \u00b5g/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine is 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRetigabine is extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose is \nconverted to inactive N-glucuronides. Retigabine is also metabolised to an N-acetyl metabolite \n(NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. NAMR has antiepileptic activity, but is less potent \nthan retigabine in animal seizure models. \n \nThere is no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 \nenzymes.  Therefore, co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes is \nunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the \nmajor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, retigabine is unlikely to affect the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes through inhibition or \ninduction mechanisms. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nElimination \n \nElimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total \nof approximately 84% of the dose is recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), \nN-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active \nsubstance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine is excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of \napproximately 6 to 10 hours. The total clearance of retigabine from plasma following intravenous \ndosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg. \n \nLinearity \n \nRetigabine pharmacokinetics are essentially linear over the single-dose range of 25 to 600 mg in \nhealthy volunteers and up to 1,200 mg daily in patients with epilepsy, with no unexpected \naccumulation following repeated administration. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine AUC was increased by approximately 30% in volunteers with mild \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and by approximately 100% in volunteers \nwith moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min), relative to healthy \nvolunteers.  Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment but no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn a single-dose study in healthy volunteers and subjects with end stage renal disease, the retigabine \nAUC was increased by approximately 100% in the subjects with end stage renal disease relative to \nhealthy volunteers.  \n \nIn a second single-dose study in subjects with end stage renal disease receiving chronic haemodialysis \n(n= 8), initiation of dialysis at approximately 4 hours after a single dose of retigabine (100 mg) \nresulted in a median reduction in retigabine plasma concentrations of 52% from the start to end of \ndialysis. The percentage decrease in plasma concentration during dialysis ranged from 34% to 60% \nexcept for one subject who had a 17% reduction. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study, there were no clinically significant effects on retigabine AUC in volunteers \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6).  The retigabine AUC was increased by \napproximately 50% in volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) and by \napproximately 100% in volunteers with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9), relative to \nhealthy volunteers. Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, retigabine clearance increased with increasing body surface \narea. However, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful, and since retigabine is \ntitrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on \nthe basis of body weight. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine was eliminated more slowly by healthy elderly volunteers \n(66 to 82 years of age) relative to healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC \n(approximately 40 to 50%) and longer terminal half-life (30%) (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nGender \nThe results of a single-dose study showed that in young adult volunteers, retigabine Cmax was \napproximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age), \nretigabine Cmax was approximately 75% higher in females compared with males. When Cmax was \nnormalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and \n40% higher in elderly females compared with males. However, there was no apparent gender \ndifference in weight-normalized clearance, and since retigabine is titrated according to individual \npatient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of gender. \n \nRace \nA post-hoc analysis across multiple healthy volunteer studies demonstrated a 20% reduction in \nretigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. However, \nthis effect is not considered clinically significant, therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children below 12 years of age have not been investigated. \n \nAn open-label, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study in five subjects aged \nbetween 12 years to less than 18 years with partial onset seizures determined that the \npharmacokinetics of retigabine in adolescents were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of retigabine \nin adults.  However, efficacy and safety of retigabine have not been determined in adolescents. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMaximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects \nof retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure \nin these studies was generally less than that reached in humans at recommended clinical doses. \n \nDistension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis \nor other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder \ndistension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction \nwere seen clinically. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of genotoxicity or carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nRetigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. \n \nIn rats, retigabine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta resulting in tissue concentrations that \nwere similar in dams and foetuses. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of retigabine to pregnant animals \nduring the period of organogenesis. In a study of peri- and post-natal development in rats, retigabine \nwas associated with increased perinatal mortality following administration during pregnancy. In \naddition, there was a delay in auditory startle response development. These findings were apparent at \nexposure levels lower than those obtained with clinically recommended doses and were accompanied \nby maternal toxicities (including ataxia, hypokinesia, tremor and reduced body weight gain). The \nmaternal toxicities interfered with higher dosing of the dams and hence deduction of safety margins \nwith regard to human therapy.  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTrobalt 100 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of retigabine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nGreen, round, film-coated tablets of 7.1 mm, marked with \u201cRTG 100\u201d on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrobalt is indicated as adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalization in patients aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, where other appropriate \ncombinations with other medicinal products have proved inadequate or have not been tolerated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTrobalt must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \n \nThe maximum total daily starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter, the total daily \ndose is increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response \nand tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and \n1,200 mg/day. \n \nThe maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of doses higher than \n1,200 mg/day have not been established. \n \nIf patients miss one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember. \n \nAfter taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours should be allowed before the next dose and then the \nnormal dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nWhen withdrawing Trobalt, the dose must be gradually reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nThere are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and \nabove. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nThe total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period the total daily dose should \nbe increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and \ntolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRetigabine and its metabolites are eliminated principally by renal excretion. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to \n80 ml/min; see section 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min; see section 5.2). The total \ndaily starting dose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily \ndose is increased by 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nFor patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis, the three daily doses should be \ntaken as usual on the dialysis day. In addition, a single supplemental dose is recommended \nimmediately after haemodialysis. If breakthrough seizures occur towards the end of dialysis then an \nadditional supplemental dose may be considered at the start of subsequent dialysis sessions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6; see \nsection 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22657; see section 5.2). The total daily starting \ndose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily dose is increased \nby 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retigabine in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established \n(see section 5.2). Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrobalt is for oral use. The tablets must be taken in three divided doses each day.  The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nTrobalt may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in long-\nterm clinical studies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes \nof the skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). Reversibility of retinal pigmentation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nafter retigabine discontinuation has been reported in some subjects. The long-term prognosis of these \nfindings is currently unknown, but some of the reports have been associated with visual impairment.   \n \nIn addition a distinct form of macular abnormality with features of vitelliform maculopathy (see \nsection 4.8) has also been identified, in most cases diagnosed with optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) imaging. The rate of progression of vitelliform maculopathy and its impact on retinal and \nmacular function and vision is unclear. Vision abnormalities (field constriction, loss of central \nsensitivity, and reduced visual acuity) have been reported.  \n \nAll patients should undergo comprehensive ophthalmological examinations at baseline and at least \nevery six months, which should include visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus \nphotography, and macular OCT imaging. If retinal pigment changes, vitelliform maculopathy or vision \nchanges are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of \nthe balance of benefits and risks. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. \n \nSkin disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of the skin, lips or nails have been reported in long-term clinical \nstudies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular \ntissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with \nTrobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. \n \nUrinary retention \n \nUrinary retention, dysuria and urinary hesitation were reported in controlled clinical studies with \nretigabine, generally within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). Trobalt must be used with \ncaution in patients at risk of urinary retention, and it is recommended that patients are advised about \nthe risk of these possible effects. \n \nQT interval \n \nA study of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects has demonstrated that retigabine titrated to 1,200 \nmg/day produced a QT-prolonging effect. A mean increase in Individual Corrected QT Interval (QTcI) \nof up to 6.7 ms (upper bound of 95% one-sided CI 12.6 ms) was observed within 3 hours of dosing. \nCaution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase \nQT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular \nhypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years \nof age and above. \n \nIn these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of \ntreatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should \nbe recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nConfusional state, psychotic disorders and hallucinations were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith retigabine (see section 4.8).  These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of \ntreatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nSuicide risk \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \nretigabine. \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nElderly patients may be at increased risk of central nervous system events, urinary retention and atrial \nfibrillation.  Trobalt must be used with caution in this population and a reduced initial and \nmaintenance dose is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWithdrawal seizures \n \nTrobalt must be withdrawn gradually to minimise the potential for rebound seizures.  It is \nrecommended that the Trobalt dose is reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns \nrequire an abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nRetigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine \nbilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOther antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn vitro data indicated a low potential for interaction with other antiepileptic medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  The drug interaction potential was, therefore, evaluated based on a pooled analysis \nacross clinical studies and whilst not considered as robust as stand-alone clinical interaction studies, \nthe results support the in vitro data. \n \nBased on these pooled data, retigabine did not cause clinically significant effects on the plasma trough \nconcentrations of the following antiepileptic medicinal products: \n- carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide. \n \nFurther, based on pooled data, there were no clinically significant effects of the following antiepileptic \nmedicinal products on retigabine pharmacokinetics: \n- lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate.   \nThis analysis also showed no clinically significant effect of the inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine \nand phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance. \n \nHowever, steady-state data from a limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:  \n-  phenytoin can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 35% \n-  carbamazepine can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 33% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \nInteraction with digoxin \n \nData from an in vitro study showed that the N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) inhibited \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a concentration-dependent manner.  \n \nBased on a study conducted in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of retigabine (600-1,200 mg/day) \nresulted in a minor (8-18%) increase in digoxin AUC following a single oral dose of digoxin. The \nincrease did not appear to be dependent on retigabine dose and is not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no meaningful change in digoxin Cmax. No dose adjustment of digoxin is needed. \n \nInteraction with anaesthetics \nTrobalt may increase the duration of anaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental \nsodium; see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n \nCo-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual \nblurring in healthy volunteers. It is recommended that patients are advised about the possible effects \non vision if they take Trobalt with alcohol. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nAt retigabine doses of up to 750 mg/day, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the \npharmacokinetics of the estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestogen (norethindrone) components of the \noral contraceptive pill. In addition, there was no clinically significant effect of the low dose \ncombination oral contraceptive pill on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. The need for treatment \nwith antiepileptic medicinal products should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become \npregnant. In women being treated for epilepsy, sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic medicine \ntherapy should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child.  \n \nThe risk of congenital malformations is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in the offspring of mothers \ntreated with antiepileptic medicinal products compared with the expected incidence in the general \npopulation of approximately 3%. The most frequently reported defects are cleft lip, cardiovascular \nmalformations and neural tube defects. Therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicinal products is \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy and therefore \nmonotherapy should be used whenever possible. \n \nRisk related to Trobalt \nThere are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies \nwere less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental \nstudy in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in \nauditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of \nthis finding is not known.  \n \nTrobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using \ncontraception. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of retagabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of retigabine on fertility in animal studies. However, the \nplasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe effect of retigabine on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each \ntitration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established \nhow Trobalt affects them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn pooled safety data from three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nadverse reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and were most commonly reported in \nthe first 8 weeks of treatment. There was an apparent dose-relationship for dizziness, somnolence, \nconfusional state, aphasia, coordination abnormal, tremor, balance disorder, memory impairment, gait \ndisturbance, blurred vision and constipation. \n \nAdverse reactions that were most frequently reported to lead to discontinuation were dizziness, \nsomnolence, fatigue and confusional state. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: \n \nVery common: \u22651/10 \nCommon:  \u22651/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  \u22651/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare: <1/10,000. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\n Weight increased \nIncreased appetite \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n Confusional state \nPsychotic disorders \nHallucinations \nDisorientation \nAnxiety \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n \n\nAmnesia \nAphasia \nCoordination abnormal \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nBalance disorder \nMemory impairment \nDysphasia \nDysarthria \nDisturbance in attention \nGait disturbance \nMyoclonus \n \n\nHypokinesia \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nPigment changes \n(discolouration) \nof ocular tissues, \nincluding the \nretina, have been \nobserved after \nseveral years of \ntreatment.

The majority of events \noccurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was no apparent dose-relationship. \n \nIn retigabine-treated patients in the pooled dataset, confusional state was reported in 9% of patients, \nhallucinations in 2% of patients and psychotic disorders in 1% of patients (see section 4.4). The \nmajority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was an apparent \ndose-relationship for confusional state only. \n \nAdverse event data from clinical trial subjects showed a rate of event of discolouration of the nails, \nlips, skin and/or mucosa per patient year of exposure of 3.6%. The cumulative incidences of an event \nat 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of exposure are approximately 1%, 1.8%, 4.4%, 10.2% \nand 16.7% respectively. \n \nApproximately 30-40% of clinical trial subjects who were being treated with retigabine and underwent \na skin and/or ophthalmological examination had findings of discolouration of nails, lips, skin and/or \nmucosa or non-retinal ocular pigmentation, and approximately 15-30% of clinical trial subjects who \nwere being treated with retigabine and underwent an ophthalmological examination had retinal \npigmentation findings. In addition, cases of acquired vitelliform-type maculopathy have been \nidentified, both in clinical studies and as spontaneous reports. \n \nData from elderly patients indicates that they may be more likely to experience certain central nervous \nsystem events, including somnolence, amnesia, coordination abnormal, vertigo, tremor, balance \ndisorder, memory impairment and gait disturbance. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \nThere is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. \n \nRetigabine overdoses in excess of 2,500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to \nadverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, \naggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. \n \nIn a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) \noccurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias \nspontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as \nclinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as \nrecommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \nHaemodialysis has been shown to reduce the plasma concentrations of retigabine and NAMR by \napproximately 50%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPotassium channels are one of the voltage-gated ion channels found in neuronal cells and are \nimportant determinants of neuronal activity. In vitro studies indicate that retigabine acts primarily \nthrough opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises \nthe resting membrane potential and controls the sub-threshold electrical excitability in neurons, thus \npreventing the initiation of epileptiform action potential bursts. Mutations in the KCNQ channels \nunderlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The mechanism of \naction of retigabine on potassium channels has been well documented, however other mechanisms by \nwhich retigabine may assert an antiepileptic effect have yet to be fully elucidated. \n \nIn a range of seizure models, retigabine increased the threshold for seizure induction produced by \nmaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Retigabine \nalso displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models, for example, in the fully kindled state \nand in some cases during the kindling development. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing \nstatus epilepticus seizures in rodents with cobalt-induced epileptogenic lesions, and inhibiting tonic \nextensor seizures in genetically susceptible mice. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, \nhowever, is not known. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn rats, retigabine increased the sleep time induced by thiopental sodium from approximately 4 min to \n53 min, and the propofol-induced sleep time from approximately 8 min to 12 min. There was no effect \non sleep time induced by halothane or methohexital sodium. Retigabine may increase the duration of \nanaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nClinical efficacy of adjunctive retigabine therapy in partial onset seizures \n \nThree multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 1239 adult \npatients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset \nseizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that \nwere not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products, and more \nthan 75% of all patients were taking \u22652 concurrent antiepileptic medicinal products. Across all studies, \npatients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 22 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging \nfrom 8 to 12 per 28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or \n1,200 mg/day (see Table 1). During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience \u22654 partial \nonset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for \u226521 days. The duration of the \nmaintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were: \n- percentage change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to the \n\ndouble-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined) in all three studies \n- responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a \u226550% reduction in 28-day total \n\npartial seizure frequency) from baseline to the maintenance phase (Studies 301 and 302 only). \n \nRetigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical \nstudies (Table 1).  Retigabine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at 600 mg/day \n(one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies). \n \nThe studies were not designed to evaluate specific combinations of antiepileptic medicinal products. \nConsequently, the efficacy and safety of retigabine when taken concomitantly with antiepileptic \nmedicinal products that were less commonly used as background treatment in the clinical studies, \nincluding levetiracetam, has not been definitely shown. \n \nTable 1.

Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an \nintravenous dose is approximately 60%. \n \nAdministration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the overall extent of \nretigabine absorption, but food reduced the between-subject variability in Cmax (23%) compared to the \nfasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual \nclinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nDistribution \n \nRetigabine is approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to \n2 \u00b5g/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine is 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRetigabine is extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose is \nconverted to inactive N-glucuronides. Retigabine is also metabolised to an N-acetyl metabolite \n(NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. NAMR has antiepileptic activity, but is less potent \nthan retigabine in animal seizure models. \n \nThere is no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 \nenzymes.  Therefore, co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes is \nunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. \n \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the \nmajor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, retigabine is unlikely to affect the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes through inhibition or \ninduction mechanisms. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nElimination \n \nElimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total \nof approximately 84% of the dose is recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), \nN-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active \nsubstance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine is excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of \napproximately 6 to 10 hours. The total clearance of retigabine from plasma following intravenous \ndosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg. \n \nLinearity \n \nRetigabine pharmacokinetics are essentially linear over the single-dose range of 25 to 600 mg in \nhealthy volunteers and up to 1,200 mg daily in patients with epilepsy, with no unexpected \naccumulation following repeated administration. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine AUC was increased by approximately 30% in volunteers with mild \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and by approximately 100% in volunteers \nwith moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min), relative to healthy \nvolunteers.  Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment but no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn a single-dose study in healthy volunteers and subjects with end stage renal disease, the retigabine \nAUC was increased by approximately 100% in the subjects with end stage renal disease relative to \nhealthy volunteers.  \n \nIn a second single-dose study in subjects with end stage renal disease receiving chronic haemodialysis \n(n= 8), initiation of dialysis at approximately 4 hours after a single dose of retigabine (100 mg) \nresulted in a median reduction in retigabine plasma concentrations of 52% from the start to end of \ndialysis. The percentage decrease in plasma concentration during dialysis ranged from 34% to 60% \nexcept for one subject who had a 17% reduction. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study, there were no clinically significant effects on retigabine AUC in volunteers \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6).  The retigabine AUC was increased by \napproximately 50% in volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) and by \napproximately 100% in volunteers with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9), relative to \nhealthy volunteers. Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, retigabine clearance increased with increasing body surface \narea. However, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful, and since retigabine is \ntitrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on \nthe basis of body weight. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine was eliminated more slowly by healthy elderly volunteers \n(66 to 82 years of age) relative to healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC \n(approximately 40 to 50%) and longer terminal half-life (30%) (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nGender \nThe results of a single-dose study showed that in young adult volunteers, retigabine Cmax was \napproximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age), \nretigabine Cmax was approximately 75% higher in females compared with males. When Cmax was \nnormalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and \n40% higher in elderly females compared with males. However, there was no apparent gender \ndifference in weight-normalized clearance, and since retigabine is titrated according to individual \npatient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of gender. \n \nRace \nA post-hoc analysis across multiple healthy volunteer studies demonstrated a 20% reduction in \nretigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. However, \nthis effect is not considered clinically significant, therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children below 12 years of age have not been investigated. \n \nAn open-label, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study in five subjects aged \nbetween 12 years to less than 18 years with partial onset seizures determined that the \npharmacokinetics of retigabine in adolescents were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of retigabine \nin adults.  However, efficacy and safety of retigabine have not been determined in adolescents. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMaximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects \nof retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure \nin these studies was generally less than that reached in humans at recommended clinical doses. \n \nDistension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis \nor other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder \ndistension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction \nwere seen clinically. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of genotoxicity or carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nRetigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. \n \nIn rats, retigabine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta resulting in tissue concentrations that \nwere similar in dams and foetuses. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of retigabine to pregnant animals \nduring the period of organogenesis. In a study of peri- and post-natal development in rats, retigabine \nwas associated with increased perinatal mortality following administration during pregnancy. In \naddition, there was a delay in auditory startle response development. These findings were apparent at \nexposure levels lower than those obtained with clinically recommended doses and were accompanied \nby maternal toxicities (including ataxia, hypokinesia, tremor and reduced body weight gain). The \nmaternal toxicities interfered with higher dosing of the dams and hence deduction of safety margins \nwith regard to human therapy.  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nYellow, oblong, film-coated tablets of 7.1 mm x 14 mm, marked with \u201cRTG-200\u201d on one side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrobalt is indicated as adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalization in patients aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, where other appropriate \ncombinations with other medicinal products have proved inadequate or have not been tolerated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTrobalt must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \n \nThe maximum total daily starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter, the total daily \ndose is increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response \nand tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and \n1,200 mg/day. \n \nThe maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of doses higher than \n1,200 mg/day have not been established. \n \nIf patients miss one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember. \n \nAfter taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours should be allowed before the next dose and then the \nnormal dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nWhen withdrawing Trobalt, the dose must be gradually reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nThere are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and \nabove. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nThe total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period the total daily dose should \nbe increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and \ntolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRetigabine and its metabolites are eliminated principally by renal excretion. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to \n80 ml/min; see section 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min; see section 5.2). The total \ndaily starting dose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily \ndose is increased by 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nFor patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis, the three daily doses should be \ntaken as usual on the dialysis day. In addition, a single supplemental dose is recommended \nimmediately after haemodialysis. If breakthrough seizures occur towards the end of dialysis then an \nadditional supplemental dose may be considered at the start of subsequent dialysis sessions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6; see \nsection 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22657; see section 5.2). The total daily starting \ndose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily dose is increased \nby 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retigabine in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established \n(see section 5.2). Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrobalt is for oral use. The tablets must be taken in three divided doses each day.  The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nTrobalt may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in long-\nterm clinical studies withretigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of \nthe skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). Reversibility of retinal pigmentation after \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nretigabine discontinuation has been reported in some subjects. The long-term prognosis of these \nfindings is currently unknown, but some of the reports have been associated with visual impairment. \n \nIn addition a distinct form of macular abnormality with features of vitelliform maculopathy (see \nsection 4.8) has also been identified, in most cases diagnosed with optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) imaging. The rate of progression of vitelliform maculopathy and its impact on retinal and \nmacular function and vision is unclear. Vision abnormalities (field constriction, loss of central \nsensitivity, and reduced visual acuity) have been reported.  \n \nAll patients should undergo comprehensive ophthalmological examinations at baseline and at least \nevery six months, which should include visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus \nphotography, and macular OCT imaging. If retinal pigment changes, vitelliform maculopathy or vision \nchanges are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of \nthe balance of benefits and risks. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. \n \nSkin disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of the skin, lips or nails have been reported in long-term clinical \nstudies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular \ntissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with \nTrobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. \n \nUrinary retention \n \nUrinary retention, dysuria and urinary hesitation were reported in controlled clinical studies with \nretigabine, generally within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). Trobalt must be used with \ncaution in patients at risk of urinary retention, and it is recommended that patients are advised about \nthe risk of these possible effects. \n \nQT interval \n \nA study of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects has demonstrated that retigabine titrated to 1,200 \nmg/day produced a QT-prolonging effect. A mean increase in Individual Corrected QT Interval (QTcI) \nof up to 6.7 ms (upper bound of 95% one-sided CI 12.6 ms) was observed within 3 hours of dosing. \nCaution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase \nQT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular \nhypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years \nof age and above. \n \nIn these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of \ntreatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should \nbe recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nConfusional state, psychotic disorders and hallucinations were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith retigabine (see section 4.8).  These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of \ntreatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nSuicide risk \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \nretigabine. \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nElderly patients may be at increased risk of central nervous system events, urinary retention and atrial \nfibrillation.  Trobalt must be used with caution in this population and a reduced initial and \nmaintenance dose is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWithdrawal seizures \n \nTrobalt must be withdrawn gradually to minimise the potential for rebound seizures.  It is \nrecommended that the Trobalt dose is reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns \nrequire an abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nRetigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine \nbilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOther antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn vitro data indicated a low potential for interaction with other antiepileptic medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  The drug interaction potential was, therefore, evaluated based on a pooled analysis \nacross clinical studies and whilst not considered as robust as stand-alone clinical interaction studies, \nthe results support the in vitro data. \n \nBased on these pooled data, retigabine did not cause clinically significant effects on the plasma trough \nconcentrations of the following antiepileptic medicinal products: \n- carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide. \n \nFurther, based on pooled data, there were no clinically significant effects of the following antiepileptic \nmedicinal products on retigabine pharmacokinetics: \n- lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate.   \n \nThis analysis also showed no clinically significant effect of the inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine \nand phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance. \n \nHowever, steady-state data from a limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:  \n-  phenytoin can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 35% \n-  carbamazepine can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 33% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \nInteraction with digoxin \n \nData from an in vitro study showed that the N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) inhibited \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a concentration-dependent manner.  \n \nBased on a study conducted in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of retigabine (600-1,200 mg/day) \nresulted in a minor (8-18%) increase in digoxin AUC following a single oral dose of digoxin. The \nincrease did not appear to be dependent on retigabine dose and is not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no meaningful change in digoxin Cmax. No dose adjustment of digoxin is needed. \n \nInteraction with anaesthetics \n \nTrobalt may increase the duration of anaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental \nsodium; see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n \nCo-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual \nblurring in healthy volunteers. It is recommended that patients are advised about the possible effects \non vision if they take Trobalt with alcohol. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nAt retigabine doses of up to 750 mg/day, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the \npharmacokinetics of the estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestogen (norethindrone) components of the \noral contraceptive pill. In addition, there was no clinically significant effect of the low dose \ncombination oral contraceptive pill on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. The need for treatment \nwith antiepileptic medicinal products should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become \npregnant. In women being treated for epilepsy, sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic medicine \ntherapy should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child.  \n \nThe risk of congenital malformations is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in the offspring of mothers \ntreated with antiepileptic medicinal products compared with the expected incidence in the general \npopulation of approximately 3%. The most frequently reported defects are cleft lip, cardiovascular \nmalformations and neural tube defects. Therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicinal products is \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy and therefore \nmonotherapy should be used whenever possible. \n \nRisk related to Trobalt \nThere are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies \nwere less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental \nstudy in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in \nauditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of \nthis finding is not known.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nTrobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of retagabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of retigabine on fertility in animal studies. However, the \nplasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe effect of retigabine on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each \ntitration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established \nhow Trobalt affects them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn pooled safety data from three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nadverse reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and were most commonly reported in \nthe first 8 weeks of treatment. There was an apparent dose-relationship for dizziness, somnolence, \nconfusional state, aphasia, coordination abnormal, tremor, balance disorder, memory impairment, gait \ndisturbance, blurred vision and constipation. \n \nAdverse reactions that were most frequently reported to lead to discontinuation were dizziness, \nsomnolence, fatigue and confusional state. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: \n \nVery common: \u22651/10 \nCommon:  \u22651/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  \u22651/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare: <1/10,000. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\n Weight increased \nIncreased appetite \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n Confusional state \nPsychotic disorders \nHallucinations \nDisorientation \nAnxiety \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n \n\nAmnesia \nAphasia \nCoordination abnormal \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nBalance disorder \nMemory impairment \nDysphasia \nDysarthria \nDisturbance in attention \nGait disturbance \nMyoclonus \n \n\nHypokinesia \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nPigment changes \n(discolouration) \nof ocular tissues, \nincluding the \nretina, have been \nobserved after \nseveral years of \ntreatment.

The majority of events \noccurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was no apparent dose-relationship. \n \nIn retigabine-treated patients in the pooled dataset, confusional state was reported in 9% of patients, \nhallucinations in 2% of patients and psychotic disorders in 1% of patients (see section 4.4). The \nmajority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was an apparent \ndose-relationship for confusional state only. \n \nAdverse event data from clinical trial subjects showed a rate of event of discolouration of the nails, \nlips, skin and/or mucosa per patient year of exposure of 3.6%. The cumulative incidences of an event \nat 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of exposure are approximately 1%, 1.8%, 4.4%, 10.2% \nand 16.7% respectively. \n \nApproximately 30-40% of clinical trial subjects who were being treated with retigabine and underwent \na skin and/or ophthalmological examination had findings of discolouration of nails, lips, skin and/or \nmucosa or non-retinal ocular pigmentation, and approximately 15-30% of clinical trial subjects who \nwere being treated with retigabine and underwent an ophthalmological examination had retinal \npigmentation findings. In addition, cases of acquired vitelliform-type maculopathy have been \nidentified, both in clinical studies and as spontaneous reports. \n \nData from elderly patients indicates that they may be more likely to experience certain central nervous \nsystem events, including somnolence, amnesia, coordination abnormal, vertigo, tremor, balance \ndisorder, memory impairment and gait disturbance. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. \n \nRetigabine overdoses in excess of 2,500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to \nadverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, \naggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. \n \nIn a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) \noccurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias \nspontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as \nclinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as \nrecommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \nHaemodialysis has been shown to reduce the plasma concentrations of retigabine and NAMR by \napproximately 50%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPotassium channels are one of the voltage-gated ion channels found in neuronal cells and are \nimportant determinants of neuronal activity. In vitro studies indicate that retigabine acts primarily \nthrough opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises \nthe resting membrane potential and controls the sub-threshold electrical excitability in neurons, thus \npreventing the initiation of epileptiform action potential bursts. Mutations in the KCNQ channels \nunderlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The mechanism of \naction of retigabine on potassium channels has been well documented, however other mechanisms by \nwhich retigabine may assert an antiepileptic effect have yet to be fully elucidated. \n \nIn a range of seizure models, retigabine increased the threshold for seizure induction produced by \nmaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Retigabine \nalso displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models, for example, in the fully kindled state \nand in some cases during the kindling development. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing \nstatus epilepticus seizures in rodents with cobalt-induced epileptogenic lesions, and inhibiting tonic \nextensor seizures in genetically susceptible mice. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, \nhowever, is not known. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn rats, retigabine increased the sleep time induced by thiopental sodium from approximately 4 min to \n53 min, and the propofol-induced sleep time from approximately 8 min to 12 min. There was no effect \non sleep time induced by halothane or methohexital sodium. Retigabine may increase the duration of \nanaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nClinical efficacy of adjunctive retigabine therapy in partial onset seizures \n \nThree multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 1239 adult \npatients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset \nseizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that \nwere not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products, and more \nthan 75% of all patients were taking \u22652 concurrent antiepileptic medicinal products. Across all studies, \npatients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 22 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging \nfrom 8 to 12 per 28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or \n1,200 mg/day (see Table 1). During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience \u22654 partial \nonset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for \u226521 days. The duration of the \nmaintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were: \n- percentage change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to the \n\ndouble-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined) in all three studies \n- responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a \u226550% reduction in 28-day total \n\npartial seizure frequency) from baseline to the maintenance phase (Studies 301 and 302 only). \n \nRetigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical \nstudies (Table 1).  Retigabine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at 600 mg/day \n(one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies). \n \nThe studies were not designed to evaluate specific combinations of antiepileptic medicinal products. \nConsequently, the efficacy and safety of retigabine when taken concomitantly with antiepileptic \nmedicinal products that were less commonly used as background treatment in the clinical studies, \nincluding levetiracetam, has not been definitely shown. \n \nTable 1.

Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an \nintravenous dose is approximately 60%. \n \nAdministration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the overall extent of \nretigabine absorption, but food reduced the between-subject variability in Cmax (23%) compared to the \nfasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual \nclinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nDistribution \n \nRetigabine is approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to \n2 \u00b5g/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine is 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRetigabine is extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose is \nconverted to inactive N-glucuronides. Retigabine is also metabolised to an N-acetyl metabolite \n(NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. NAMR has antiepileptic activity, but is less potent \nthan retigabine in animal seizure models. \n \nThere is no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 \nenzymes.  Therefore, co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes is \nunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the \nmajor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, retigabine is unlikely to affect the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes through inhibition or \ninduction mechanisms. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nElimination \n \nElimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total \nof approximately 84% of the dose is recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), \nN-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active \nsubstance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine is excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of \napproximately 6 to 10 hours. The total clearance of retigabine from plasma following intravenous \ndosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg. \n \nLinearity \n \nRetigabine pharmacokinetics are essentially linear over the single-dose range of 25 to 600 mg in \nhealthy volunteers and up to 1,200 mg daily in patients with epilepsy, with no unexpected \naccumulation following repeated administration. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine AUC was increased by approximately 30% in volunteers with mild \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and by approximately 100% in volunteers \nwith moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min), relative to healthy \nvolunteers.  Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment but no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn a single-dose study in healthy volunteers and subjects with end stage renal disease, the retigabine \nAUC was increased by approximately 100% in the subjects with end stage renal disease relative to \nhealthy volunteers.  \n \nIn a second single-dose study in subjects with end stage renal disease receiving chronic haemodialysis \n(n= 8), initiation of dialysis at approximately 4 hours after a single dose of retigabine (100 mg) \nresulted in a median reduction in retigabine plasma concentrations of 52% from the start to end of \ndialysis. The percentage decrease in plasma concentration during dialysis ranged from 34% to 60% \nexcept for one subject who had a 17% reduction. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study, there were no clinically significant effects on retigabine AUC in volunteers \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6).  The retigabine AUC was increased by \napproximately 50% in volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) and by \napproximately 100% in volunteers with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9), relative to \nhealthy volunteers. Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, retigabine clearance increased with increasing body surface \narea. However, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful, and since retigabine is \ntitrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on \nthe basis of body weight. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine was eliminated more slowly by healthy elderly volunteers \n(66 to 82 years of age) relative to healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC \n(approximately 40 to 50%) and longer terminal half-life (30%) (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nGender \nThe results of a single-dose study showed that in young adult volunteers, retigabine Cmax was \napproximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age), \nretigabine Cmax was approximately 75% higher in females compared with males. When Cmax was \nnormalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and \n40% higher in elderly females compared with males. However, there was no apparent gender \ndifference in weight-normalized clearance, and since retigabine is titrated according to individual \npatient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of gender. \n \nRace \nA post-hoc analysis across multiple healthy volunteer studies demonstrated a 20% reduction in \nretigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. However, \nthis effect is not considered clinically significant, therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children below 12 years of age have not been investigated. \n \nAn open-label, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study in five subjects aged \nbetween 12 years to less than 18 years with partial onset seizures determined that the \npharmacokinetics of retigabine in adolescents were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of retigabine \nin adults.  However, efficacy and safety of retigabine have not been determined in adolescents. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMaximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects \nof retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure \nin these studies was generally less than that reached in humans at recommended clinical doses. \n \nDistension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis \nor other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder \ndistension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction \nwere seen clinically. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of genotoxicity or carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nRetigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. \n \nIn rats, retigabine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta resulting in tissue concentrations that \nwere similar in dams and foetuses. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of retigabine to pregnant animals \nduring the period of organogenesis. In a study of peri- and post-natal development in rats, retigabine \nwas associated with increased perinatal mortality following administration during pregnancy. In \naddition, there was a delay in auditory startle response development. These findings were apparent at \nexposure levels lower than those obtained with clinically recommended doses and were accompanied \nby maternal toxicities (including ataxia, hypokinesia, tremor and reduced body weight gain). The \nmaternal toxicities interfered with higher dosing of the dams and hence deduction of safety margins \nwith regard to human therapy.  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTrobalt 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of retigabine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nGreen, oblong, film-coated tablets of 7.1 mm x 16 mm, marked with \u201cRTG-300\u201d on one side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrobalt is indicated as adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalization in patients aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, where other appropriate \ncombinations with other medicinal products have proved inadequate or have not been tolerated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTrobalt must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \n \nThe maximum total daily starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter, the total daily \ndose is increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response \nand tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and \n1,200 mg/day. \n \nThe maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of doses higher than \n1,200 mg/day have not been established. \n \nIf patients miss one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember. \n \nAfter taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours should be allowed before the next dose and then the \nnormal dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nWhen withdrawing Trobalt, the dose must be gradually reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nThere are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and \nabove. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nThe total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period the total daily dose should \nbe increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and \ntolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRetigabine and its metabolites are eliminated principally by renal excretion. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to \n80 ml/min; see section 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min; see section 5.2). The total \ndaily starting dose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily \ndose is increased by 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nFor patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis, the three daily doses should be \ntaken as usual on the dialysis day. In addition, a single supplemental dose is recommended \nimmediately after haemodialysis. If breakthrough seizures occur towards the end of dialysis then an \nadditional supplemental dose may be considered at the start of subsequent dialysis sessions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6; see \nsection 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22657; see section 5.2). The total daily starting \ndose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily dose is increased \nby 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retigabine in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established \n(see section 5.2). Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrobalt is for oral use. The tablets must be taken in three divided doses each day.  The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nTrobalt may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in long-\nterm clinical studies withretigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of \nthe skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). Reversibility of retinal pigmentation after \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nretigabine discontinuation has been reported in some subjects. The long-term prognosis of these \nfindings is currently unknown, but some of the reports have been associated with visual impairment. \n \nIn addition a distinct form of macular abnormality with features of vitelliform maculopathy (see \nsection 4.8) has also been identified, in most cases diagnosed with optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) imaging. The rate of progression of vitelliform maculopathy and its impact on retinal and \nmacular function and vision is unclear. Vision abnormalities (field constriction, loss of central \nsensitivity, and reduced visual acuity) have been reported.  \n \nAll patients should undergo comprehensive ophthalmological examinations at baseline and at least \nevery six months, which should include visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus \nphotography, and macular OCT imaging. If retinal pigment changes, vitelliform maculopathy or vision \nchanges are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of \nthe balance of benefits and risks. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. \n \nSkin disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of the skin, lips or nails have been reported in long-term clinical \nstudies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular \ntissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with \nTrobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. \n \nUrinary retention \n \nUrinary retention, dysuria and urinary hesitation were reported in controlled clinical studies with \nretigabine, generally within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). Trobalt must be used with \ncaution in patients at risk of urinary retention, and it is recommended that patients are advised about \nthe risk of these possible effects. \n \nQT interval \n \nA study of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects has demonstrated that retigabine titrated to 1,200 \nmg/day produced a QT-prolonging effect. A mean increase in Individual Corrected QT Interval (QTcI) \nof up to 6.7 ms (upper bound of 95% one-sided CI 12.6 ms) was observed within 3 hours of dosing. \nCaution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase \nQT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular \nhypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years \nof age and above. \n \nIn these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of \ntreatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should \nbe recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nConfusional state, psychotic disorders and hallucinations were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith retigabine (see section 4.8).  These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of \ntreatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nSuicide risk \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \nretigabine. \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nElderly patients may be at increased risk of central nervous system events, urinary retention and atrial \nfibrillation.  Trobalt must be used with caution in this population and a reduced initial and \nmaintenance dose is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWithdrawal seizures \n \nTrobalt must be withdrawn gradually to minimise the potential for rebound seizures.  It is \nrecommended that the Trobalt dose is reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns \nrequire an abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nRetigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine \nbilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOther antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn vitro data indicated a low potential for interaction with other antiepileptic medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  The drug interaction potential was, therefore, evaluated based on a pooled analysis \nacross clinical studies and whilst not considered as robust as stand-alone clinical interaction studies, \nthe results support the in vitro data. \n \nBased on these pooled data, retigabine did not cause clinically significant effects on the plasma trough \nconcentrations of the following antiepileptic medicinal products: \n- carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide. \n \nFurther, based on pooled data, there were no clinically significant effects of the following antiepileptic \nmedicinal products on retigabine pharmacokinetics: \n- lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate.   \n \nThis analysis also showed no clinically significant effect of the inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine \nand phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance. \n \nHowever, steady-state data from a limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:  \n-  phenytoin can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 35% \n-  carbamazepine can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 33% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \nInteraction with digoxin \n \nData from an in vitro study showed that the N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) inhibited \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a concentration-dependent manner.  \n \nBased on a study conducted in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of retigabine (600-1,200 mg/day) \nresulted in a minor (8-18%) increase in digoxin AUC following a single oral dose of digoxin. The \nincrease did not appear to be dependent on retigabine dose and is not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no meaningful change in digoxin Cmax. No dose adjustment of digoxin is needed. \n \nInteraction with anaesthetics \nTrobalt may increase the duration of anaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental \nsodium; see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n \nCo-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual \nblurring in healthy volunteers. It is recommended that patients are advised about the possible effects \non vision if they take Trobalt with alcohol. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nAt retigabine doses of up to 750 mg/day, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the \npharmacokinetics of the estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestogen (norethindrone) components of the \noral contraceptive pill. In addition, there was no clinically significant effect of the low dose \ncombination oral contraceptive pill on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. The need for treatment \nwith antiepileptic medicinal products should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become \npregnant. In women being treated for epilepsy, sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic medicine \ntherapy should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child.  \n \nThe risk of congenital malformations is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in the offspring of mothers \ntreated with antiepileptic medicinal products compared with the expected incidence in the general \npopulation of approximately 3%. The most frequently reported defects are cleft lip, cardiovascular \nmalformations and neural tube defects. Therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicinal products is \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy and therefore \nmonotherapy should be used whenever possible. \n \nRisk related to Trobalt \nThere are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies \nwere less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental \nstudy in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in \nauditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of \nthis finding is not known.  \n \nTrobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using \ncontraception. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of retagabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of retigabine on fertility in animal studies. However, the \nplasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe effect of retigabine on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each \ntitration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established \nhow Trobalt affects them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn pooled safety data from three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nadverse reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and were most commonly reported in \nthe first 8 weeks of treatment. There was an apparent dose-relationship for dizziness, somnolence, \nconfusional state, aphasia, coordination abnormal, tremor, balance disorder, memory impairment, gait \ndisturbance, blurred vision and constipation. \n \nAdverse reactions that were most frequently reported to lead to discontinuation were dizziness, \nsomnolence, fatigue and confusional state. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: \n \nVery common: \u22651/10 \nCommon:  \u22651/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  \u22651/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare: <1/10,000. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\n Weight increased \nIncreased appetite \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n Confusional state \nPsychotic disorders \nHallucinations \nDisorientation \nAnxiety \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n \n\nAmnesia \nAphasia \nCoordination abnormal \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nBalance disorder \nMemory impairment \nDysphasia \nDysarthria \nDisturbance in attention \nGait disturbance \nMyoclonus \n \n\nHypokinesia \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nPigment changes \n(discolouration) \nof ocular tissues, \nincluding the \nretina, have been \nobserved after \nseveral years of \ntreatment.

The majority of events \noccurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was no apparent dose-relationship. \n \nIn retigabine-treated patients in the pooled dataset, confusional state was reported in 9% of patients, \nhallucinations in 2% of patients and psychotic disorders in 1% of patients (see section 4.4). The \nmajority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was an apparent \ndose-relationship for confusional state only. \n \nAdverse event data from clinical trial subjects showed a rate of event of discolouration of the nails, \nlips, skin and/or mucosa per patient year of exposure of 3.6%. The cumulative incidences of an event \nat 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of exposure are approximately 1%, 1.8%, 4.4%, 10.2% \nand 16.7% respectively. \n \nApproximately 30-40% of clinical trial subjects who were being treated with retigabine and underwent \na skin and/or ophthalmological examination had findings of discolouration of nails, lips, skin and/or \nmucosa or non-retinal ocular pigmentation, and approximately 15-30% of clinical trial subjects who \nwere being treated with retigabine and underwent an ophthalmological examination had retinal \npigmentation findings. In addition, cases of acquired vitelliform-type maculopathy have been \nidentified, both in clinical studies and as spontaneous reports. \n \nData from elderly patients indicates that they may be more likely to experience certain central nervous \nsystem events, including somnolence, amnesia, coordination abnormal, vertigo, tremor, balance \ndisorder, memory impairment and gait disturbance. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. \n \nRetigabine overdoses in excess of 2,500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to \nadverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, \naggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. \n \nIn a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) \noccurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias \nspontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as \nclinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as \nrecommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \nHaemodialysis has been shown to reduce the plasma concentrations of retigabine and NAMR by \napproximately 50%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPotassium channels are one of the voltage-gated ion channels found in neuronal cells and are \nimportant determinants of neuronal activity. In vitro studies indicate that retigabine acts primarily \nthrough opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises \nthe resting membrane potential and controls the sub-threshold electrical excitability in neurons, thus \npreventing the initiation of epileptiform action potential bursts. Mutations in the KCNQ channels \nunderlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The mechanism of \naction of retigabine on potassium channels has been well documented, however other mechanisms by \nwhich retigabine may assert an antiepileptic effect have yet to be fully elucidated. \n \nIn a range of seizure models, retigabine increased the threshold for seizure induction produced by \nmaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Retigabine \nalso displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models, for example, in the fully kindled state \nand in some cases during the kindling development. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing \nstatus epilepticus seizures in rodents with cobalt-induced epileptogenic lesions, and inhibiting tonic \nextensor seizures in genetically susceptible mice. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, \nhowever, is not known. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn rats, retigabine increased the sleep time induced by thiopental sodium from approximately 4 min to \n53 min, and the propofol-induced sleep time from approximately 8 min to 12 min. There was no effect \non sleep time induced by halothane or methohexital sodium. Retigabine may increase the duration of \nanaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nClinical efficacy of adjunctive retigabine therapy in partial onset seizures \n \nThree multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 1239 adult \npatients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset \nseizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that \nwere not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products, and more \nthan 75% of all patients were taking \u22652 concurrent antiepileptic medicinal products. Across all studies, \npatients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 22 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging \nfrom 8 to 12 per 28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or \n1,200 mg/day (see Table 1). During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience \u22654 partial \nonset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for \u226521 days. The duration of the \nmaintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were: \n- percentage change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to the \n\ndouble-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined) in all three studies \n- responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a \u226550% reduction in 28-day total \n\npartial seizure frequency) from baseline to the maintenance phase (Studies 301 and 302 only). \n \nRetigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical \nstudies (Table 1).  Retigabine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at 600 mg/day \n(one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies). \n \nThe studies were not designed to evaluate specific combinations of antiepileptic medicinal products. \nConsequently, the efficacy and safety of retigabine when taken concomitantly with antiepileptic \nmedicinal products that were less commonly used as background treatment in the clinical studies, \nincluding levetiracetam, has not been definitely shown. \n \nTable 1.

Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an \nintravenous dose is approximately 60%. \n \nAdministration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the overall extent of \nretigabine absorption, but food reduced the between-subject variability in Cmax (23%) compared to the \nfasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual \nclinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nDistribution \n \nRetigabine is approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to \n2 \u00b5g/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine is 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRetigabine is extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose is \nconverted to inactive N-glucuronides. Retigabine is also metabolised to an N-acetyl metabolite \n(NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. NAMR has antiepileptic activity, but is less potent \nthan retigabine in animal seizure models. \n \nThere is no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 \nenzymes.  Therefore, co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes is \nunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the \nmajor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, retigabine is unlikely to affect the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes through inhibition or \ninduction mechanisms. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nElimination \n \nElimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total \nof approximately 84% of the dose is recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), \nN-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active \nsubstance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine is excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of \napproximately 6 to 10 hours. The total clearance of retigabine from plasma following intravenous \ndosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg. \n \nLinearity \n \nRetigabine pharmacokinetics are essentially linear over the single-dose range of 25 to 600 mg in \nhealthy volunteers and up to 1,200 mg daily in patients with epilepsy, with no unexpected \naccumulation following repeated administration. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine AUC was increased by approximately 30% in volunteers with mild \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and by approximately 100% in volunteers \nwith moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min), relative to healthy \nvolunteers.  Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment but no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn a single-dose study in healthy volunteers and subjects with end stage renal disease, the retigabine \nAUC was increased by approximately 100% in the subjects with end stage renal disease relative to \nhealthy volunteers.  \n \nIn a second single-dose study in subjects with end stage renal disease receiving chronic haemodialysis \n(n= 8), initiation of dialysis at approximately 4 hours after a single dose of retigabine (100 mg) \nresulted in a median reduction in retigabine plasma concentrations of 52% from the start to end of \ndialysis. The percentage decrease in plasma concentration during dialysis ranged from 34% to 60% \nexcept for one subject who had a 17% reduction. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study, there were no clinically significant effects on retigabine AUC in volunteers \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6).  The retigabine AUC was increased by \napproximately 50% in volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) and by \napproximately 100% in volunteers with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9), relative to \nhealthy volunteers. Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, retigabine clearance increased with increasing body surface \narea. However, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful, and since retigabine is \ntitrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on \nthe basis of body weight. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine was eliminated more slowly by healthy elderly volunteers \n(66 to 82 years of age) relative to healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC \n(approximately 40 to 50%) and longer terminal half-life (30%) (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nGender \nThe results of a single-dose study showed that in young adult volunteers, retigabine Cmax was \napproximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age), \nretigabine Cmax was approximately 75% higher in females compared with males. When Cmax was \nnormalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and \n40% higher in elderly females compared with males. However, there was no apparent gender \ndifference in weight-normalized clearance, and since retigabine is titrated according to individual \npatient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of gender. \n \nRace \nA post-hoc analysis across multiple healthy volunteer studies demonstrated a 20% reduction in \nretigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. However, \nthis effect is not considered clinically significant, therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children below 12 years of age have not been investigated. \n \nAn open-label, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study in five subjects aged \nbetween 12 years to less than 18 years with partial onset seizures determined that the \npharmacokinetics of retigabine in adolescents were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of retigabine \nin adults.  However, efficacy and safety of retigabine have not been determined in adolescents. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMaximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects \nof retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure \nin these studies was generally less than that reached in humans at recommended clinical doses. \n \nDistension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis \nor other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder \ndistension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction \nwere seen clinically. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of genotoxicity or carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nRetigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. \n \nIn rats, retigabine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta resulting in tissue concentrations that \nwere similar in dams and foetuses. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of retigabine to pregnant animals \nduring the period of organogenesis. In a study of peri- and post-natal development in rats, retigabine \nwas associated with increased perinatal mortality following administration during pregnancy. In \naddition, there was a delay in auditory startle response development. These findings were apparent at \nexposure levels lower than those obtained with clinically recommended doses and were accompanied \nby maternal toxicities (including ataxia, hypokinesia, tremor and reduced body weight gain). The \nmaternal toxicities interfered with higher dosing of the dams and hence deduction of safety margins \nwith regard to human therapy.  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPurple, oblong, film-coated tablets of 8.1 mm x 18 mm, marked with \u201cRTG-400\u201d on one side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrobalt is indicated as adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without \nsecondary generalization in patients aged 18 years or older with epilepsy, where other appropriate \ncombinations with other medicinal products have proved inadequate or have not been tolerated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTrobalt must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance \nbetween efficacy and tolerability. \n \nThe maximum total daily starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter, the total daily \ndose is increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response \nand tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and \n1,200 mg/day. \n \nThe maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of doses higher than \n1,200 mg/day have not been established. \n \nIf patients miss one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they \nremember. \n \nAfter taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours should be allowed before the next dose and then the \nnormal dosing schedule should be resumed. \n \nWhen withdrawing Trobalt, the dose must be gradually reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nThere are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of retigabine in patients aged 65 years and \nabove. A reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in elderly patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nThe total daily starting dose is 150 mg/day and during the titration period the total daily dose should \nbe increased by a maximum of 150 mg every week, according to the individual patient response and \ntolerability. Doses greater than 900 mg/day are not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRetigabine and its metabolites are eliminated principally by renal excretion. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to \n80 ml/min; see section 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min; see section 5.2). The total \ndaily starting dose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily \ndose is increased by 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nFor patients with end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis, the three daily doses should be \ntaken as usual on the dialysis day. In addition, a single supplemental dose is recommended \nimmediately after haemodialysis. If breakthrough seizures occur towards the end of dialysis then an \nadditional supplemental dose may be considered at the start of subsequent dialysis sessions. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6; see \nsection 5.2). \n \nA 50% reduction in the initial and maintenance dose of Trobalt is recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score \u22657; see section 5.2). The total daily starting \ndose is 150 mg, and it is recommended that during the titration period, the total daily dose is increased \nby 50 mg every week, to a maximum total dose of 600 mg/day. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of retigabine in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established \n(see section 5.2). Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrobalt is for oral use. The tablets must be taken in three divided doses each day.  The tablets should \nbe swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or divided. \n \nTrobalt may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEye disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in long-\nterm clinical studies with retigabine,  sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes \nof the skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). Reversibility of retinal pigmentation \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nafter retigabine discontinuation has been reported in some subjects. The long-term prognosis of these \nfindings is currently unknown, but some of the reports have been associated with visual impairment. \n \nIn addition a distinct form of macular abnormality with features of vitelliform maculopathy (see \nsection 4.8) has also been identified, in most cases diagnosed with optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) imaging. The rate of progression of vitelliform maculopathy and its impact on retinal and \nmacular function and vision is unclear. Vision abnormalities (field constriction, loss of central \nsensitivity, and reduced visual acuity) have been reported.  \n \nAll patients should undergo comprehensive ophthalmological examinations at baseline and at least \nevery six months, which should include visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus \nphotography, and macular OCT imaging. If retinal pigment changes, vitelliform maculopathy or vision \nchanges are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of \nthe balance of benefits and risks. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. \n \nSkin disorders \n \nPigment changes (discolouration) of the skin, lips or nails have been reported in long-term clinical \nstudies with retigabine, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular \ntissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with \nTrobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. \n \nUrinary retention \n \nUrinary retention, dysuria and urinary hesitation were reported in controlled clinical studies with \nretigabine, generally within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 4.8). Trobalt must be used with \ncaution in patients at risk of urinary retention, and it is recommended that patients are advised about \nthe risk of these possible effects. \n \nQT interval \n \nA study of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects has demonstrated that retigabine titrated to 1,200 \nmg/day produced a QT-prolonging effect. A mean increase in Individual Corrected QT Interval (QTcI) \nof up to 6.7 ms (upper bound of 95% one-sided CI 12.6 ms) was observed within 3 hours of dosing. \nCaution should be taken when Trobalt is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase \nQT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive cardiac failure, ventricular \nhypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia and in patients initiating treatment who are 65 years \nof age and above. \n \nIn these patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded before initiation of \ntreatment with Trobalt and in those with a corrected QT interval >440ms at baseline, an ECG should \nbe recorded on reaching the maintenance dose. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \n \nConfusional state, psychotic disorders and hallucinations were reported in controlled clinical studies \nwith retigabine (see section 4.8).  These effects generally occurred within the first 8 weeks of \ntreatment, and frequently led to treatment withdrawal in affected patients. It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of these possible effects. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nSuicide risk \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \nretigabine. \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice if signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \n \nElderly patients may be at increased risk of central nervous system events, urinary retention and atrial \nfibrillation.  Trobalt must be used with caution in this population and a reduced initial and \nmaintenance dose is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWithdrawal seizures \n \nTrobalt must be withdrawn gradually to minimise the potential for rebound seizures.  It is \nrecommended that the Trobalt dose is reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns \nrequire an abrupt withdrawal (see section 4.2). \n \nLaboratory tests \n \nRetigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine \nbilirubin, which can result in falsely elevated readings. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOther antiepileptic medicinal products \n \nIn vitro data indicated a low potential for interaction with other antiepileptic medicinal products (see \nsection 5.2).  The drug interaction potential was, therefore, evaluated based on a pooled analysis \nacross clinical studies and whilst not considered as robust as stand-alone clinical interaction studies, \nthe results support the in vitro data. \n \nBased on these pooled data, retigabine did not cause clinically significant effects on the plasma trough \nconcentrations of the following antiepileptic medicinal products: \n- carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide. \n \nFurther, based on pooled data, there were no clinically significant effects of the following antiepileptic \nmedicinal products on retigabine pharmacokinetics: \n- lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate.   \n \nThis analysis also showed no clinically significant effect of the inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine \nand phenobarbital) on retigabine clearance. \n \nHowever, steady-state data from a limited number of patients in smaller phase II studies indicated that:  \n-  phenytoin can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 35% \n-  carbamazepine can reduce retigabine systemic exposure by 33% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \nInteraction with digoxin \n \nData from an in vitro study showed that the N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine (NAMR) inhibited \nP-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a concentration-dependent manner.  \n \nBased on a study conducted in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of retigabine (600-1,200 mg/day) \nresulted in a minor (8-18%) increase in digoxin AUC following a single oral dose of digoxin. The \nincrease did not appear to be dependent on retigabine dose and is not considered clinically relevant. \nThere was no meaningful change in digoxin Cmax. No dose adjustment of digoxin is needed. \n \nInteraction with anaesthetics \n \nTrobalt may increase the duration of anaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental \nsodium; see section 5.1). \n \nInteraction with alcohol \n \nCo-administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) with retigabine (200 mg) resulted in an increase in visual \nblurring in healthy volunteers. It is recommended that patients are advised about the possible effects \non vision if they take Trobalt with alcohol. \nOral contraceptives \n \nAt retigabine doses of up to 750 mg/day, there was no clinically significant effect of retigabine on the \npharmacokinetics of the estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestogen (norethindrone) components of the \noral contraceptive pill. In addition, there was no clinically significant effect of the low dose \ncombination oral contraceptive pill on the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nRisk related to antiepileptic medicinal products in general \nSpecialist advice should be given to women who are of childbearing potential. The need for treatment \nwith antiepileptic medicinal products should be reviewed when a woman is planning to become \npregnant. In women being treated for epilepsy, sudden discontinuation of antiepileptic medicine \ntherapy should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child.  \n \nThe risk of congenital malformations is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in the offspring of mothers \ntreated with antiepileptic medicinal products compared with the expected incidence in the general \npopulation of approximately 3%. The most frequently reported defects are cleft lip, cardiovascular \nmalformations and neural tube defects. Therapy with multiple antiepileptic medicinal products is \nassociated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than monotherapy and therefore \nmonotherapy should be used whenever possible. \n \nRisk related to Trobalt \nThere are no adequate data from the use of retigabine in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity because the plasma levels achieved in these studies \nwere less than those reached in humans at recommended doses (see section 5.3). In a developmental \nstudy in rats whose mothers were treated with retigabine during pregnancy, there was a delay in \nauditory startle response development of the offspring (see section 5.3). The clinical significance of \nthis finding is not known.  \n \nTrobalt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age, not using \ncontraception. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether retigabine is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of retagabine and/or its metabolites in breast milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Trobalt should be made \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Trobalt therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere were no treatment-related effects of retigabine on fertility in animal studies. However, the \nplasma levels achieved in these studies were less than those reached in humans at recommended doses \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe effect of retigabine on human fertility has not been established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, diplopia and blurred vision were reported in \ncontrolled clinical studies, particularly during titration (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients are advised about the risk of such adverse reactions at treatment initiation and following each \ntitration step, and that they are advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have established \nhow Trobalt affects them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn pooled safety data from three multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nadverse reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity, and were most commonly reported in \nthe first 8 weeks of treatment. There was an apparent dose-relationship for dizziness, somnolence, \nconfusional state, aphasia, coordination abnormal, tremor, balance disorder, memory impairment, gait \ndisturbance, blurred vision and constipation. \n \nAdverse reactions that were most frequently reported to lead to discontinuation were dizziness, \nsomnolence, fatigue and confusional state. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions: \n \nVery common: \u22651/10 \nCommon:  \u22651/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  \u22651/1,000 to <1/100 \nRare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000 \nVery rare: <1/10,000. \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n \n\nVery common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n \n\n Weight increased \nIncreased appetite \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n Confusional state \nPsychotic disorders \nHallucinations \nDisorientation \nAnxiety \n \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\nDizziness \nSomnolence \n \n\nAmnesia \nAphasia \nCoordination abnormal \nVertigo \nParaesthesia \nTremor \nBalance disorder \nMemory impairment \nDysphasia \nDysarthria \nDisturbance in attention \nGait disturbance \nMyoclonus \n \n\nHypokinesia \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nPigment changes \n(discolouration) \nof ocular tissues, \nincluding the \nretina, have been \nobserved after \nseveral years of \ntreatment.

The majority of events \noccurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was no apparent dose-relationship. \n \nIn retigabine-treated patients in the pooled dataset, confusional state was reported in 9% of patients, \nhallucinations in 2% of patients and psychotic disorders in 1% of patients (see section 4.4). The \nmajority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and there was an apparent \ndose-relationship for confusional state only. \n \nAdverse event data from clinical trial subjects showed a rate of event of discolouration of the nails, \nlips, skin and/or mucosa per patient year of exposure of 3.6%. The cumulative incidences of an event \nat 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of exposure are approximately 1%, 1.8%, 4.4%, 10.2% \nand 16.7% respectively. \n \nApproximately 30-40% of clinical trial subjects who were being treated with retigabine and underwent \na skin and/or ophthalmological examination had findings of discolouration of nails, lips, skin and/or \nmucosa or non-retinal ocular pigmentation, and approximately 15-30% of clinical trial subjects who \nwere being treated with retigabine and underwent an ophthalmological examination had retinal \npigmentation findings. In addition, cases of acquired vitelliform-type maculopathy have been \nidentified, both in clinical studies and as spontaneous reports. \n \nData from elderly patients indicates that they may be more likely to experience certain central nervous \nsystem events, including somnolence, amnesia, coordination abnormal, vertigo, tremor, balance \ndisorder, memory impairment and gait disturbance. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with retigabine. \n \nRetigabine overdoses in excess of 2,500 mg/day were reported during clinical studies. In addition to \nadverse reactions seen at therapeutic doses, symptoms of retigabine overdose included agitation, \naggressive behaviour and irritability. There were no reported sequelae. \n \nIn a study in volunteers, cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest/asystole or ventricular tachycardia) \noccurred in two subjects within 3 hours of receiving a single 900 mg retigabine dose. The arrhythmias \nspontaneously resolved, and both volunteers recovered without sequelae. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient is given appropriate supportive therapy as \nclinically indicated, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Further management should be as \nrecommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \nHaemodialysis has been shown to reduce the plasma concentrations of retigabine and NAMR by \napproximately 50%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX21. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPotassium channels are one of the voltage-gated ion channels found in neuronal cells and are \nimportant determinants of neuronal activity. In vitro studies indicate that retigabine acts primarily \nthrough opening neuronal potassium channels (KCNQ2 [Kv7.2] and KCNQ3 [Kv7.3]). This stabilises \nthe resting membrane potential and controls the sub-threshold electrical excitability in neurons, thus \npreventing the initiation of epileptiform action potential bursts. Mutations in the KCNQ channels \nunderlie several human inheritable disorders, including epilepsy (KCNQ2 and 3). The mechanism of \naction of retigabine on potassium channels has been well documented, however other mechanisms by \nwhich retigabine may assert an antiepileptic effect have yet to be fully elucidated. \n \nIn a range of seizure models, retigabine increased the threshold for seizure induction produced by \nmaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Retigabine \nalso displayed inhibitory properties in multiple kindling models, for example, in the fully kindled state \nand in some cases during the kindling development. In addition, retigabine was effective in preventing \nstatus epilepticus seizures in rodents with cobalt-induced epileptogenic lesions, and inhibiting tonic \nextensor seizures in genetically susceptible mice. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, \nhowever, is not known. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn rats, retigabine increased the sleep time induced by thiopental sodium from approximately 4 min to \n53 min, and the propofol-induced sleep time from approximately 8 min to 12 min. There was no effect \non sleep time induced by halothane or methohexital sodium. Retigabine may increase the duration of \nanaesthesia induced by some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nClinical efficacy of adjunctive retigabine therapy in partial onset seizures \n \nThree multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in a total of 1239 adult \npatients have been conducted to assess the efficacy of retigabine as adjunctive therapy of partial onset \nseizures, with or without secondary generalisation. All patients enrolled were to have had seizures that \nwere not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products, and more \nthan 75% of all patients were taking \u22652 concurrent antiepileptic medicinal products. Across all studies, \npatients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 22 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging \nfrom 8 to 12 per 28 days. Patients were randomized to placebo or retigabine at 600, 900 or \n1,200 mg/day (see Table 1). During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience \u22654 partial \nonset seizures per 28 days. Patients could not be seizure-free for \u226521 days. The duration of the \nmaintenance phase was 8 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoints were: \n- percentage change in the 28-day total partial seizure frequency from baseline to the \n\ndouble-blind phase (titration and maintenance phases combined) in all three studies \n- responder rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a \u226550% reduction in 28-day total \n\npartial seizure frequency) from baseline to the maintenance phase (Studies 301 and 302 only). \n \nRetigabine was effective in adjunctive treatment of adults with partial onset seizures in three clinical \nstudies (Table 1).  Retigabine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at 600 mg/day \n(one study), 900 mg/day (two studies) and 1,200 mg/day (two studies). \n \nThe studies were not designed to evaluate specific combinations of antiepileptic medicinal products. \nConsequently, the efficacy and safety of retigabine when taken concomitantly with antiepileptic \nmedicinal products that were less commonly used as background treatment in the clinical studies, \nincluding levetiracetam, has not been definitely shown. \n \nTable 1.

Absolute oral bioavailability of retigabine relative to an \nintravenous dose is approximately 60%. \n \nAdministration of retigabine with a high fat meal resulted in no change in the overall extent of \nretigabine absorption, but food reduced the between-subject variability in Cmax (23%) compared to the \nfasted state (41%), and led to an increase in Cmax (38%).  The effect of food on Cmax under usual \nclinical conditions is not expected to be clinically relevant.  Therefore Trobalt may be taken with or \nwithout food.  \n \nDistribution \n \nRetigabine is approximately 80% bound to plasma protein over the concentration range of 0.1 to \n2 \u00b5g/ml. The steady state volume of distribution of retigabine is 2 to 3 l/kg following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRetigabine is extensively metabolised in humans. A substantial fraction of the retigabine dose is \nconverted to inactive N-glucuronides. Retigabine is also metabolised to an N-acetyl metabolite \n(NAMR) that is also subsequently glucuronidated. NAMR has antiepileptic activity, but is less potent \nthan retigabine in animal seizure models. \n \nThere is no evidence for hepatic oxidative metabolism of retigabine or NAMR by cytochrome P450 \nenzymes.  Therefore, co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes is \nunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of retigabine or NAMR. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed little or no potential for retigabine to inhibit the \nmajor cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, retigabine and NAMR did not induce CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4/5 in human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, retigabine is unlikely to affect the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes through inhibition or \ninduction mechanisms. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\nElimination \n \nElimination of retigabine occurs via a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A total \nof approximately 84% of the dose is recovered in the urine, including the N-acetyl metabolite (18%), \nN-glucuronides of the parent active substance and of the N-acetyl metabolite (24%), or parent active \nsubstance (36%). Only 14% of retigabine is excreted in the faeces. Retigabine has a plasma half-life of \napproximately 6 to 10 hours. The total clearance of retigabine from plasma following intravenous \ndosing is typically 0.4 to 0.6 l/h/kg. \n \nLinearity \n \nRetigabine pharmacokinetics are essentially linear over the single-dose range of 25 to 600 mg in \nhealthy volunteers and up to 1,200 mg daily in patients with epilepsy, with no unexpected \naccumulation following repeated administration. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine AUC was increased by approximately 30% in volunteers with mild \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and by approximately 100% in volunteers \nwith moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min), relative to healthy \nvolunteers.  Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment but no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with mild renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn a single-dose study in healthy volunteers and subjects with end stage renal disease, the retigabine \nAUC was increased by approximately 100% in the subjects with end stage renal disease relative to \nhealthy volunteers.  \n \nIn a second single-dose study in subjects with end stage renal disease receiving chronic haemodialysis \n(n= 8), initiation of dialysis at approximately 4 hours after a single dose of retigabine (100 mg) \nresulted in a median reduction in retigabine plasma concentrations of 52% from the start to end of \ndialysis. The percentage decrease in plasma concentration during dialysis ranged from 34% to 60% \nexcept for one subject who had a 17% reduction. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a single-dose study, there were no clinically significant effects on retigabine AUC in volunteers \nwith mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6).  The retigabine AUC was increased by \napproximately 50% in volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) and by \napproximately 100% in volunteers with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9), relative to \nhealthy volunteers. Adjustment of the Trobalt dose is recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, retigabine clearance increased with increasing body surface \narea. However, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful, and since retigabine is \ntitrated according to individual patient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on \nthe basis of body weight. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nIn a single-dose study, retigabine was eliminated more slowly by healthy elderly volunteers \n(66 to 82 years of age) relative to healthy young adult volunteers, resulting in a higher AUC \n(approximately 40 to 50%) and longer terminal half-life (30%) (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\nGender \nThe results of a single-dose study showed that in young adult volunteers, retigabine Cmax was \napproximately 65% higher in females than in males, and in elderly volunteers (66 to 82 years of age), \nretigabine Cmax was approximately 75% higher in females compared with males. When Cmax was \nnormalized for weight, the values were approximately 30% higher in young females than in males and \n40% higher in elderly females compared with males. However, there was no apparent gender \ndifference in weight-normalized clearance, and since retigabine is titrated according to individual \npatient response and tolerability, dose-adjustments are not required on the basis of gender. \n \nRace \nA post-hoc analysis across multiple healthy volunteer studies demonstrated a 20% reduction in \nretigabine clearance in healthy black volunteers relative to healthy Caucasian volunteers. However, \nthis effect is not considered clinically significant, therefore no adjustment of the Trobalt dose is \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of retigabine in children below 12 years of age have not been investigated. \n \nAn open-label, multiple dose pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability study in five subjects aged \nbetween 12 years to less than 18 years with partial onset seizures determined that the \npharmacokinetics of retigabine in adolescents were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of retigabine \nin adults.  However, efficacy and safety of retigabine have not been determined in adolescents. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMaximum doses in repeat dose toxicity studies were limited by the exaggerated pharmacologic effects \nof retigabine (including ataxia, hypokinesia and tremor). At no observed effect levels, animal exposure \nin these studies was generally less than that reached in humans at recommended clinical doses. \n \nDistension of the gall bladder was seen in studies with dogs, but there was no evidence of cholestasis \nor other signs of gall bladder dysfunction, and bile ejection volume was unchanged. The gall bladder \ndistension in the dog resulted in focal compression of the liver. No signs of gall bladder dysfunction \nwere seen clinically. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of genotoxicity or carcinogenic \npotential. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nRetigabine had no effect on fertility or general reproductive performance. \n \nIn rats, retigabine and/or its metabolites crossed the placenta resulting in tissue concentrations that \nwere similar in dams and foetuses. \n \nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of retigabine to pregnant animals \nduring the period of organogenesis. In a study of peri- and post-natal development in rats, retigabine \nwas associated with increased perinatal mortality following administration during pregnancy. In \naddition, there was a delay in auditory startle response development. These findings were apparent at \nexposure levels lower than those obtained with clinically recommended doses and were accompanied \nby maternal toxicities (including ataxia, hypokinesia, tremor and reduced body weight gain). The \nmaternal toxicities interfered with higher dosing of the dams and hence deduction of safety margins \nwith regard to human therapy.  \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n6.

What Trobalt is and what it is used for \n \nTrobalt contains the active substance retigabine. Trobalt is one of a group of medicines called \nantiepileptics. It works by preventing the brain overactivity that causes epileptic seizures (also called \nfits). \n \nTrobalt is used to treat seizures that affect one part of the brain (partial seizure), which may or may not \nextend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (secondary generalisation).  It is used together with \nother anti-epileptic medicines to treat adults who continue to experience seizures and where other \ncombinations of antiepileptic medicines have not worked well. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Trobalt \n \nDo not take Trobalt \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to retigabine or any of the other ingredients of Trobalt (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Trobalt: \n\n\u2022 if you are 65 years of age or above. \n\u2022 if you have kidney or liver problems.  \n\nTell your doctor if any of these applies to you. The doctor may decide to give you a reduced dose. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\nLook out for serious symptoms  \nTrobalt can cause serious side effects, including an inability to pass urine (urinary retention) and \nmental health problems. You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Trobalt, to \nreduce the risk of any problems.

The eye \nexamination should be repeated at least every six months whilst taking Trobalt. Treatment will be \nstopped if any problems are found unless no other suitable treatments are available. Your doctor will \nmonitor you more closely if treatment with Trobalt is continued. \n \nTell your doctor if you experience any changes in vision whilst you are being treated with Trobalt. \n \nA blue-grey discolouration of the skin, lips or nails has also been reported in people taking Trobalt for \nseveral years (See Section 4).

You may need extra check-ups (including an \nelectrocardiogram [ECG], which is a test which records the electrical activity of your heart) while \nyou are taking Trobalt. \n\n \nThoughts of harming yourself or suicide \nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as Trobalt have had thoughts of \nharming or killing themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts,  \n\nImmediately contact your doctor. \n \nIf you need a blood or urine test  \nTrobalt can affect the results of some tests.

allergic to retigabine or any of the other ingredients of trobalt (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking trobalt: if you are 65 years of age or above. if you have kidney or liver problems. tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. the doctor may decide to give you a reduced dose. look out for serious symptoms trobalt can cause serious side effects, including an inability to pass urine (urinary retention) and mental health problems. you must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking trobalt, to reduce the risk of any problems. see 'look out for serious symptoms' in section 4. discolouration of skin, nails, lips and eyes, and eye disorders caused by changes in the centre of the retina (maculopathy) discolouration of parts of the eye, including the retina (inside the back of the eye) has been reported in people taking trobalt for several years (see section 4). eye disorders caused by changes in the centre of the retina (maculopathy) have been reported in people taking trobalt (see section 4). your doctor should recommend that you have an eye examination before starting treatment. the eye examination should be repeated at least every six months whilst taking trobalt. treatment will be stopped if any problems are found unless no other suitable treatments are available. your doctor will monitor you more closely if treatment with trobalt is continued. tell your doctor if you experience any changes in vision whilst you are being treated with trobalt. a blue-grey discolouration of the skin, lips or nails has also been reported in people taking trobalt for several years (see section 4). this sometimes occurs together with discolouration of parts of the eye. if you notice such changes while taking the medicine, tell your doctor. your doctor will discuss with you whether treatment with trobalt should be continued. heart conditions trobalt can affect heart rhythm. this is more likely to affect you: if you are taking other medicines if you have an existing heart problem if you have low potassium (hypokalaemia) or low magnesium (hypomagnesaemia) in your blood. if you are 65 years of age or above tell your doctor if any of these apply to you, or if you notice any unusual changes in your heart beat (such as beating too fast or too slow). you may need extra check-ups (including an electrocardiogram [ecg], which is a test which records the electrical activity of your heart) while you are taking trobalt. thoughts of harming yourself or suicide a small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as trobalt have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. if at any time you have these thoughts, immediately contact your doctor. if you need a blood or urine test trobalt can affect the results of some tests. if you need a blood or urine test: tell the person who orders the test that you are taking trobalt. children and adolescents trobalt is not recommended for children and adolescents aged under 18. the safety and efficacy are not yet known in this age group. other medicines and trobalt tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. trobalt may affect some anaesthetics (for example thiopental sodium). if you are going to have an operation under a general anaesthetic: tell the doctor that you are taking trobalt, well in advance. trobalt with alcohol drinking alcohol with trobalt can make your vision blurred. take extra care until you know how trobalt and alcohol affect you. pregnancy and breast-feeding there is no information about the safety of trobalt in pregnant women. therefore trobalt is not recommended during pregnancy.you must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are being treated with trobalt. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. do not stop treatment without discussing it with your doctor. the doctor will weigh up the benefit to you against any risk to your baby of taking trobalt while you are pregnant. it is not known whether the active substance of trobalt can pass into breast-milk. talk to your doctor about breast-feeding while you are taking trobalt. your doctor will weigh up the benefit to you against any risk to your baby of taking trobalt while you are breast-feeding. driving and using machines trobalt can make you feel dizzy or drowsy and cause double or blurred vision. don't drive or use machines until you know how trobalt affects you. you must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
