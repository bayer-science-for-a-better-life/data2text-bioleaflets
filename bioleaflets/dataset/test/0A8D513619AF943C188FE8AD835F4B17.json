PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear and colourless solution with a pH of 6.0-7.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nControlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm \ninjection (ICSI) cycle. \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility problems. \n \nPosology \nThe posology of REKOVELLE is individualised for each patient and aims to obtain an ovarian \nresponse which is associated with a favourable safety/efficacy profile, i.e. aims to achieve an adequate \nnumber of oocytes retrieved and reduce the interventions to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome (OHSS). REKOVELLE is dosed in micrograms (see section 5.1). The dosing regimen is \nspecific for REKOVELLE and the microgram dose cannot be applied to other gonadotropins. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nFor the first treatment cycle, the individual daily dose will be determined on the basis of the woman\u2019s \nserum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) concentration and her body weight. The dose should be based \non a recent determination of AMH (i.e. within the last 12 months) measured by the following \ndiagnostic test from Roche: ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay (see section 4.4). The individual \ndaily dose is to be maintained throughout the stimulation period. For women with AMH <15 pmol/L \nthe daily dose is 12 micrograms, irrespective of body weight. For women with AMH \u226515 pmol/L the \ndaily dose decreases from 0.19 to 0.10 micrograms/kg by increasing AMH concentration (Table 1). \nThe dose is to be rounded off to the nearest 0.33 micrograms to match the dosing scale on the injection \npen. The maximum daily dose for the first treatment cycle is 12 micrograms. \nFor calculation of the REKOVELLE dose, the body weight is to be measured without shoes and \novercoat just prior to start of stimulation. \n \nTable 1 Dosing regimen  \n\nAMH (pmol/L) <15 15-16 17 18 19-20 21-22 23-24 25-27 28-32 33-39 \u226540 \n\nFixed daily dose \nof REKOVELLE  \n\n12  0.19  0.18 0.17 0.16 0.15 0.14 0.13 0.12 0.11 0.10 \n\nmcg mcg/kg \n\nThe AMH concentration is to be expressed in pmol/L and is to be rounded off to the nearest integer. If \nthe AMH concentration is in ng/mL, the concentration should be converted to pmol/L by multiplying \nwith 7.14 (ng/mL x 7.14 = pmol/L) before use. \nmcg: micrograms \n \nTreatment with REKOVELLE should be initiated day 2 or 3 after start of menstrual bleeding, and \ncontinue until adequate follicular development (\u22653 follicles \u226517 mm) has been achieved, which on \naverage is by the ninth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms \nrecombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 5,000 IU hCG is administered to induce final \nfollicular maturation. In patients with excessive follicular development (of \u226525 follicles \u226512 mm), \ntreatment with REKOVELLE should be stopped and triggering of final follicular maturation with hCG \nshould not be performed. \n \nFor subsequent treatment cycles, the daily dose of REKOVELLE should be maintained or modified \naccording to the patient\u2019s ovarian response in the previous cycle. If the patient had adequate ovarian \nresponse in the previous cycle without developing OHSS, the same daily dose should be used. In case \nof ovarian hypo-response in the previous cycle, the daily dose in the subsequent cycle should be \nincreased by 25% or 50%, according to the extent of response observed. In case of ovarian hyper-\nresponse in the previous cycle, the daily dose in the subsequent cycle should be decreased by 20% or \n33%, according to the extent of response observed. In patients who developed OHSS or were at risk of \nOHSS in a previous cycle, the daily dose for the subsequent cycle is 33% lower than the dose used in \nthe cycle where OHSS or risk of OHSS occurred. The maximum daily dose is 24 micrograms. \n \nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of REKOVELLE in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \nhave not been specifically studied in clinical trials. Although limited, data did not indicate a need for a \ndifferent dosing regimen of REKOVELLE in this patient population (see section 4.4). \n \nPolycystic ovarian syndrome patients with anovulatory disorders \nAnovulatory patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome have not been studied. Ovulatory patients with \npolycystic ovaries have been included in clinical trials (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of REKOVELLE in the elderly population.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of REKOVELLE in the paediatric population. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nMethod of administration \nThe cartridge is designed to be used in conjunction with the REKOVELLE injection pen. \nREKOVELLE is intended for subcutaneous use, preferably in the abdominal wall. The first injection \nshould be performed under direct medical supervision. Patients must be educated on how to use the \nREKOVELLE injection pen and to perform injections. Self-administration should only be performed \nby patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the REKOVELLE injection pen, see the \u201dInstructions for \nUse\u201d supplied with the pen. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n\u2022 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n\u2022 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology (see section 4.4) \n\u2022 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma (see section 4.4) \n \nIn the following situations, treatment outcome is unlikely to be favourable, and therefore \nREKOVELLE should not be administered: \n\u2022 primary ovarian failure \n\u2022 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n\u2022 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nREKOVELLE contains a potent gonadotropic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires time commitment by physicians and supportive healthcare \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. Safe and effective use of \nREKOVELLE calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound alone, or in combination with \nmeasurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. The dose of REKOVELLE is individualised \nfor each patient to obtain an ovarian response with favourable safety/efficacy profile. There may be a \ndegree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with poor response to FSH in \nsome patients and exaggerated response in others.  \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple\u2019s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia, and the appropriate specific treatment should be given. \n \nUse of results obtained with other assays than the ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay from Roche for \nREKOVELLE dose determination is not recommended, as there currently is no standardisation of \navailable AMH assays. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth may experience ovarian enlargement and may be \nat risk of developing OHSS. Adherence to the REKOVELLE dose and regimen of administration and \ncareful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest \nitself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex \nsteroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the \nperitoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nIt is important to stress the value of careful and frequent monitoring of follicular development in order \nto reduce the risk of OHSS. The following symptoms may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: \nabdominal pain, discomfort and distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, \noliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation \nmay reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, \npleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be \ncomplicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic \nstroke or myocardial infarction. \n \nExcessive ovarian response to gonadotropin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is \nadministered to trigger final follicular maturation. Furthermore, the syndrome may be more severe and \nmore protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to \nwithhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for \nat least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious \nmedical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued. Also, as a \nconsequence of the hormonal changes during pregnancy, late development of OHSS can occur. \nBecause of the risk of developing OHSS patients should be followed for at least two weeks after \ntriggering of final follicular maturation.  \n \nThromboembolic events \nWomen with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, severe obesity (body mass \nindex >30 kg/m2) or thrombophilia may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic \nevents, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Treatment with gonadotropins may further \nincrease the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of \ngonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that \npregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nOvarian torsion \nOccurrence of ovarian torsion has been reported for ART cycles. It may be associated with other risk \nfactors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, \nprevious or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood \nsupply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nMultiple pregnancy carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In patients \nundergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of \nembryos replaced, their quality and the patient age, although twin pregnancy can in rare occasions \ndevelop from single embryo transfers. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple \nbirths before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing controlled \novarian stimulation for ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART has been reported to be higher than in the general population. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nOther medical conditions \nMedical conditions that contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment \nwith REKOVELLE. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nREKOVELLE has not been studied in patients with moderate/severe renal or hepatic impairment.  \n \nSodium content \nREKOVELLE contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with REKOVELLE. Clinically significant interactions \nwith other medicinal products have neither been reported during REKOVELLE therapy, nor are \nexpected.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nREKOVELLE is not indicated during pregnancy. No teratogenic risk has been reported, following \ncontrolled ovarian stimulation, in clinical use with gonadotropins. There are no data from the \ninadvertent exposure to REKOVELLE in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity with REKOVELLE doses above the recommended maximal dose in humans \n(section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nREKOVELLE is not indicated during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nREKOVELLE is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nREKOVELLE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with REKOVELLE are headache, \npelvic discomfort, OHSS, pelvic pain, nausea, adnexa uteri pain and fatigue. The frequency of these \nadverse reactions might decrease with repeated treatment cycles, as this has been observed in clinical \ntrials.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe table below (Table 2) displays the adverse reactions in patients treated with REKOVELLE in the \npivotal clinical trials according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency as follows: common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 Adverse reactions in pivotal clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ Class Common  (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon  \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Mood swings \n \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Somnolence  \nDizziness \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nAbdominal discomfort \n \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nOHSS \nPelvic pain \nAdnexa uteri pain \nPelvic discomfort \n\nVaginal haemorrhage \nBreast pain \nBreast tenderness \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nFatigue  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nOHSS is an intrinsic risk of the ovarian stimulation. Known gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nOHSS include abdominal pain, discomfort, and distension, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Ovarian \ntorsion and thromboembolic events are known to be rare complications of ovarian stimulation \ntreatment (see section 4.4).  \n \nImmunogenicity in terms of development of anti-FSH antibodies is a potential risk of gonadotropin \ntherapy (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effect of an overdose is unknown, nevertheless, there is a risk that OHSS may occur (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA10 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nMechanism of action \nThe most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of \nmultiple mature follicles. \n \nFollitropin delta is a recombinant human FSH. The amino acid sequences of the two FSH subunits in \nfollitropin delta are identical to the endogenous human FSH sequences. Because follitropin delta is \nproduced in the human cell line PER.C6, the glycosylation profile is different from follitropin alfa and \nfollitropin beta. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nFollowing daily administration of equal IU doses of REKOVELLE and follitropin alfa as determined \nin the rat in vivo bioassay (Steelman-Pohley assay), higher ovarian response (i.e. estradiol, inhibin B \nand follicular volume) was observed in patients after administration of REKOVELLE compared to \nfollitropin alfa. As the rat bioassay might not fully reflect the potency of the FSH in REKOVELLE in \nhumans, REKOVELLE is dosed in micrograms and not in IU.  \n \nThe number of oocytes retrieved increases with the dose of REKOVELLE and serum AMH \nconcentration. Conversely, increasing body weight leads to a decrease in the number of oocytes \nretrieved (only clinically relevant for REKOVELLE doses below 12 micrograms). The resulting \nREKOVELLE dosing regimen is in section 4.2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe ESTHER-1 trial was a randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial in 1,326 IVF/ICSI patients. \nThe trial compared the individualised dosing regimen of REKOVELLE where the daily dose is \nestablished for each patient and fixed throughout stimulation with no adjustments (see section 4.2) to \nfollitropin alfa filled-by-mass at a starting dose of 11 micrograms (150 IU) for the first five days \nfollowed by dose adjustments from day 6 of stimulation based on follicular development in a GnRH \nantagonist protocol. The patients were up to 40 years of age and had regular menstrual cycles \npresumed to be ovulatory. Single blastocyst transfer on day 5 was compulsory with the exception of \npatients 38-40 years in whom double blastocyst transfer was performed if no good-quality blastocysts \nwere available. The two co-primary endpoints were ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation \nrate in the fresh cycle, defined as at least one intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after transfer and \nnumber of intrauterine viable fetuses 10-11 weeks after transfer divided by number of blastocysts \ntransferred, respectively. \n \nThe trial demonstrated that REKOVELLE was at least as effective as follitropin alfa in terms of \nongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate, as shown in Table 3.  \n  \nTable 3 Ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate in ESTHER-1 trial  \n REKOVELLE in an \n\nindividualised dosing \nregimen  \n(N=665) \n\nFollitropin alfa  \n \n  \n(N=661) \n\nDifference [95% CI] \n\nOngoing pregnancy rate  30.7% 31.6% -0.9% [-5.9%; 4.1%] \nOngoing implantation rate  35.2% 35.8% -0.6% [-6.1%; 4.8%] \nPopulation: all randomised and exposed  \n \nThe impact of the AMH-based dosing regimen of REKOVELLE was also assessed in secondary \nendpoints, such as ovarian response and OHSS risk management. \n \nIn the overall trial population, the mean number of oocytes retrieved was 10.0 \u00b1 5.6 with \nREKOVELLE (N=636) in the individualised dosing regimen and 10.4 \u00b1 6.5 with follitropin alfa \n(N=643) at a starting dose of 150 IU followed by dose adjustments.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAmong patients with AMH \u226515 pmol/L, the ovarian response with REKOVELLE (N=355) and \nfollitropin alfa (N=353), respectively, was as follows: mean number of oocytes retrieved 11.6 \u00b1 5.9 \nand 13.3 \u00b1 6.9, and proportion of patients with \u226520 oocytes 10.1% (36/355) and 15.6% (55/353). \n \nIn ovulatory patients with polycystic ovaries, the incidence of early moderate/severe OHSS and/or \npreventive interventions for early OHSS was 7.7% with REKOVELLE and 26.7% with follitropin \nalfa.  \n \nSafety \u2013 immunogenicity \nAnti-FSH antibodies were measured pre-dosing and post-dosing in patients undergoing up to three \nrepeated treatment cycles with REKOVELLE (665 patients in cycle 1 in the ESTHER-1 trial as well \nas 252 patients in cycle 2 and 95 patients in cycle 3 in the ESTHER-2 trial). The incidence of anti-FSH \nantibodies after treatment with REKOVELLE was 1.1% in cycle 1, 0.8% in cycle 2 and 1.1% in \ncycle 3. These rates were similar to the incidence of pre-existing anti-FSH antibodies before exposure \nto REKOVELLE in cycle 1 which was 1.4%, and comparable to the incidences of anti-FSH antibodies \nafter treatment with follitropin alfa. In all patients with anti-FSH antibodies, titres were undetectable \nor very low and without neutralising capacity. Repeated treatment with REKOVELLE of patients with \npre-existing or treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies did not increase the antibody titre, was not \nassociated with decreased ovarian response, and did not induce immune-related adverse events. \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of follitropin delta has been investigated in healthy female subjects and in \nIVF/ICSI patients undergoing COS. Following repeated daily subcutaneous administrations, \nREKOVELLE reaches steady-state within 6 to 7 days with a threefold higher concentration compared \nwith the concentration after the first dose. Circulating levels of follitropin delta are inversely related to \nthe body weight, which supports individualised dosing based on body weight. Follitropin delta leads to \ngreater exposure than follitropin alfa. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter daily subcutaneous administration of REKOVELLE, the time to maximum serum concentration \nis 10 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 64%. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution is about 25 L after subcutaneous administration and the volume of \ndistribution at steady state is 9 L after intravenous administration. Within the therapeutic dose range, \nexposure to follitropin delta increases proportionally with the dose.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the apparent clearance of follitropin delta is 0.6 L/h and the \nclearance after intravenous is 0.3 L/h. The terminal elimination half-life after single subcutaneous \nadministration is 40 hours and after multiple subcutaneous administration is 28 hours. The apparent \nclearance for follitropin delta is low, i.e. 0.6 L/h after multiple subcutaneous administration, leading to \nhigh exposure. Follitropin delta is expected to be eliminated similarly to other follitropins, i.e. mainly \nby the kidneys. The fraction of follitropin delta excreted unchanged in the urine was estimated to 9%. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance. The overdose of follitropin delta resulted in \npharmacological or exaggerated pharmacological actions. Follitropin delta had a negative effect on \nfertility and early embryonic development in rats when administered in doses \u22650.8 micrograms/kg/day \nwhich is above the recommended maximal dose in humans. The relevance of these findings for the \nclinical use of REKOVELLE is limited. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nControlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted \nreproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm \ninjection (ICSI) cycle. \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nfertility problems. \n \nPosology \nThe posology of REKOVELLE is individualised for each patient and aims to obtain an ovarian \nresponse which is associated with a favourable safety/efficacy profile, i.e. aims to achieve an adequate \nnumber of oocytes retrieved and reduce the interventions to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome (OHSS). REKOVELLE is dosed in micrograms (see section 5.1). The dosing regimen is \nspecific for REKOVELLE and the microgram dose cannot be applied to other gonadotropins. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nFor the first treatment cycle, the individual daily dose will be determined on the basis of the woman\u2019s \nserum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) concentration and her body weight. The dose should be based \non a recent determination of AMH (i.e. within the last 12 months) measured by the following \ndiagnostic test from Roche: ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay (see section 4.4). The individual \ndaily dose is to be maintained throughout the stimulation period. For women with AMH <15 pmol/L \nthe daily dose is 12 micrograms, irrespective of body weight. For women with AMH \u226515 pmol/L the \ndaily dose decreases from 0.19 to 0.10 micrograms/kg by increasing AMH concentration (Table 1). \nThe dose is to be rounded off to the nearest 0.33 micrograms to match the dosing scale on the injection \npen. The maximum daily dose for the first treatment cycle is 12 micrograms. \nFor calculation of the REKOVELLE dose, the body weight is to be measured without shoes and \novercoat just prior to start of stimulation. \n \nTable 1 Dosing regimen  \n\nAMH (pmol/L) <15 15-16 17 18 19-20 21-22 23-24 25-27 28-32 33-39 \u226540 \n\nFixed daily dose \nof REKOVELLE  \n\n12  0.19  0.18 0.17 0.16 0.15 0.14 0.13 0.12 0.11 0.10 \n\nmcg mcg/kg \n\nThe AMH concentration is to be expressed in pmol/L and is to be rounded off to the nearest integer. If \nthe AMH concentration is in ng/mL, the concentration should be converted to pmol/L by multiplying \nwith 7.14 (ng/mL x 7.14 = pmol/L) before use. \nmcg: micrograms \n \nTreatment with REKOVELLE should be initiated day 2 or 3 after start of menstrual bleeding, and \ncontinue until adequate follicular development (\u22653 follicles \u226517 mm) has been achieved, which on \naverage is by the ninth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms \nrecombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 5,000 IU hCG is administered to induce final \nfollicular maturation. In patients with excessive follicular development (of \u226525 follicles \u226512 mm), \ntreatment with REKOVELLE should be stopped and triggering of final follicular maturation with hCG \nshould not be performed. \n \nFor subsequent treatment cycles, the daily dose of REKOVELLE should be maintained or modified \naccording to the patient\u2019s ovarian response in the previous cycle. If the patient had adequate ovarian \nresponse in the previous cycle without developing OHSS, the same daily dose should be used. In case \nof ovarian hypo-response in the previous cycle, the daily dose in the subsequent cycle should be \nincreased by 25% or 50%, according to the extent of response observed. In case of ovarian hyper-\nresponse in the previous cycle, the daily dose in the subsequent cycle should be decreased by 20% or \n33%, according to the extent of response observed. In patients who developed OHSS or were at risk of \nOHSS in a previous cycle, the daily dose for the subsequent cycle is 33% lower than the dose used in \nthe cycle where OHSS or risk of OHSS occurred. The maximum daily dose is 24 micrograms. \n \nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of REKOVELLE in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \nhave not been specifically studied in clinical trials. Although limited, data did not indicate a need for a \ndifferent dosing regimen of REKOVELLE in this patient population (see section 4.4). \n \nPolycystic ovarian syndrome patients with anovulatory disorders \nAnovulatory patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome have not been studied. Ovulatory patients with \npolycystic ovaries have been included in clinical trials (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nThere is no relevant use of REKOVELLE in the elderly population.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of REKOVELLE in the paediatric population. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nMethod of administration \nREKOVELLE is intended for subcutaneous use, preferably in the abdominal wall. The first injection \nshould be performed under direct medical supervision. Patients must be educated on how to use the \nREKOVELLE injection pen and to perform injections. Self-administration should only be performed \nby patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nFor instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see the \u201dInstructions for Use\u201d. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland \n\u2022 ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome \n\u2022 gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology (see section 4.4) \n\u2022 ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma (see section 4.4) \n \nIn the following situations, treatment outcome is unlikely to be favourable, and therefore \nREKOVELLE should not be administered: \n\u2022 primary ovarian failure \n\u2022 malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy \n\u2022 fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nREKOVELLE contains a potent gonadotropic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse \nreactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems \nand their management. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires time commitment by physicians and supportive healthcare \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. Safe and effective use of \nREKOVELLE calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound alone, or in combination with \nmeasurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. The dose of REKOVELLE is individualised \nfor each patient to obtain an ovarian response with favourable safety/efficacy profile. There may be a \ndegree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with poor response to FSH in \nsome patients and exaggerated response in others.  \n \nBefore starting treatment, the couple\u2019s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia, and the appropriate specific treatment should be given. \n \nUse of results obtained with other assays than the ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay from Roche for \nREKOVELLE dose determination is not recommended, as there currently is no standardisation of \navailable AMH assays. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth may experience ovarian enlargement and may be \nat risk of developing OHSS. Adherence to the REKOVELLE dose and regimen of administration and \ncareful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. \n \nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest \nitself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex \nsteroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the \nperitoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nIt is important to stress the value of careful and frequent monitoring of follicular development in order \nto reduce the risk of OHSS. The following symptoms may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: \nabdominal pain, discomfort and distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, \noliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation \nmay reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, \npleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be \ncomplicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic \nstroke or myocardial infarction. \n \nExcessive ovarian response to gonadotropin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is \nadministered to trigger final follicular maturation. Furthermore, the syndrome may be more severe and \nmore protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to \nwithhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for \nat least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious \nmedical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued. Also, as a \nconsequence of the hormonal changes during pregnancy, late development of OHSS can occur. \nBecause of the risk of developing OHSS patients should be followed for at least two weeks after \ntriggering of final follicular maturation.  \n \nThromboembolic events \nWomen with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, severe obesity (body mass \nindex >30 kg/m2) or thrombophilia may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic \nevents, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Treatment with gonadotropins may further \nincrease the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of \ngonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that \npregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n \nOvarian torsion \nOccurrence of ovarian torsion has been reported for ART cycles. It may be associated with other risk \nfactors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, \nprevious or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood \nsupply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nMultiple pregnancy carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In patients \nundergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of \nembryos replaced, their quality and the patient age, although twin pregnancy can in rare occasions \ndevelop from single embryo transfers. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple \nbirths before starting treatment. \n \nPregnancy loss \nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing controlled \novarian stimulation for ART than following natural conception. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART has been reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \nReproductive system neoplasms \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nCongenital malformation \nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nOther medical conditions \nMedical conditions that contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment \nwith REKOVELLE. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nREKOVELLE has not been studied in patients with moderate/severe renal or hepatic impairment.  \n \nSodium content \nREKOVELLE contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with REKOVELLE. Clinically significant interactions \nwith other medicinal products have neither been reported during REKOVELLE therapy, nor are \nexpected.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nREKOVELLE is not indicated during pregnancy. No teratogenic risk has been reported, following \ncontrolled ovarian stimulation, in clinical use with gonadotropins. There are no data from the \ninadvertent exposure to REKOVELLE in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity with REKOVELLE doses above the recommended maximal dose in humans \n(section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nREKOVELLE is not indicated during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nREKOVELLE is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nREKOVELLE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with REKOVELLE are headache, \npelvic discomfort, OHSS, pelvic pain, nausea, adnexa uteri pain and fatigue. The frequency of these \nadverse reactions might decrease with repeated treatment cycles, as this has been observed in clinical \ntrials.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe table below (Table 2) displays the adverse reactions in patients treated with REKOVELLE in the \npivotal clinical trials according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency as follows: common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions in pivotal clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ Class Common  (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon  \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Mood swings \n \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Somnolence  \nDizziness \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nAbdominal discomfort \n \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nOHSS \nPelvic pain \nAdnexa uteri pain \nPelvic discomfort \n\nVaginal haemorrhage \nBreast pain \nBreast tenderness \n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nFatigue  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nOHSS is an intrinsic risk of the ovarian stimulation. Known gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nOHSS include abdominal pain, discomfort, and distension, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Ovarian \ntorsion and thromboembolic events are known to be rare complications of ovarian stimulation \ntreatment (see section 4.4).  \n \nImmunogenicity in terms of development of anti-FSH antibodies is a potential risk of gonadotropin \ntherapy (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effect of an overdose is unknown, nevertheless, there is a risk that OHSS may occur (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA10 \n \nMechanism of action \nThe most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of \nmultiple mature follicles. \n \nFollitropin delta is a recombinant human FSH. The amino acid sequences of the two FSH subunits in \nfollitropin delta are identical to the endogenous human FSH sequences. Because follitropin delta is \nproduced in the human cell line PER.C6, the glycosylation profile is different from follitropin alfa and \nfollitropin beta. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nFollowing daily administration of equal IU doses of REKOVELLE and follitropin alfa as determined \nin the rat in vivo bioassay (Steelman-Pohley assay), higher ovarian response (i.e. estradiol, inhibin B \nand follicular volume) was observed in patients after administration of REKOVELLE compared to \nfollitropin alfa. As the rat bioassay might not fully reflect the potency of the FSH in REKOVELLE in \nhumans, REKOVELLE is dosed in micrograms and not in IU.  \n \nThe number of oocytes retrieved increases with the dose of REKOVELLE and serum AMH \nconcentration. Conversely, increasing body weight leads to a decrease in the number of oocytes \nretrieved (only clinically relevant for REKOVELLE doses below 12 micrograms). The resulting \nREKOVELLE dosing regimen is in section 4.2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe ESTHER-1 trial was a randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial in 1,326 IVF/ICSI patients. \nThe trial compared the individualised dosing regimen of REKOVELLE where the daily dose is \nestablished for each patient and fixed throughout stimulation with no adjustments (see section 4.2) to \nfollitropin alfa filled-by-mass at a starting dose of 11 micrograms (150 IU) for the first five days \nfollowed by dose adjustments from day 6 of stimulation based on follicular development in a GnRH \nantagonist protocol. The patients were up to 40 years of age and had regular menstrual cycles \npresumed to be ovulatory. Single blastocyst transfer on day 5 was compulsory with the exception of \npatients 38-40 years in whom double blastocyst transfer was performed if no good-quality blastocysts \nwere available. The two co-primary endpoints were ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation \nrate in the fresh cycle, defined as at least one intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after transfer and \nnumber of intrauterine viable fetuses 10-11 weeks after transfer divided by number of blastocysts \ntransferred, respectively. \n \nThe trial demonstrated that REKOVELLE was at least as effective as follitropin alfa in terms of \nongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate, as shown in Table 3.  \n  \nTable 3 Ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate in ESTHER-1 trial  \n REKOVELLE in an \n\nindividualised dosing \nregimen  \n(N=665) \n\nFollitropin alfa  \n \n  \n(N=661) \n\nDifference [95% CI] \n\nOngoing pregnancy rate  30.7% 31.6% -0.9% [-5.9%; 4.1%] \nOngoing implantation rate  35.2% 35.8% -0.6% [-6.1%; 4.8%] \nPopulation: all randomised and exposed  \n \nThe impact of the AMH-based dosing regimen of REKOVELLE was also assessed in secondary \nendpoints, such as ovarian response and OHSS risk management. \n \nIn the overall trial population, the mean number of oocytes retrieved was 10.0 \u00b1 5.6 with \nREKOVELLE (N=636) in the individualised dosing regimen and 10.4 \u00b1 6.5 with follitropin alfa \n(N=643) at a starting dose of 150 IU followed by dose adjustments.  \n \nAmong patients with AMH \u226515 pmol/L, the ovarian response with REKOVELLE (N=355) and \nfollitropin alfa (N=353), respectively, was as follows: mean number of oocytes retrieved 11.6 \u00b1 5.9 \nand 13.3 \u00b1 6.9, and proportion of patients with \u226520 oocytes 10.1% (36/355) and 15.6% (55/353). \n \nIn ovulatory patients with polycystic ovaries, the incidence of early moderate/severe OHSS and/or \npreventive interventions for early OHSS was 7.7% with REKOVELLE and 26.7% with follitropin \nalfa.  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nSafety \u2013 immunogenicity \nAnti-FSH antibodies were measured pre-dosing and post-dosing in patients undergoing up to three \nrepeated treatment cycles with REKOVELLE (665 patients in cycle 1 in the ESTHER-1 trial as well \nas 252 patients in cycle 2 and 95 patients in cycle 3 in the ESTHER-2 trial). The incidence of anti-FSH \nantibodies after treatment with REKOVELLE was 1.1% in cycle 1, 0.8% in cycle 2 and 1.1% in \ncycle 3. These rates were similar to the incidence of pre-existing anti-FSH antibodies before exposure \nto REKOVELLE in cycle 1 which was 1.4%, and comparable to the incidences of anti-FSH antibodies \nafter treatment with follitropin alfa. In all patients with anti-FSH antibodies, titres were undetectable \nor very low and without neutralising capacity. Repeated treatment with REKOVELLE of patients with \npre-existing or treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies did not increase the antibody titre, was not \nassociated with decreased ovarian response, and did not induce immune-related adverse events. \n \nThere is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of follitropin delta has been investigated in healthy female subjects and in \nIVF/ICSI patients undergoing COS. Following repeated daily subcutaneous administrations, \nREKOVELLE reaches steady-state within 6 to 7 days with a threefold higher concentration compared \nwith the concentration after the first dose. Circulating levels of follitropin delta are inversely related to \nthe body weight, which supports individualised dosing based on body weight. Follitropin delta leads to \ngreater exposure than follitropin alfa. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter daily subcutaneous administration of REKOVELLE, the time to maximum serum concentration \nis 10 hours. The absolute bioavailability is about 64%. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution is about 25 L after subcutaneous administration and the volume of \ndistribution at steady state is 9 L after intravenous administration. Within the therapeutic dose range, \nexposure to follitropin delta increases proportionally with the dose.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the apparent clearance of follitropin delta is 0.6 L/h and the \nclearance after intravenous is 0.3 L/h. The terminal elimination half-life after single subcutaneous \nadministration is 40 hours and after multiple subcutaneous administration is 28 hours. The apparent \nclearance for follitropin delta is low, i.e. 0.6 L/h after multiple subcutaneous administration, leading to \nhigh exposure. Follitropin delta is expected to be eliminated similarly to other follitropins, i.e. mainly \nby the kidneys. The fraction of follitropin delta excreted unchanged in the urine was estimated to 9%. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance. The overdose of follitropin delta resulted in \npharmacological or exaggerated pharmacological actions. Follitropin delta had a negative effect on \nfertility and early embryonic development in rats when administered in doses \u22650.8 micrograms/kg/day \nwhich is above the recommended maximal dose in humans. The relevance of these findings for the \nclinical use of REKOVELLE is limited. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nREKOVELLE 12 micrograms/0.36 mL solution for injection \nfollitropin delta \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n \nREKOVELLE contains follitropin delta, a follicle stimulating hormone which belongs to the family of \nhormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nREKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted \nreproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection \n(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs (\u2018follicles\u2019), from \nwhich eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n \nBefore starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible \ncauses of your fertility problems. \n \nDo not use REKOVELLE if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus \n\u2022 you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian \n\ndisease) \n\u2022 you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause \n\u2022 you have had an early menopause \n\u2022 you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible \n\u2022 you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nGonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and at the dose your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level \nof anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with \ngonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample \n(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight \nwill also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or \ndecrease your daily dose.

What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n \nREKOVELLE contains follitropin delta, a follicle stimulating hormone which belongs to the family of \nhormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nREKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted \nreproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection \n(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs (\u2018follicles\u2019), from \nwhich eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n \nBefore starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible \ncauses of your fertility problems. \n \nDo not use REKOVELLE if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus \n\u2022 you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian \n\ndisease) \n\u2022 you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause \n\u2022 you have had an early menopause \n\u2022 you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible \n\u2022 you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nGonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3.

What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n \nREKOVELLE contains follitropin delta, a follicle stimulating hormone which belongs to the family of \nhormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nREKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted \nreproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection \n(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs (\u2018follicles\u2019), from \nwhich eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n \nBefore starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible \ncauses of your fertility problems. \n \nDo not use REKOVELLE if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus \n\u2022 you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian \n\ndisease) \n\u2022 you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause \n\u2022 you have had an early menopause \n\u2022 you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible \n\u2022 you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nGonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and at the dose your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level \nof anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with \ngonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample \n(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight \nwill also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or \ndecrease your daily dose. Your doctor will monitor the effect of REKOVELLE treatment, and \ntreatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. In general, you will be given \na single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of \n250 micrograms or 5,000 IU for final development of the follicles. \n \nIf your body\u00b4s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment with REKOVELLE. For the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you \neither a higher or a lower daily dose of REKOVELLE than before. \n \nHow are injections given \n \nREKOVELLE is developed for use in the REKOVELLE injection pen. The instructions for using the \ninjection pen supplied with the pen including loading the cartridge must be followed carefully. Do not \nuse the cartridge if the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. \n \nThe first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. Your \ndoctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after \nreceiving adequate training. \n \nThis medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. \nThe cartridge may be used for several injections. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nIf you use more REKOVELLE than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nmay possibly occur, which is described in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to use REKOVELLE \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor as soon as you \nnotice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \n \nHormones used in the treatment of infertility such as this medicine may cause a high level of activity \nin the ovaries (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). Symptoms may include pain, discomfort or \nswelling of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight gain or difficulty breathing. If you have \nany of these symptoms you should contact a doctor immediately. \n \nThe risk of having a side effect is described by the following categories: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see above) \n\u2022 Pelvic pain and discomfort, including of ovarian origin \n\u2022 Tiredness (fatigue) \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\u2022 Mood swings \n\u2022 Sleepiness/drowsiness \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\u2022 Constipation \n\u2022 Discomfort of the abdomen \n\u2022 Vaginal bleeding \n\u2022 Breast complaints (include breast pain, breast tenderness) \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n64 \n\n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the cartridge label and carton after \nEXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in refrigerator (2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C).

This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and at the dose your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level \nof anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with \ngonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample \n(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight \nwill also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or \ndecrease your daily dose. Your doctor will monitor the effect of REKOVELLE treatment, and \ntreatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. In general, you will be given \na single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of \n250 micrograms or 5,000 IU for final development of the follicles. \n \nIf your body\u00b4s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment with REKOVELLE. For the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you \neither a higher or a lower daily dose of REKOVELLE than before. \n \nHow are injections given \nThe instructions for using the pre-filled pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the pre-filled pen \nif the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. \n \nThe first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. Your \ndoctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after \nreceiving adequate training. \n \nThis medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. \nThe pre-filled pen may be used for several injections. \n \nIf you use more REKOVELLE than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nmay possibly occur, which is described in section 4. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nIf you forget to use REKOVELLE \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor as soon as you \nnotice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \n \nHormones used in the treatment of infertility such as this medicine may cause a high level of activity \nin the ovaries (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). Symptoms may include pain, discomfort or \nswelling of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight gain or difficulty breathing. If you have \nany of these symptoms you should contact a doctor immediately. \n \nThe risk of having a side effect is described by the following categories: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see above) \n\u2022 Pelvic pain and discomfort, including of ovarian origin \n\u2022 Tiredness (fatigue) \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\u2022 Mood swings \n\u2022 Sleepiness/drowsiness \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\u2022 Constipation \n\u2022 Discomfort of the abdomen \n\u2022 Vaginal bleeding \n\u2022 Breast complaints (include breast pain, breast tenderness) \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

There may be new information. Follow the instructions carefully even if you have used a \nsimilar injection pen before. Using the pen incorrectly could result in receiving an incorrect dose of \nmedicine.  \nCall your healthcare provider (doctor, nurse or pharmacist) if you have any questions about how to \ngive your REKOVELLE injection.   \n \nThe REKOVELLE pre-filled pen is a disposable, dial-a-dose pen that can be used to give more than \n1 dose of REKOVELLE. The pen is available in 3 different strengths: \n\u2022 12 micrograms/0.36 mL \n\u2022 36 micrograms/1.08 mL \n\u2022 72 micrograms/2.16 mL \n \n \nREKOVELLE pre-filled pen and its parts \n \n\n \n \n \nInstructions for use \u2013 REKOVELLE (follitropin delta) pre-filled pen \n \nImportant information \n\u2022 The REKOVELLE pre-filled pen and the needles are for use by only one person and should not \n\nbe shared with others.  \n\u2022 Use the pen only for the medical condition it is prescribed for and as directed by your healthcare \n\nprovider.  \n\u2022 If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose scale on the pen, do not use this \n\npen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen.  \n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider or local representative of the marketing authorisation holder \n\n(please refer to pa-tient information leaflet for contact details) before giving your REKOVELLE \ninjection if you have questions.  \n\n  \nInformation about your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen \nThe pen can be dialed to give doses from 0.33 micrograms to 20 micrograms of REKOVELLE in \nmarked increments of 0.33 micrograms. See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n\u2022 The dose scale of the pen is numbered from 0 to 20 micrograms.  \n\u2022 Each number is separated by two lines, each line is equal to one increment of 0.33 micrograms.  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\u2022 When turning the dial to your dose, you will hear a click sound and feel resistance on the dial \nfor each increment to help you dial the correct dose. \n\n  \nCleaning \n\u2022 If needed, the outside of your pen may be cleaned with a cloth moistened with water.  \n\u2022 Do not put the pen in water or any other liquid. \n \nStorage  \n\u2022 Always store the pen with the pen cap on and without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Do not use the pen after the month of expiration (EXP) printed on the pen label.  \n\u2022 Do not store the pen in extreme temperatures, direct sunlight or very cold conditions, such as in \n\na car or freezer. \n\u2022 Store the pen out of the reach of children and anyone who has not been trained to use the pen. \n  \n\nBefore use: \n\u2022 Store the pen in a refrigerator at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. Do not freeze. \n\u2022 If stored outside the refrigerator (at 2 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C), the pen will last up to 3 months \n\nincluding the in-use period. Throw away (dispose of) the pen if it has not been used after \n3 months. \n\n \nAfter first use (in-use period): \n\u2022 The pen may be stored for up to 28 days at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C.  \n\n \nSupplies you will need to give your REKOVELLE injection \n \n\n \n \nBefore use \u2013 (Step 1) \nStep 1:  \n\u2022 Wash your hands. \n\u2022 Check the pen to see that it is not damaged. Do not use the pen if it is damaged. \n\u2022 Check the pen (cartridge) to see that the medicine is clear and does not contain particles. Do not \n\nuse a pen with particles or unclear medicine in the cartridge.  \n\u2022 Make sure you have the correct pen with correct strength. \n\u2022 Check the expiration on the pen label. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nAttaching needle \u2013 (Step 2 to 6) \n \nImportant: \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. \n\u2022 Only use the single-use click-on needles supplied with the pen. \n \nStep 2: \n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 3: \n\u2022 Pull off the protective foil from the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 4: \n\u2022 Click on the needle. \n\u2022 You will hear or feel a click when the needle is safely on. \n\u2022 You may also screw on the needle. When you feel a light resistance it is safely on. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 5: \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap. \n\u2022 Do not throw the outer needle cap away. You will need it to throw away (dispose of) the needle \n\nafter injecting the medicine. \n \n\n \n \nStep 6: \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nPriming \u2013 (Step 7 to 9) \n \n\u2022 Before using the pen for the first time, you need to remove air bubbles from the cartridge \n\n(Priming) to receive the correct dose of medicine.  \n\u2022 Only prime your pen the first time you use it.  \n\u2022 Perform Step 7 to 9 even if you do not see air bubbles. \n\u2022 If the pen has already been used proceed directly to Step 10. \n \nStep 7: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until a symbol of a droplet lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 If you dial the incorrect priming dose, the priming dose can be corrected either up or down \n\nwithout loss of medicine by turning the dose knob in either direction until the symbol of a \ndroplet lines up with the dose indicator. \n \n\n \n \nStep 8: \n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.  \n\n\u2022 Tap with your finger on the cartridge holder to make any air bubbles in the cartridge rise to the \ntop of the cartridge. \n \n\n \n \nStep 9: \n\u2022 With the needle still pointing upwards (away from the face) press in the injection button all the \n\nway in until you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Check that a droplet of liquid appears at the tip of the needle.  \n\u2022 If no droplet(s) appear repeat Steps 7 to 9 (Priming) until a droplet appears. \n\u2022 If no droplet appears after 5 tries, remove the needle (See Step 13), attach a new needle  \n\n(See Steps 3 to 6), and repeat priming (See Steps 7 to 9).  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nDialing the dose \u2013 (Step 10) \n \nSee \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n \nStep 10: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until the prescribed dose lines up with the dose indicator in the \n\ndose display window. \n\u2022 The dose can be corrected either up or down without loss of medicine by turning the dose knob \n\nin either direction until the correct dose lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Do not press the injection button when dialing the dose to avoid loss of medicine. \n \n\n \n \nSplit-dosing: \n\u2022 You may need more than one pen to complete your prescribed dose. \n\u2022 If you are not able to dial your complete dose, this means there is not enough medicine left in \n\nthe pen. You will need to give a split-dose injection or throw away (dispose of) your current pen \nand use a new pen for your injection.  \n\n \nSee \u201cGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE\u201c at Page 22 to 231 for examples of how to calculate and \nrecord your split dose. \n \n \nInjecting the dose \u2013 (Step 11 to 12) \n \nImportant:  \n\u2022 Do not use the pen if the medicine contains particles or if the medicine is not clear.  \n\u2022 Read Step 11 and 12 at Page 14 to 151 before giving your injection. \n\u2022 This medicine should be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) in the  \n\nstomach-area (abdomen).  \n\u2022 Use a new injection site for each injection to lower the risk of skin reactions as redness and \n\nirritation. \n\u2022 Do not inject into an area that is sore (tender), bruised, red, hard, scarred or where you have \n\nstretch marks. \n \nStep 11 and 12: \n\u2022 Wipe the skin of your injection site with an alcohol swab to clean it. Do not touch this area \n\nagain before you give your injection. \n\u2022 Hold the pen so the dose display window is visible during injection.  \n\u2022 Pinch your skin and insert the needle straight into your skin as shown by your healthcare \n\nprovider. Do not touch the injection button yet. \n\u2022 After the needle is inserted, place your thumb on the injection button.  \n\u2022 Press the injection button all the way in and hold.  \n\u2022 Keep pressing the injection button in and when you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose \n\nindicator, wait for 5 seconds (slowly count to 5). This will make sure you get your full dose. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\u2022 After pressing in the injection button for 5 seconds, release the injection button. Then slowly \n\nremove the needle from the injection site by pulling it straight out of the skin. \n\u2022 If blood appears at the injection site, press a gauze pad or cotton ball lightly to the injection site. \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Do not tilt the pen during injection and removal from skin.  \n\u2022 Tilting the pen can cause the needle to bend or break off.  \n\u2022 If a broken needle remains stuck in the body or remains under the skin, get medical help right \n\naway. \n \n \nDisposal of Needle \u2013 (Step 13) \n \nStep 13: \n\u2022 Carefully replace the outer needle cap over the needle with a firm push (A). \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle in counter-clockwise direction to remove the needle from the pen (B+C).  \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the used needle carefully (D). \n\u2022 See \u201cDisposal\u201d at Page 181.    \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Always remove the needle after every use. The needles are for single-use only. \n\u2022 Do not store the pen with the needle attached. \n \n \nReplace pen cap \u2013 (Step 14) \n \nStep 14: \n\u2022 Firmly replace the pen cap on the pen for protection between injections. \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 The pen cap will not fit over a needle. \n\u2022 If you will give a split-dose injection, only throw away (dispose of) the pen when it is empty.  \n\u2022 If you will use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose instead of giving a split-dose \n\ninjection, throw away (dispose of) your pen when there is not enough medicine in the pen for a \nfull dose. \n\n\u2022 Keep the pen cap on the pen when it is not in use. \n \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nDisposal \n \nNeedles: \nPut your used needles in a puncture-resistant container, such as a sharps disposal container right away \nafter use. Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash. \n \nIf you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:  \n\u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic,  \n\u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,  \n\u2022 upright and stable during use,  \n\u2022 leak-resistant, and  \n\u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.  \n \nWhen your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community \nguidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local \nlaws about how you should throw away used needles. \n \nREKOVELLE pre-filled pens: \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) your used pens in accordance with local waste regulations. \n \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose using your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen  \nThe chart below shows examples of prescribed doses, how to dial the examples of prescribed doses, \nand what the dose display window looks like for the prescribed doses.   \n \nExamples of \nprescribed dose  \n(in micrograms) \n\nDose to dial on pen Dose display window for example of prescribed dose \n\n0.33 0 and 1 line  (Dial to 0 plus 1 click) \n \n\n0.66 (priming dose) 0 and 2 lines  (Dial to 0 plus 2 clicks) \n\n \n\n2.33 2 and 1 line  (Dial to 2 plus 1 click) \n \n\n11.00 11 (Dial to 11) \n \n\n12.33 12 and 1 line  (Dial to 12 plus 1 click) \n \n\n18.66 18 and 2 lines  (Dial to 18 plus 2 clicks) \n \n\n20.00 20 (Dial to 20) \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE \n \nIf you are not able to dial the full prescribed dose in your pen, this means that there is not enough \nmedicine left in the pen to give the full dose. You will need to give part of your prescribed dose using \nyour current pen and the remainder of the dose using a new pen (split-dose injection) or you may \nthrow away (dispose of) the pen you are using and use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose in \n1 injection. If you decide to give a split-dose injection, follow these instructions and write down how \nmuch medicine to give using the split-dose diary on Page 231. \n \n\u2022 Column A shows an example of a prescribed dose. Write down your prescribed dose in column \n\nA. \n\u2022 Column B shows an example of the dose that is left in the pen (this is equal to what you are able \n\nto dial). \n\u2022 Write down the dose that is left in your pen in column B. Give the injection using the rest of the \n\nmedicine that is left in your pen. \n\u2022 Prepare and prime a new pen (Step 1 to 9).  \n\u2022 Calculate and write down the remaining dose to inject in column C by subtracting the number in \n\ncolumn B from the number in column A. Use a calculator to check your math if needed. \n\u2022 See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211 if needed. \n\u2022 Doses should be rounded off to nearest increment, X.00, X.33 or X.66 micrograms. For \n\nexample, if the number in column C is 5.34, round your remaining dose to 5.33. If the number \nin column C is 9.67, round your remaining dose to 9.66.  \n\n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider if you have questions about how to calculate your split-dose. \n\u2022 Inject the remaining dose of medicine (the number in column C) using your new pen to \n\ncomplete your prescribed dose. \n \nSplit-dose diary \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \n \n1. Is the priming step necessary before each injection? \n\n\u2022 No. Priming must be performed only before giving the first injection with a new pen.  \n \n2. How do I know that the injection is complete? \n\n\u2022 The injection button is firmly pushed in all the way until it stops. \n\u2022 The number \u20180\u2019 is lined up with the dose indicator. \n\u2022 You have slowly counted to 5 while you are still holding the injection button in and the \n\nneedle is still in your skin. \n \n3. Why do I have to count to 5 while holding the injection button? \n\n\u2022 Holding the injection button for 5 seconds allows for the full dose to be injected and \nabsorbed under your skin. \n\n \n4. What if the dose knob cannot be turned to the required dose? \n\n\u2022 The cartridge in the pen may not have enough medicine left to deliver the prescribed \ndose. \n\n\u2022 The pen does not allow you to dial a larger dose than the dose that is left in the cartridge. \n\u2022 You can inject the medicine left in the pen and complete the prescribed dose with a new \n\npen (split-dose) or use a new pen to give the full prescribed dose. \n \n \nWarnings \n \n\u2022 Do not use a pen if it has been dropped or hit against hard surfaces.  \n\u2022 If the injection button is not easy to push in, do not use force. Change the needle. If the injection \n\nbutton still is not easy to push in after changing the needle, use a new pen.  \n\u2022 Do not try to repair a damaged pen. If a pen is damaged, contact your healthcare provider or \n\nlocal representative of the marketing authorisation holder (please refer to patient information \nleaflet for contact details). \n\n \n \nAdditional information \n \nNeedles \nNeedles are supplied with your pen. If you need additional needles contact your healthcare provider. \nUse only needles that come with your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen or that your healthcare provider \nprescribes. \n \nContact \nIf you have any questions or problems related to the pen, contact your healthcare provider or local \nrepresentative of the marketing authorisation holder (please refer to patient information leaflet for \ncontact details). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1.

What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n \nREKOVELLE contains follitropin delta, a follicle stimulating hormone which belongs to the family of \nhormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nREKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted \nreproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection \n(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs (\u2018follicles\u2019), from \nwhich eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n \nBefore starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible \ncauses of your fertility problems. \n \nDo not use REKOVELLE if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus \n\u2022 you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian \n\ndisease) \n\u2022 you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause \n\u2022 you have had an early menopause \n\u2022 you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible \n\u2022 you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. \n\n\n\n84 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nGonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect you\u2019re ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and at the dose your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level \nof anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with \ngonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample \n(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight \nwill also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or \ndecrease your daily dose. Your doctor will monitor the effect of REKOVELLE treatment, and \ntreatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. In general, you will be given \na single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of \n250 micrograms or 5,000 IU for final development of the follicles. \n \nIf your body\u00b4s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment with REKOVELLE. For the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you \neither a higher or a lower daily dose of REKOVELLE than before. \n \nHow are injections given \nThe instructions for using the pre-filled  pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the pre-filled pen \nif the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. \n \nThe first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. Your \ndoctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after \nreceiving adequate training. \n \nThis medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. \nThe pre-filled pen may be used for several injections. \n \nIf you use more REKOVELLE than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nmay possibly occur, which is described in section 4. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nIf you forget to use REKOVELLE \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor as soon as you \nnotice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \n \nHormones used in the treatment of infertility such as this medicine may cause a high level of activity \nin the ovaries (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). Symptoms may include pain, discomfort or \nswelling of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight gain or difficulty breathing. If you have \nany of these symptoms you should contact a doctor immediately. \n \nThe risk of having a side effect is described by the following categories: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see above) \n\u2022 Pelvic pain and discomfort, including of ovarian origin \n\u2022 Tiredness (fatigue) \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\u2022 Mood swings \n\u2022 Sleepiness/drowsiness \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\u2022 Constipation \n\u2022 Discomfort of the abdomen \n\u2022 Vaginal bleeding \n\u2022 Breast complaints (include breast pain, breast tenderness) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen.  \n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider or local representative of the marketing authorisation holder \n\n(please refer to pa-tient information leaflet for contact details) before giving your REKOVELLE \ninjection if you have questions.  \n\n  \nInformation about your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen \nThe pen can be dialed to give doses from 0.33 micrograms to 20 micrograms of REKOVELLE in \nmarked increments of 0.33 micrograms. See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n\u2022 The dose scale of the pen is numbered from 0 to 20 micrograms.  \n\u2022 Each number is separated by two lines, each line is equal to one increment of 0.33 micrograms.  \n\n\n\n91 \n\n\u2022 When turning the dial to your dose, you will hear a click sound and feel resistance on the dial \nfor each increment to help you dial the correct dose. \n\n  \nCleaning \n\u2022 If needed, the outside of your pen may be cleaned with a cloth moistened with water.  \n\u2022 Do not put the pen in water or any other liquid. \n \nStorage  \n\u2022 Always store the pen with the pen cap on and without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Do not use the pen after the month of expiration (EXP) printed on the pen label.  \n\u2022 Do not store the pen in extreme temperatures, direct sunlight or very cold conditions, such as in \n\na car or freezer. \n\u2022 Store the pen out of the reach of children and anyone who has not been trained to use the pen. \n  \n\nBefore use: \n\u2022 Store the pen in a refrigerator at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. Do not freeze. \n\u2022 If stored outside the refrigerator (at 2 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C), the pen will last up to 3 months \n\nincluding the in-use period. Throw away (dispose of) the pen if it has not been used after \n3 months. \n\n \nAfter first use (in-use period): \n\u2022 The pen may be stored for up to 28 days at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C.  \n\n \nSupplies you will need to give your REKOVELLE injection \n \n\n \n \nBefore use \u2013 (Step 1) \nStep 1:  \n\u2022 Wash your hands. \n\u2022 Check the pen to see that it is not damaged. Do not use the pen if it is damaged. \n\u2022 Check the pen (cartridge) to see that the medicine is clear and does not contain particles. Do not \n\nuse a pen with particles or unclear medicine in the cartridge.  \n\u2022 Make sure you have the correct pen with correct strength. \n\u2022 Check the expiration on the pen label. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nAttaching needle \u2013 (Step 2 to 6) \n \nImportant: \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. \n\u2022 Only use the single-use click-on needles supplied with the pen. \n \nStep 2: \n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 3: \n\u2022 Pull off the protective foil from the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 4: \n\u2022 Click on the needle. \n\u2022 You will hear or feel a click when the needle is safely on. \n\u2022 You may also screw on the needle. When you feel a light resistance it is safely on. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 5: \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap. \n\u2022 Do not throw the outer needle cap away. You will need it to throw away (dispose of) the needle \n\nafter injecting the medicine. \n \n\n \n \nStep 6: \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\nPriming \u2013 (Step 7 to 9) \n \n\u2022 Before using the pen for the first time, you need to remove air bubbles from the cartridge \n\n(Priming) to receive the correct dose of medicine.  \n\u2022 Only prime your pen the first time you use it.  \n\u2022 Perform Step 7 to 9 even if you do not see air bubbles. \n\u2022 If the pen has already been used proceed directly to Step 10. \n \nStep 7: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until a symbol of a droplet lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 If you dial the incorrect priming dose, the priming dose can be corrected either up or down \n\nwithout loss of medicine by turning the dose knob in either direction until the symbol of a \ndroplet lines up with the dose indicator. \n \n\n \n \nStep 8: \n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.  \n\n\u2022 Tap with your finger on the cartridge holder to make any air bubbles in the cartridge rise to the \ntop of the cartridge. \n \n\n \n \nStep 9: \n\u2022 With the needle still pointing upwards (away from the face) press in the injection button all the \n\nway in until you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Check that a droplet of liquid appears at the tip of the needle.  \n\u2022 If no droplet(s) appear repeat Steps 7 to 9 (Priming) until a droplet appears. \n\u2022 If no droplet appears after 5 tries, remove the needle (See Step 13), attach a new needle  \n\n(See Steps 3 to 6), and repeat priming (See Steps 7 to 9).  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nDialing the dose \u2013 (Step 10) \n \nSee \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n \nStep 10: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until the prescribed dose lines up with the dose indicator in the \n\ndose display window. \n\u2022 The dose can be corrected either up or down without loss of medicine by turning the dose knob \n\nin either direction until the correct dose lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Do not press the injection button when dialing the dose to avoid loss of medicine. \n \n\n \n \nSplit-dosing: \n\u2022 You may need more than one pen to complete your prescribed dose. \n\u2022 If you are not able to dial your complete dose, this means there is not enough medicine left in \n\nthe pen. You will need to give a split-dose injection or throw away (dispose of) your current pen \nand use a new pen for your injection.  \n\n \nSee \u201cGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE\u201c at Page 22 to 231 for examples of how to calculate and \nrecord your split dose. \n \n \nInjecting the dose \u2013 (Step 11 to 12) \n \nImportant:  \n\u2022 Do not use the pen if the medicine contains particles or if the medicine is not clear.  \n\u2022 Read Step 11 and 12 at Page 14 to 151 before giving your injection. \n\u2022 This medicine should be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) in the  \n\nstomach-area (abdomen).  \n\u2022 Use a new injection site for each injection to lower the risk of skin reactions as redness and \n\nirritation. \n\u2022 Do not inject into an area that is sore (tender), bruised, red, hard, scarred or where you have \n\nstretch marks. \n \nStep 11 and 12: \n\u2022 Wipe the skin of your injection site with an alcohol swab to clean it. Do not touch this area \n\nagain before you give your injection. \n\u2022 Hold the pen so the dose display window is visible during injection.  \n\u2022 Pinch your skin and insert the needle straight into your skin as shown by your healthcare \n\nprovider. Do not touch the injection button yet. \n\u2022 After the needle is inserted, place your thumb on the injection button.  \n\u2022 Press the injection button all the way in and hold.  \n\u2022 Keep pressing the injection button in and when you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose \n\nindicator, wait for 5 seconds (slowly count to 5). This will make sure you get your full dose. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\u2022 After pressing in the injection button for 5 seconds, release the injection button. Then slowly \n\nremove the needle from the injection site by pulling it straight out of the skin. \n\u2022 If blood appears at the injection site, press a gauze pad or cotton ball lightly to the injection site. \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Do not tilt the pen during injection and removal from skin.  \n\u2022 Tilting the pen can cause the needle to bend or break off.  \n\u2022 If a broken needle remains stuck in the body or remains under the skin, get medical help right \n\naway. \n \n \nDisposal of Needle \u2013 (Step 13) \n \nStep 13: \n\u2022 Carefully replace the outer needle cap over the needle with a firm push (A). \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle in counter-clockwise direction to remove the needle from the pen (B+C).  \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the used needle carefully (D). \n\u2022 See \u201cDisposal\u201d at Page 181.    \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Always remove the needle after every use. The needles are for single-use only. \n\u2022 Do not store the pen with the needle attached. \n \n \nReplace pen cap \u2013 (Step 14) \n \nStep 14: \n\u2022 Firmly replace the pen cap on the pen for protection between injections. \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 The pen cap will not fit over a needle. \n\u2022 If you will give a split-dose injection, only throw away (dispose of) the pen when it is empty.  \n\u2022 If you will use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose instead of giving a split-dose \n\ninjection, throw away (dispose of) your pen when there is not enough medicine in the pen for a \nfull dose. \n\n\u2022 Keep the pen cap on the pen when it is not in use. \n \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nDisposal \n \nNeedles: \nPut your used needles in a puncture-resistant container, such as a sharps disposal container right away \nafter use. Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash. \n \nIf you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:  \n\u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic,  \n\u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,  \n\u2022 upright and stable during use,  \n\u2022 leak-resistant, and  \n\u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.  \n \nWhen your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community \nguidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local \nlaws about how you should throw away used needles. \n \nREKOVELLE pre-filled pens: \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) your used pens in accordance with local waste regulations. \n \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose using your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen  \nThe chart below shows examples of prescribed doses, how to dial the examples of prescribed doses, \nand what the dose display window looks like for the prescribed doses.   \n \nExamples of \nprescribed dose  \n(in micrograms) \n\nDose to dial on pen Dose display window for example of prescribed dose \n\n0.33 0 and 1 line  (Dial to 0 plus 1 click) \n \n\n0.66 (priming dose) 0 and 2 lines  (Dial to 0 plus 2 clicks) \n\n \n\n2.33 2 and 1 line  (Dial to 2 plus 1 click) \n \n\n11.00 11 (Dial to 11) \n \n\n12.33 12 and 1 line  (Dial to 12 plus 1 click) \n \n\n18.66 18 and 2 lines  (Dial to 18 plus 2 clicks) \n \n\n20.00 20 (Dial to 20) \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE \n \nIf you are not able to dial the full prescribed dose in your pen, this means that there is not enough \nmedicine left in the pen to give the full dose. You will need to give part of your prescribed dose using \nyour current pen and the remainder of the dose using a new pen (split-dose injection) or you may \nthrow away (dispose of) the pen you are using and use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose in \n1 injection. If you decide to give a split-dose injection, follow these instructions and write down how \nmuch medicine to give using the split-dose diary on Page 231. \n \n\u2022 Column A shows an example of a prescribed dose. Write down your prescribed dose in column \n\nA. \n\u2022 Column B shows an example of the dose that is left in the pen (this is equal to what you are able \n\nto dial). \n\u2022 Write down the dose that is left in your pen in column B. Give the injection using the rest of the \n\nmedicine that is left in your pen. \n\u2022 Prepare and prime a new pen (Step 1 to 9).  \n\u2022 Calculate and write down the remaining dose to inject in column C by subtracting the number in \n\ncolumn B from the number in column A. Use a calculator to check your math if needed. \n\u2022 See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211 if needed. \n\u2022 Doses should be rounded off to nearest increment, X.00, X.33 or X.66 micrograms. For \n\nexample, if the number in column C is 5.34, round your remaining dose to 5.33. If the number \nin column C is 9.67, round your remaining dose to 9.66.  \n\n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider if you have questions about how to calculate your split-dose. \n\u2022 Inject the remaining dose of medicine (the number in column C) using your new pen to \n\ncomplete your prescribed dose. \n \nSplit-dose diary \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \n \n1. Is the priming step necessary before each injection? \n\n\u2022 No. Priming must be performed only before giving the first injection with a new pen.  \n \n2. How do I know that the injection is complete? \n\n\u2022 The injection button is firmly pushed in all the way until it stops. \n\u2022 The number \u20180\u2019 is lined up with the dose indicator. \n\u2022 You have slowly counted to 5 while you are still holding the injection button in and the \n\nneedle is still in your skin. \n \n3. Why do I have to count to 5 while holding the injection button? \n\n\u2022 Holding the injection button for 5 seconds allows for the full dose to be injected and \nabsorbed under your skin. \n\n \n4. What if the dose knob cannot be turned to the required dose? \n\n\u2022 The cartridge in the pen may not have enough medicine left to deliver the prescribed \ndose. \n\n\u2022 The pen does not allow you to dial a larger dose than the dose that is left in the cartridge. \n\u2022 You can inject the medicine left in the pen and complete the prescribed dose with a new \n\npen (split-dose) or use a new pen to give the full prescribed dose. \n \n \nWarnings \n \n\u2022 Do not use a pen if it has been dropped or hit against hard surfaces.  \n\u2022 If the injection button is not easy to push in, do not use force. Change the needle. If the injection \n\nbutton still is not easy to push in after changing the needle, use a new pen.  \n\u2022 Do not try to repair a damaged pen. If a pen is damaged, contact your healthcare provider or \n\nlocal representative of the marketing authorisation holder (please refer to patient information \nleaflet for contact details). \n\n \n \nAdditional information \n \nNeedles \nNeedles are supplied with your pen.

What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store REKOVELLE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What REKOVELLE is and what it is used for \n \nREKOVELLE contains follitropin delta, a follicle stimulating hormone which belongs to the family of \nhormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. \n \nREKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted \nreproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection \n(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs (\u2018follicles\u2019), from \nwhich eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use REKOVELLE \n \nBefore starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible \ncauses of your fertility problems. \n \nDo not use REKOVELLE if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus \n\u2022 you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian \n\ndisease) \n\u2022 you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause \n\u2022 you have had an early menopause \n\u2022 you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible \n\u2022 you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. \n \n\n\n\n100 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nGonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your \nfollicles develop too much and become large cysts. \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n\u2022 have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling \n\u2022 have nausea  \n\u2022 are vomiting  \n\u2022 get diarrhoea \n\u2022 gain weight  \n\u2022 have difficulty in breathing \nYour doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). \nIf the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation \nsyndrome is less likely. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nClots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility \ntreatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone \nin your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor \nif you think this applies to you. \n \nTwisting of ovaries \nThere have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive \ntechnology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and birth defects \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple \npregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the \nquality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you \nand your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility \ntreatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your \npartner\u2019s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy loss \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a \nmiscarriage than if you conceive naturally. \n \nPregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) \nWhen undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy \noutside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal \ndisease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n \nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours \nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had \nundergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of \nthese tumours in infertile women. \n \nOther medical conditions \nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:  \n\u2022 you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you \n\u2022 you have kidney or liver disease \n \nChildren and adolescents (under 18 years of age) \n \nThis medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nOther medicines and REKOVELLE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nREKOVELLE contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use REKOVELLE \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and at the dose your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level \nof anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with \ngonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample \n(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight \nwill also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. \n \nThe REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or \ndecrease your daily dose. Your doctor will monitor the effect of REKOVELLE treatment, and \ntreatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. In general, you will be given \na single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of \n250 micrograms or 5,000 IU for final development of the follicles. \n \nIf your body\u00b4s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment with REKOVELLE. For the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you \neither a higher or a lower daily dose of REKOVELLE than before. \n \nHow are injections given \nThe instructions for using the pre-filled  pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the pre-filled pen \nif the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. \n \nThe first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. Your \ndoctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after \nreceiving adequate training. \n \nThis medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. \nThe pre-filled pen may be used for several injections. \n \nIf you use more REKOVELLE than you should \n \nThe effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \nmay possibly occur, which is described in section 4. \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nIf you forget to use REKOVELLE \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor as soon as you \nnotice that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \n \nHormones used in the treatment of infertility such as this medicine may cause a high level of activity \nin the ovaries (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). Symptoms may include pain, discomfort or \nswelling of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight gain or difficulty breathing. If you have \nany of these symptoms you should contact a doctor immediately. \n \nThe risk of having a side effect is described by the following categories: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see above) \n\u2022 Pelvic pain and discomfort, including of ovarian origin \n\u2022 Tiredness (fatigue) \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\u2022 Mood swings \n\u2022 Sleepiness/drowsiness \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\u2022 Constipation \n\u2022 Discomfort of the abdomen \n\u2022 Vaginal bleeding \n\u2022 Breast complaints (include breast pain, breast tenderness) \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

There may be new information. Follow the instructions carefully even if you have used a \nsimilar injection pen before. Using the pen incorrectly could result in receiving an incorrect dose of \nmedicine.  \nCall your healthcare provider (doctor, nurse or pharmacist) if you have any questions about how to \ngive your REKOVELLE injection.   \n \nThe REKOVELLE pre-filled pen is a disposable, dial-a-dose pen that can be used to give more than \n1 dose of REKOVELLE. The pen is available in 3 different strengths: \n\u2022 12 micrograms/0.36 mL \n\u2022 36 micrograms/1.08 mL \n\u2022 72 micrograms/2.16 mL \n \n \nREKOVELLE pre-filled pen and its parts \n \n\n \n \n \nInstructions for use \u2013 REKOVELLE (follitropin delta) pre-filled pen \n \nImportant information \n\u2022 The REKOVELLE pre-filled pen and the needles are for use by only one person and should not \n\nbe shared with others.  \n\u2022 Use the pen only for the medical condition it is prescribed for and as directed by your healthcare \n\nprovider.  \n\u2022 If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose scale on the pen, do not use this \n\npen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen.  \n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider or local representative of the marketing authorisation holder \n\n(please refer to pa-tient information leaflet for contact details) before giving your REKOVELLE \ninjection if you have questions.  \n\n  \nInformation about your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen \nThe pen can be dialed to give doses from 0.33 micrograms to 20 micrograms of REKOVELLE in \nmarked increments of 0.33 micrograms. See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n\u2022 The dose scale of the pen is numbered from 0 to 20 micrograms.  \n\u2022 Each number is separated by two lines, each line is equal to one increment of 0.33 micrograms.  \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\u2022 When turning the dial to your dose, you will hear a click sound and feel resistance on the dial \nfor each increment to help you dial the correct dose. \n\n  \nCleaning \n\u2022 If needed, the outside of your pen may be cleaned with a cloth moistened with water.  \n\u2022 Do not put the pen in water or any other liquid. \n \nStorage  \n\u2022 Always store the pen with the pen cap on and without a needle attached. \n\u2022 Do not use the pen after the month of expiration (EXP) printed on the pen label.  \n\u2022 Do not store the pen in extreme temperatures, direct sunlight or very cold conditions, such as in \n\na car or freezer. \n\u2022 Store the pen out of the reach of children and anyone who has not been trained to use the pen. \n  \n\nBefore use: \n\u2022 Store the pen in a refrigerator at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. Do not freeze. \n\u2022 If stored outside the refrigerator (at 2 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C), the pen will last up to 3 months \n\nincluding the in-use period. Throw away (dispose of) the pen if it has not been used after \n3 months. \n\n \nAfter first use (in-use period): \n\u2022 The pen may be stored for up to 28 days at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C.  \n\n \nSupplies you will need to give your REKOVELLE injection \n \n\n \n \nBefore use \u2013 (Step 1) \nStep 1:  \n\u2022 Wash your hands. \n\u2022 Check the pen to see that it is not damaged. Do not use the pen if it is damaged. \n\u2022 Check the pen (cartridge) to see that the medicine is clear and does not contain particles. Do not \n\nuse a pen with particles or unclear medicine in the cartridge.  \n\u2022 Make sure you have the correct pen with correct strength. \n\u2022 Check the expiration on the pen label. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nAttaching needle \u2013 (Step 2 to 6) \n \nImportant: \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. \n\u2022 Only use the single-use click-on needles supplied with the pen. \n \nStep 2: \n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 3: \n\u2022 Pull off the protective foil from the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 4: \n\u2022 Click on the needle. \n\u2022 You will hear or feel a click when the needle is safely on. \n\u2022 You may also screw on the needle. When you feel a light resistance it is safely on. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 5: \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap. \n\u2022 Do not throw the outer needle cap away. You will need it to throw away (dispose of) the needle \n\nafter injecting the medicine. \n \n\n \n \nStep 6: \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\nPriming \u2013 (Step 7 to 9) \n \n\u2022 Before using the pen for the first time, you need to remove air bubbles from the cartridge \n\n(Priming) to receive the correct dose of medicine.  \n\u2022 Only prime your pen the first time you use it.  \n\u2022 Perform Step 7 to 9 even if you do not see air bubbles. \n\u2022 If the pen has already been used proceed directly to Step 10. \n \nStep 7: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until a symbol of a droplet lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 If you dial the incorrect priming dose, the priming dose can be corrected either up or down \n\nwithout loss of medicine by turning the dose knob in either direction until the symbol of a \ndroplet lines up with the dose indicator. \n \n\n \n \nStep 8: \n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.  \n\n\u2022 Tap with your finger on the cartridge holder to make any air bubbles in the cartridge rise to the \ntop of the cartridge. \n \n\n \n \nStep 9: \n\u2022 With the needle still pointing upwards (away from the face) press in the injection button all the \n\nway in until you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Check that a droplet of liquid appears at the tip of the needle.  \n\u2022 If no droplet(s) appear repeat Steps 7 to 9 (Priming) until a droplet appears. \n\u2022 If no droplet appears after 5 tries, remove the needle (See Step 13), attach a new needle  \n\n(See Steps 3 to 6), and repeat priming (See Steps 7 to 9).  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n110 \n\nDialing the dose \u2013 (Step 10) \n \nSee \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211.  \n \nStep 10: \n\u2022 Turn the dose knob clockwise until the prescribed dose lines up with the dose indicator in the \n\ndose display window. \n\u2022 The dose can be corrected either up or down without loss of medicine by turning the dose knob \n\nin either direction until the correct dose lines up with the dose indicator.  \n\u2022 Do not press the injection button when dialing the dose to avoid loss of medicine. \n \n\n \n \nSplit-dosing: \n\u2022 You may need more than one pen to complete your prescribed dose. \n\u2022 If you are not able to dial your complete dose, this means there is not enough medicine left in \n\nthe pen. You will need to give a split-dose injection or throw away (dispose of) your current pen \nand use a new pen for your injection.  \n\n \nSee \u201cGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE\u201c at Page 22 to 231 for examples of how to calculate and \nrecord your split dose. \n \n \nInjecting the dose \u2013 (Step 11 to 12) \n \nImportant:  \n\u2022 Do not use the pen if the medicine contains particles or if the medicine is not clear.  \n\u2022 Read Step 11 and 12 at Page 14 to 151 before giving your injection. \n\u2022 This medicine should be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) in the  \n\nstomach-area (abdomen).  \n\u2022 Use a new injection site for each injection to lower the risk of skin reactions as redness and \n\nirritation. \n\u2022 Do not inject into an area that is sore (tender), bruised, red, hard, scarred or where you have \n\nstretch marks. \n \nStep 11 and 12: \n\u2022 Wipe the skin of your injection site with an alcohol swab to clean it. Do not touch this area \n\nagain before you give your injection. \n\u2022 Hold the pen so the dose display window is visible during injection.  \n\u2022 Pinch your skin and insert the needle straight into your skin as shown by your healthcare \n\nprovider. Do not touch the injection button yet. \n\u2022 After the needle is inserted, place your thumb on the injection button.  \n\u2022 Press the injection button all the way in and hold.  \n\u2022 Keep pressing the injection button in and when you see the number \u20180\u2019 lined up with the dose \n\nindicator, wait for 5 seconds (slowly count to 5). This will make sure you get your full dose. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\u2022 After pressing in the injection button for 5 seconds, release the injection button. Then slowly \n\nremove the needle from the injection site by pulling it straight out of the skin. \n\u2022 If blood appears at the injection site, press a gauze pad or cotton ball lightly to the injection site. \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Do not tilt the pen during injection and removal from skin.  \n\u2022 Tilting the pen can cause the needle to bend or break off.  \n\u2022 If a broken needle remains stuck in the body or remains under the skin, get medical help right \n\naway. \n \n \nDisposal of Needle \u2013 (Step 13) \n \nStep 13: \n\u2022 Carefully replace the outer needle cap over the needle with a firm push (A). \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle in counter-clockwise direction to remove the needle from the pen (B+C).  \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the used needle carefully (D). \n\u2022 See \u201cDisposal\u201d at Page 181.    \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 Always remove the needle after every use. The needles are for single-use only. \n\u2022 Do not store the pen with the needle attached. \n \n \nReplace pen cap \u2013 (Step 14) \n \nStep 14: \n\u2022 Firmly replace the pen cap on the pen for protection between injections. \n \n\n \n \nNote: \n\u2022 The pen cap will not fit over a needle. \n\u2022 If you will give a split-dose injection, only throw away (dispose of) the pen when it is empty.  \n\u2022 If you will use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose instead of giving a split-dose \n\ninjection, throw away (dispose of) your pen when there is not enough medicine in the pen for a \nfull dose. \n\n\u2022 Keep the pen cap on the pen when it is not in use. \n \n \n\n\n\n112 \n\nDisposal \n \nNeedles: \nPut your used needles in a puncture-resistant container, such as a sharps disposal container right away \nafter use. Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash. \n \nIf you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:  \n\u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic,  \n\u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,  \n\u2022 upright and stable during use,  \n\u2022 leak-resistant, and  \n\u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.  \n \nWhen your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community \nguidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local \nlaws about how you should throw away used needles. \n \nREKOVELLE pre-filled pens: \n\u2022 Throw away (dispose of) your used pens in accordance with local waste regulations. \n \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose \n \nExamples of how to dial a dose using your REKOVELLE pre-filled pen  \nThe chart below shows examples of prescribed doses, how to dial the examples of prescribed doses, \nand what the dose display window looks like for the prescribed doses.   \n \nExamples of \nprescribed dose  \n(in micrograms) \n\nDose to dial on pen Dose display window for example of prescribed dose \n\n0.33 0 and 1 line  (Dial to 0 plus 1 click) \n \n\n0.66 (priming dose) 0 and 2 lines  (Dial to 0 plus 2 clicks) \n\n \n\n2.33 2 and 1 line  (Dial to 2 plus 1 click) \n \n\n11.00 11 (Dial to 11) \n \n\n12.33 12 and 1 line  (Dial to 12 plus 1 click) \n \n\n18.66 18 and 2 lines  (Dial to 18 plus 2 clicks) \n \n\n20.00 20 (Dial to 20) \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\nGiving a split-dose of REKOVELLE \n \nIf you are not able to dial the full prescribed dose in your pen, this means that there is not enough \nmedicine left in the pen to give the full dose. You will need to give part of your prescribed dose using \nyour current pen and the remainder of the dose using a new pen (split-dose injection) or you may \nthrow away (dispose of) the pen you are using and use a new pen to give your full prescribed dose in \n1 injection. If you decide to give a split-dose injection, follow these instructions and write down how \nmuch medicine to give using the split-dose diary on Page 231. \n \n\u2022 Column A shows an example of a prescribed dose. Write down your prescribed dose in column \n\nA. \n\u2022 Column B shows an example of the dose that is left in the pen (this is equal to what you are able \n\nto dial). \n\u2022 Write down the dose that is left in your pen in column B. Give the injection using the rest of the \n\nmedicine that is left in your pen. \n\u2022 Prepare and prime a new pen (Step 1 to 9).  \n\u2022 Calculate and write down the remaining dose to inject in column C by subtracting the number in \n\ncolumn B from the number in column A. Use a calculator to check your math if needed. \n\u2022 See \u201cExamples of how to dial a dose\u201d at Page 20 to 211 if needed. \n\u2022 Doses should be rounded off to nearest increment, X.00, X.33 or X.66 micrograms. For \n\nexample, if the number in column C is 5.34, round your remaining dose to 5.33. If the number \nin column C is 9.67, round your remaining dose to 9.66.  \n\n\u2022 Call your healthcare provider if you have questions about how to calculate your split-dose. \n\u2022 Inject the remaining dose of medicine (the number in column C) using your new pen to \n\ncomplete your prescribed dose. \n \nSplit-dose diary \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \n \n1. Is the priming step necessary before each injection? \n\n\u2022 No. Priming must be performed only before giving the first injection with a new pen.  \n \n2. How do I know that the injection is complete? \n\n\u2022 The injection button is firmly pushed in all the way until it stops. \n\u2022 The number \u20180\u2019 is lined up with the dose indicator. \n\u2022 You have slowly counted to 5 while you are still holding the injection button in and the \n\nneedle is still in your skin. \n \n3. Why do I have to count to 5 while holding the injection button? \n\n\u2022 Holding the injection button for 5 seconds allows for the full dose to be injected and \nabsorbed under your skin. \n\n \n4. What if the dose knob cannot be turned to the required dose? \n\n\u2022 The cartridge in the pen may not have enough medicine left to deliver the prescribed \ndose. \n\n\u2022 The pen does not allow you to dial a larger dose than the dose that is left in the cartridge. \n\u2022 You can inject the medicine left in the pen and complete the prescribed dose with a new \n\npen (split-dose) or use a new pen to give the full prescribed dose. \n \n \nWarnings \n \n\u2022 Do not use a pen if it has been dropped or hit against hard surfaces.  \n\u2022 If the injection button is not easy to push in, do not use force. Change the needle. If the injection \n\nbutton still is not easy to push in after changing the needle, use a new pen.  \n\u2022 Do not try to repair a damaged pen. If a pen is damaged, contact your healthcare provider or \n\nlocal representative of the marketing authorisation holder (please refer to patient information \nleaflet for contact details). \n\n \n \nAdditional information \n \nNeedles \nNeedles are supplied with your pen.

"Section_2": {"Title": "2. what you need to know before you use rekovelle", "Section_Content": "before starting treatment with this medicine, a doctor should check you and your partner for possible causes of your fertility problems. do not use rekovelle if: you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian disease) you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause you have had an early menopause you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. warnings and precautions ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome gonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. this is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. talk to your doctor if you: have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling have nausea are vomiting get diarrhoea gain weight have difficulty in breathing your doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is less likely. blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) clots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. infertility treatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone in your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). tell your doctor if you think this applies to you. twisting of ovaries there have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive technology treatment. twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. multiple pregnancy and birth defects when undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple pregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the quality of the embryos, and your age. multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility treatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your partner's sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. pregnancy loss when undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than if you conceive naturally. pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) when undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. if you have a history of tubal disease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. ovarian and other reproductive system tumours there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had undergone infertility treatment. it is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of these tumours in infertile women. other medical conditions before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if: you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you you have kidney or liver disease children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) this medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. other medicines and rekovelle tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. pregnancy and breast-feeding do not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines this medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. rekovelle

your doctor has told you. check with your doctor if you are not sure. the rekovelle dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level of anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (amh, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with gonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. therefore the amh result from a blood sample (taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. your body weight will also be measured before you start treatment. the rekovelle dose is stated in micrograms. the rekovelle dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or decrease your daily dose. your doctor will monitor the effect of rekovelle treatment, and treatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. in general, you will be given a single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) at a dose of 250 micrograms or 5,000 iu for final development of the follicles. if your body\u00b4s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop treatment with rekovelle. for the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you either a higher or a lower daily dose of rekovelle than before. how are injections given rekovelle is developed for use in the rekovelle injection pen. the instructions for using the injection pen supplied with the pen including loading the cartridge must be followed carefully. do not use the cartridge if the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. the first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. your doctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after receiving adequate training. this medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. the cartridge may be used for several injections. if you use more rekovelle than you should the effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may possibly occur, which is described in section 4. if you forget to use rekovelle do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. please contact your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this
