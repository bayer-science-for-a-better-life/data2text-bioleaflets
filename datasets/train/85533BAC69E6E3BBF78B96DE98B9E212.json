NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nLITAK 2 mg/ml solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml of solution contains 2 mg of cladribine (2-CdA). Each vial contains 10 mg of cladribine in \n\n5 ml of solution.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nLITAK is indicated for the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy with LITAK should be initiated by a qualified physician with experience in cancer \n\nchemotherapy. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended posology for hairy cell leukaemia is a single course of LITAK given by \n\nsubcutaneous bolus injection at a daily dose of 0.14 mg/kg body weight for 5 consecutive days. \n\n \n\nDeviations from the posology indicated above are not advised.  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nExperience with patients older than 65 years is limited. Elderly patients should be treated by individual \n\nassessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts and of the renal and hepatic function. The risk \n\nrequires assessment on a case-by-case basis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no data on the use of LITAK in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. LITAK is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n\u2264 50 ml/min) or with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 6) (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nLITAK is contraindicated in patients less than 18 years of age (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nLITAK is supplied as a ready-to-use solution for injection. The recommended dose is directly \n\nwithdrawn by a syringe and injected as a subcutaneous bolus injection without dilution. LITAK should \n\nbe inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. LITAK should \n\nwarm up to room temperature prior to administration. \n\n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nSelf-administration by the patient \n\nLITAK can be self-administered by the patient. Patients should be instructed and trained \n\nappropriately. Detailed instructions are contained in the Package Leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and lactation. \n\n \n\nPatients less than 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nModerate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2264 50 ml/min) or moderate to severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh score > 6) (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of other myelosuppressive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCladribine is an antineoplastic and immunosuppressive substance that can induce considerable toxic \n\nadverse reactions, such as myelo- and immunosuppression, long-lasting lymphocytopenia, and \n\nopportunistic infections. Patients undergoing treatment with cladribine should be closely monitored for \n\nsigns of haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities. \n\n \n\nParticular caution is advised and risks/benefits should be carefully evaluated if administration of \n\ncladribine is considered in patients with increased infection risk, manifested bone marrow failure or \n\ninfiltration, myelosuppressive pre-treatments, as well as in patients with suspected or manifested renal \n\nand hepatic insufficiency. Patients with active infection should be treated for the underlying condition \n\nprior to receiving therapy with cladribine. Although anti-infective prophylaxis is not generally \n\nrecommended, it may be beneficial for patients immunocompromised prior to therapy with cladribine or \n\nfor patients with a pre-existing agranulocytosis.  \n\n \n\nIf severe toxicity occurs, the physician should consider delaying or discontinuing the therapy with the \n\nmedicinal product until serious complications resolve. In case of infections, antibiotic treatment should \n\nbe initiated as required. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that patients receiving cladribine should receive irradiated cellular blood \n\ncomponents/products to prevent transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease (Ta-GVHD). \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nCases of PML, including fatal cases, have been reported with cladribine. PML was reported 6 months \n\nto several years after treatment with cladribine. An association with prolonged lymphopenia has been \n\nreported in several of these cases. Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in \n\npatients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. \n\n \n\nSuggested evaluation for PML includes neurology consultation, magnetic resonance imaging of the \n\nbrain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or \n\na brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-\n\nup and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established. Patients with \n\nsuspected PML should not receive further treatment with cladribine. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nSecondary malignancies \n\nLike other nucleoside analogues, treatment with cladribine is associated with myelosuppression and \n\nprofound and prolonged immunosuppression. Treatment with these agents is associated with the \n\noccurrence of second malignancies. Secondary malignancies are expected to occur in patients with \n\nhairy cell leukaemia. Their frequency varies widely, ranging from 2% to 21%. The peak risk is at 2 \n\nyears after diagnosis with a median between 40 and 66 months. The cumulative frequencies of second \n\nmalignancy are 5%, 10-12% and 13-14% following 5, 10 and 15 years respectively after diagnosis of \n\nhairy cell leukaemia. Following cladribine, the incidence of second malignancies ranges from 0% to \n\n9.5% after a median observation period of 2.8 to 8.5 years. The frequency of second malignancy \n\nfollowing treatment with LITAK was 3.4% in all 232 hairy cell leukaemia patients treated, during a \n\n10-year period. The highest incidence of second malignancy with LITAK was 6.5% after a median \n\nfollow-up of 8.4 years. Therefore, patients treated with cladribine should be regularly monitored. \n\n \n\nHaematologic toxicity \n\nDuring the first month following treatment, myelosuppression is most notable and red blood cell or \n\nplatelet transfusions may be required. Patients with symptoms of bone marrow depression should be \n\ntreated with caution, since further suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated. \n\nTherapeutic risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated in patients with active or suspected \n\ninfections. The risk of severe myelotoxicity and long-lasting immunosuppression is increased in \n\npatients with a disease-related bone marrow infiltration or a previous myelosuppressive treatment. \n\nDose reduction and regular monitoring of the patient is required in such cases. Pancytopenia is \n\nnormally reversible and the intensity of bone marrow aplasia is dose-dependent. An increased \n\nincidence of opportunistic infections is expected during, and for 6 months following, therapy with \n\ncladribine. Careful and regular monitoring of peripheral blood counts is essential during, and for 2 to 4 \n\nmonths following, treatment with cladribine to detect potential adverse reactions and consequent \n\ncomplications (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections, haemolysis or bleedings), and to \n\nsurvey haematologic recovery. Fever of unknown origin frequently occurs in patients treated for hairy \n\ncell leukaemia and is manifested predominantly during the first 4 weeks of therapy. The origin of \n\nfebrile events should be investigated by appropriate laboratory and radiologic tests. Less than a third \n\nof febrile events are associated with a documented infection. In case of fever related to infections or \n\nagranulocytosis, an antibiotic treatment is indicated. \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no data on the use of LITAK in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Clinical experience \n\nis very limited and safety of LITAK in these patients is not well established (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  \n\nCareful treatment is required in patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic impairment. For all \n\npatients treated with LITAK, periodic assessment of renal and hepatic function is advised as clinically \n\nindicated. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nElderly patients should be treated by individual assessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts \n\nand of the renal and hepatic function. The risk requires assessment on a case-by-case basis (see section \n\n4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of tumour lysis syndrome \n\nIn patients with a high tumour burden, prophylactic allopurinol therapy to control serum levels of uric \n\nacid, together with adequate or increased hydration, should be commenced 24 hours before the start of \n\nchemotherapy. A daily oral dose of 100 mg of allopurinol is recommended for a period of 2 weeks. In \n\ncase of an accumulation of the serum uric acid above the normal range, the dose of allopurinol may be \n\nincreased to 300 mg/day.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nMen being treated with cladribine should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after \n\ntreatment and to seek advice of cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility \n\nof infertility due to therapy with cladribine (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nDue to a potential increase of haematological toxicity and bone marrow suppression, cladribine must \n\nnot be used concomitantly with other myelosuppressive medicinal products. An influence of cladribine \n\non the activity of other antineoplastic agents has not been observed in vitro (e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine, \n\ncytarabine, cyclophosphamide) and in vivo. However, an in vitro study revealed cross-resistance \n\nbetween cladribine and nitrogen mustard (chlormethine); for cytarabine, one author has described an \n\nin vivo cross-reaction without loss of activity.  \n\n \n\nDue to the similar intracellular metabolism, cross-resistance with other nucleoside analogues, such as \n\nfludarabine or 2\u2019-deoxycoformycin may occur. Therefore, simultaneous administration of nucleoside \n\nanalogues with cladribine is not advisable. \n\n \n\nCorticosteroids have been shown to enhance the risk for severe infections when used in combination \n\nwith cladribine and should not be given concomitantly with cladribine.  \n\n \n\nSince interactions with medicinal products undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, such as antiviral \n\nagents, or with inhibitors of adenosine uptake may be expected, their concomitant use with cladribine \n\nis not recommended. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nCladribine causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Animal studies and in vitro \n\nstudies with human cell lines demonstrated the teratogenicity and mutagenicity of cladribine. Cladribine \n\nis contraindicated in pregnancy.  \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with cladribine and \n\nfor 6 months after the last cladribine dose. In case of pregnancy during therapy with cladribine, the \n\nwoman should be informed about the potential hazard to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether cladribine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \n\nadverse reactions in nursing infants, lactation is contraindicated during treatment with cladribine and \n\nfor 6 months after the last cladribine dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThe effects of cladribine on fertility have not been studied in animals. However, a toxicity study \n\nconducted with cynomolgus monkeys has shown that cladribine suppresses maturation of rapidly \n\ngenerating cells, including testicular cells. The effect on human fertility is unknown. Antineoplastic \n\nagents, such as cladribine, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected \n\nto have adverse effects on human gametogenesis (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMen being treated with cladribine should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after \n\ntreatment and to seek advice of cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility \n\nof infertility due to therapy with cladribine (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLITAK has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In case certain adverse reactions \n\nwith a potential impact on performance occur (e.g. dizziness, very common, or drowsiness, which may \n\noccur due to anaemia, which is very common), patients should be advised not to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nVery common adverse reactions observed during the three most relevant clinical trials with cladribine \n\nin 279 patients treated for various indications and in 62 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) were \n\nmyelosuppression, especially severe neutropenia (41% (113/279), HCL 98% (61/62)), severe \n\nthrombocytopenia (21% (58/279), HCL 50% (31/62)) and severe anaemia (14% (21/150), HCL 55% \n\n(34/62)), as well as severe immunosuppression/lymphopenia (63% (176/279), HCL 95% (59/62)), \n\ninfections (39% (110/279), HCL 58% (36/62)) and fever (up to 64%). \n\n \n\nCulture-negative fever following treatment with cladribine occurs in 10-40% of patients with hairy \n\ncell leukaemia and is rarely observed in patients with other neoplastic disorders. Skin rashes (2-31%) \n\nare mainly described in patients with other concomitantly administered medicinal products known to \n\ncause rash (antibiotics and/or allopurinol). Gastrointestinal adverse reactions like nausea (5-28%), \n\nvomiting (1-13%), and diarrhoea (3-12%) as well as fatigue (2-48%), headache (1-23%), and \n\ndecreased appetite (1-22%) have been reported during treatment with cladribine. Cladribine is unlikely \n\nto cause alopecia; mild and transient alopecia for a few days was observed in 4/523 patients during the \n\ntreatment, but could not clearly be associated with cladribine.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nAdverse reactions that have been reported are listed in the table below by frequency category and \n\nsystem organ class. The frequencies are defined as follows: Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 \n\nto <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). For severity, please see text below the table. \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nInfections and infestations Very common: infections * (e.g. pneumonia *, septicaemia *) \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \n\nand unspecified (incl cysts and \n\npolyps) \n\nCommon: second malignancies * \n\nRare: tumour lysis syndrome * \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: pancytopenia/myelosuppression *, neutropenia, \n\nthrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia \n\nUncommon: haemolytic anaemia * \n\nRare: hypereosinophilia \n\nVery rare: amyloidosis \n\nImmune system disorders Very common: immunosuppression * \n\nRare: graft-versus-host disease * \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: decreased appetite \n\nUncommon: cachexia \n\nNervous system disorders Very common: headache, dizziness \n\nCommon: insomnia, anxiety \n\nUncommon: somnolence, paraesthesia, lethargy, polyneuropathy, \n\nconfusion, ataxia \n\nRare: apoplexy, neurological disturbances in speech and \n\nswallowing \n\nVery rare: depression, epileptic seizure \n\nEye disorders Uncommon: conjunctivitis \n\nVery rare: blepharitis  \n\nCardiac disorders Common: tachycardia, heart murmur, hypotension, epistaxis, \n\nmyocardial ischemia * \n\nRare: Cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiac decompensation \n\nVascular disorders Very common: purpura \n\nCommon: petechiae, haemorrhages * \n\nUncommon: phlebitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery common: abnormal breath sounds, abnormal chest sounds, \n\ncough \n\nCommon: shortness of breath, pulmonary interstitial infiltrates \n\nmostly due to infectious aetiology, mucositis \n\nUncommon: pharyngitis \n\nVery rare: lung embolism \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea \n\nCommon: gastrointestinal pain, flatulence \n\nRare: ileus \n\nHepato-biliary disorders Common: reversible, mostly mild increases in bilirubin and \n\ntransaminases \n\nRare: hepatic failure \n\nVery rare: cholecystitis  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: rash, localised exanthema, diaphoresis \n\nCommon: pruritus, skin pain, erythema, urticaria \n\nRare: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Lyell syndrome \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders  \n\nCommon: myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, bone pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Rare: renal failure \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common: injection site reactions, fever, fatigue, chills, \n\nasthenia \n\nCommon: oedema, malaise, pain \n\n* see descriptive section below. \n\n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\nNon-haematological adverse reactions \n\nNon-haematological adverse reactions are generally mild to moderate in severity. Treatment of nausea \n\nwith antiemetics is usually not necessary. Adverse reactions related to skin and subcutaneous tissue \n\nare mostly mild or moderate and transient, usually resolving within a cycle interval of 30 days. \n\n \n\nBlood counts \n\nSince patients with an active hairy cell leukaemia mostly present with low blood counts, especially \n\nlow neutrophil counts, more than 90% of the cases have transient severe neutropenias (< 1.0 x 109/l). \n\nThe use of haematopoietic growth factors neither improves the recovery of neutrophil counts nor \n\ndecreases the incidence of fever. Severe thrombocytopenias (< 50 x 109/l) are observed in about 20% \n\nto 30% of all patients. Lymphocytopenia lasting for several months and immunosuppression with an \n\nincreased risk of infections are expected. The recovery of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer \n\ncells occurs within 3 to 12 months. A complete recovery of T-helper cells and B-lymphocytes is \n\ndelayed for up to 2 years. Cladribine induces a severe and prolonged reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ \n\nT-lymphocytes. At present there exists no experience on possible long-term consequences of this \n\nimmunosuppression. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nSevere long-term lymphocytopenias have been reported rarely which, however, could not be \n\nassociated with late infectious complications. Very common severe complications, in some cases with \n\nfatal outcome, are opportunistic infections (e.g. Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, listeria, \n\ncandida, herpes viruses, cytomegalovirus and atypical mycobacteria). Forty percent of the patients \n\nwho were treated with LITAK at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg body weight per cycle suffered from infections. \n\nThese were on average more severe than the infections manifested in 27% of all patients receiving a \n\nreduced dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight per cycle. Forty-three percent of patients with hairy cell \n\nleukaemia experienced infectious complications at standard dose regimen. One third of these \n\ninfections have to be considered as severe (e.g. septicaemia, pneumonia). At least 10 cases with acute \n\nautoimmune haemolytic anaemia have been reported. All patients were successfully treated with \n\ncorticosteroids. \n\n \n\nRare serious adverse reactions \n\nSerious adverse reactions like ileus, severe hepatic failure, renal failure, cardiac failure, atrial \n\nfibrillation, cardiac decompensation, apoplexy, neurological disturbances in speech and swallowing, \n\ntumour lysis syndrome with acute renal failure, transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome/Lyell syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis), haemolytic anaemia, \n\nhypereosinophilia (with erythematous skin rash, pruritus, and facial oedema) are rare. \n\n \n\nFatal outcome \n\nThe majority of deaths related to the medicinal product are due to infectious complications. Further \n\nrare cases with fatal outcome, reported in association with LITAK chemotherapy, were second \n\nmalignancy, cerebro- and cardiovascular infarctions, graft-versus-host disease caused by multiple \n\ntransfusions of non-irradiated blood, as well as tumour lysis syndrome with hyperuricaemia, metabolic \n\nacidosis, and acute renal failure. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 9 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nFrequently observed symptoms of overdose are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, severe bone marrow \n\ndepression (including anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis), acute renal \n\ninsufficiency, as well as irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 \n\nsyndrome, and Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome. Acute, irreversible neuro- and nephrotoxicity have been \n\ndescribed in individual patients treated at a dose which was \u2265 4 times higher than the recommended \n\nregimen for hairy cell leukaemia. \n\n \n\nNo specific antidote exists. Immediate discontinuation of therapy, careful observation, and initiation of \n\nappropriate supportive measures (blood transfusions, dialysis, haemofiltration, anti-infectious therapy, \n\netc.) are the indicated treatment of overdose of cladribine. Patients who have received an overdose of \n\ncladribine should be monitored haematologically for at least four weeks. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Purine analogues, ATC code: L01BB04 \n\n \n\nCladribine is a purine nucleoside analogue acting as an antimetabolite. The single substitution of \n\nhydrogen for chlorine at position 2 distinguishes cladribine from its natural counterpart \n\n2'-deoxyadenosine and renders the molecule resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nCladribine is a prodrug which is taken up rapidly in cells after parenteral administration, and is \n\nphosphorylated intracellularly to the active nucleotide 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate \n\n(CdATP) by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). An accumulation of active CdATP is observed \n\npredominantly in cells with a high dCK activity and a low deoxynucleotidase activity, particularly in \n\nlymphocytes and in other haematopoietic cells. The cytotoxicity of cladribine is dose-dependent. \n\nNon-haematologic tissues seem to be unaffected, explaining the low incidence of non-haematopoietic \n\ntoxicity of cladribine \n\n \n\nUnlike other nucleoside analogues, cladribine is toxic in rapidly proliferating cells as well as in resting \n\ncells. No cytotoxic effect of cladribine could be observed in cell lines of solid tumours. The \n\nmechanism of action of cladribine is attributed to the incorporation of CdATP into DNA strands: the \n\nsynthesis of new DNA in dividing cells is blocked and the DNA repair mechanism is inhibited, \n\nresulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks and a decrease of NAD (nicotinamide adenine \n\ndinucleotide) and ATP concentration, even in resting cells. Furthermore, CdATP inhibits \n\nribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides into \n\ndeoxyribonucleotides. Cell death occurs from energy depletion and apoptosis. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIn the clinical trial using LITAK subcutaneously, 63 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (33 newly \n\ndiagnosed patients and 30 patients with relapsed or progressive disease) were treated. The overall \n\nresponse rate was 97% with long-lasting remission, with 73% of patients staying in complete remission \n\nafter four years follow-up time. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nCladribine shows complete bioavailability after parenteral administration; the mean area under the \n\nplasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is comparable after continuous or intermittent 2-hour \n\nintravenous infusion and after subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nDistribution \n\nAfter subcutaneous bolus injection of a 0.14 mg/kg cladribine dose, a Cmax of 91 ng/ml is reached on \n\naverage after 20 minutes only. In another study using a dose of 0.10 mg/kg body weight/day, the \n\nmaximum plasma concentration Cmax after continuous intravenous infusion was 5.1 ng/ml (tmax: 12 \n\nhours) compared to 51 ng/ml after subcutaneous bolus injection (tmax: 25 minutes). \n\n \n\nIntracellular concentration of cladribine exceeds its plasma concentration by 128 to 375 times. \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution of cladribine is 9.2 l/kg. Plasma protein binding of cladribine is 25% \n\non average, with a wide interindividual variation (5-50%). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThe prodrug cladribine is metabolised intracellularly, predominantly by deoxycytidine kinase, to \n\n2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate, that is further phosphorylated to the diphosphate by \n\nnucleoside monophosphate kinase and to the active metabolite \n\n2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (CdATP) by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nPharmacokinetic studies in humans showed that the plasma concentration curve of cladribine fits a 2- \n\nor 3-compartment model with \uf061- and \u03b2-half-lives of on average 35 minutes and 6.7 hours, \n\nrespectively. The biexponential decline of the serum concentration of cladribine after subcutaneous \n\nbolus injection is comparable to elimination parameters after 2-hour intravenous infusion with an \n\ninitial and terminal half-life of approximately 2 hours and 11 hours, respectively. The intracellular \n\nretention time of cladribine nucleotides in vivo is clearly prolonged as compared to the retention time \n\nin the plasma: Half-lives t1/2 of initially 15 hours and subsequently more than 30 hours were measured \n\nin leukaemic cells. \n\n \n\nCladribine is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. The renal excretion of unmetabolised cladribine \n\noccurs within 24 hours and accounts for 15% and 18% of the dose after 2-hour intravenous and \n\nsubcutaneous administration, respectively. The fate of the remainder is unknown. The mean plasma \n\nclearance amounts to 794 ml/min after intravenous infusion and to 814 ml/min after subcutaneous \n\nbolus injection at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg body weight/day.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThere are no studies available using cladribine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see also \n\nsection 4.2 and section 4.4). Clinical experience is very limited and safety of LITAK in these patients is \n\nnot well established. LITAK is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or \n\nwith moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric use \n\nThe use of LITAK in children has not been investigated (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nExperience with patients older than 65 years is limited. Elderly patients should be treated by individual \n\nassessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts and of the renal and hepatic function. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCladribine is moderately acutely toxic to mice, with an LD50 of 150 mg/kg by intraperitoneal \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nIn 7- to 14-day continuous intravenous infusion studies in cynomolgus monkeys, the target organs \n\nwere the immune system (\uf0b3 0.3 mg/kg/day), bone marrow, skin, mucous membranes, nervous system \n\nand testes (\uf0b3 0.6 mg/kg/day) and kidneys (\uf0b3 1 mg/kg/day). Unless fatal, indications were that most or \n\nall of these effects would be slowly reversible upon cessation of exposure. \n\n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nCladribine is teratogenic in mice (at doses of 1.5-3.0 mg/kg/day, given on gestation days 6-15). Effects \n\non sternal ossification were seen at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day. Increased resorptions, reduced live litter \n\nsizes, reduced foetal weights and increased foetal malformations of the head, trunk and appendages \n\nwere seen at 3.0 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, cladribine is teratogenic at doses of 3.0 mg/kg/day (given on \n\ngestation days 7-19). At this dose, severe limb anomalies were seen as well as a significant decrease in \n\nthe mean foetal weight. Reduced ossification was observed at 1.0 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis/mutagenesis \n\nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of cladribine have not been \n\nconducted. On the basis of available data, no evaluation can be made of the carcinogenic risk of \n\ncladribine to humans. \n\n \n\nCladribine is a cytotoxic medicinal product, which is mutagenic to cultured mammalian cells. \n\nCladribine is incorporated into DNA strands and inhibits DNA synthesis and repair. Exposure to \n\ncladribine induces DNA fragmentation and cell death in various normal and leukaemic cells and cell \n\nlines at concentrations of 5 nM to 20 \u00b5M. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThe effects of cladribine on fertility have not been studied in animals. However, a toxicity study \n\nconducted with cynomolgus monkeys has shown that cladribine suppresses maturation of rapidly \n\ngenerating cells, including testicular cells. The effect on human fertility is unknown. Antineoplastic \n\nagents, such as cladribine, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected \n\nto have adverse effects on human gametogenesis (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What LITAK is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use LITAK \n3. How to use LITAK \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store LITAK \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What LITAK is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLITAK contains the active substance cladribine. Cladribine is a cytostatic agent. It affects the growth \n\nof malignant (cancerous) white blood cells which play a role in hairy cell leukaemia. LITAK is used to \n\ntreat this disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use LITAK \n\n \n\nDo not use LITAK \n\n- if you are allergic to cladribine or any of the other ingredients of LITAK (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n\n- if you are less than 18 years of age \n\n- if you have moderate to severe kidney or liver impairment \n\n- if you are using other medicines which affect the production of blood cells in the bone marrow \n\n(myelosuppression). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using LITAK. \n\n \n\nAt any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: \n\nexperience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change \n\nin the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss \n\nof sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially \n\nfatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n\n \n\nIf you had these symptoms prior to treatment with cladribine, tell your doctor about any change in \n\nthese symptoms. \n\n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nTell your doctor if you have or have had: \n\n- liver or kidney problems \n\n- infections  \n\n\uf0a7 if you suffer from an infection, this will be treated before you start using LITAK.  \n\uf0a7 if you notice any signs of infections (such as flu-like symptoms or fever) during or after \n\ntreatment with LITAK, inform your doctor immediately.  \n\n- fever \n\n \n\nBefore and during treatment with LITAK, you will have regular blood tests to check whether it is safe \n\nfor you to continue with your treatment. Your doctor may decide that you should receive blood \n\ntransfusions to improve your level of blood cells. In addition, the proper function of your liver and \n\nyour kidneys will be checked.  \n\n \n\nIf you want to father a child, please tell your doctor before treatment with LITAK is started. You \n\nshould not father a child during treatment and up to 6 months after treatment with LITAK. Your \n\ndoctor may advise you about the possibility to store deep-frozen sperm (cryoconservation). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and LITAK \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \n\nmedicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any \n\nmedicines containing:  \n\n- corticosteroids, commonly used to treat inflammation \n\n- antiviral agents, used to treat viral infections \n\n \n\nYou must not use LITAK with other medicines that affect the production of blood cells in the bone \n\nmarrow (myelosuppression). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYour must not use LITAK if you are pregnant. You must take adequate contraceptive precautions \n\nduring therapy and for at least six months after your last LITAK dose. If pregnancy occurs during your \n\ntreatment, you must immediately inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must not breast-feed while you are treated with LITAK and for at least six months after your last \n\nLITAK dose. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nLITAK has a major effect on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel drowsy, which may \n\noccur due to a low number of red blood cells caused by LITAK treatment, or dizzy, you should not \n\ndrive or use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use LITAK \n\n \n\nAlways use LITAK as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate your dose according to your body weight and explain the treatment \n\nschedule in detail. The recommended daily dose is 0.14 mg per kg body weight for five consecutive \n\ndays (single treatment course). \n\n \n\nLITAK has to be injected under your skin (subcutaneous injection), at about the same time each day. \n\nIf you are injecting LITAK yourself, first you must receive adequate training by your doctor or nurse. \n\nYou will find detailed instructions for injection at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nYou may also receive an additional medicine containing the active substance allopurinol in order to \n\nreduce excess of uric acid.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nIf you use more LITAK than you should \n\nIn case you inject an incorrect dose, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use LITAK \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. In case you miss an injection of a dose, \n\ntell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, LITAK can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following during or after treatment with LITAK: \n\n- any signs of infections (such as flu-like symptoms)  \n\n- fever \n\n \n\nRepeated occurrence of malignant (cancerous) disease cannot be excluded. This means that the risk \n\nthat you develop a malignant disease in the future is slightly higher than for healthy people. This \n\nslightly increased risk can be due to hairy cell leukaemia or to therapies used to treat the disease \n\nincluding LITAK. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects may occur: \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n\uf0a7 Infections. \n\uf0a7 Fever. \n\uf0a7 Low numbers of certain white blood cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes) and platelets in blood \n\ntests. \n\n\uf0a7 Low number of red blood cells, which may result in anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness \nand drowsiness. \n\n\uf0a7 Reduced function of your body\u2019s immune system. \n\uf0a7 Headache, dizziness. \n\uf0a7 Abnormal breath sounds, abnormal chest sounds, cough. \n\uf0a7 Feeling sick, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. \n\uf0a7 Skin eruption (rash), swelling, redness as well as soreness around the site of injection, sweating. \n\nSkin reactions are mostly mild to moderate and usually resolve within a few days. \n\n\uf0a7 Tiredness, chills, decreased appetite. \n\uf0a7 Weakness. \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\uf0a7 Repeated occurrence of malignant (cancerous) disease. \n\uf0a7 Low number of platelets, which can cause unusual bleeding (for example nose or skin bleeds).  \n\uf0a7 Sleeplessness, anxiety. \n\uf0a7 Increased heart rate, abnormal heart sound, low blood pressure, decreased blood supply to the \n\nheart muscle. \n\n\uf0a7 Shortness of breath, swelling in lung tissue due to infection, inflammation of mouth and tongue. \n\uf0a7 Abdominal pain and presence of excessive amount of gas in the stomach or bowels, mostly mild \n\nincreases in liver laboratory values (bilirubin, transaminases) which will return to normal values \n\nonce treatment is over. \n\n\uf0a7 Itching, itching skin eruption (urticaria), redness of the skin and skin pain. \n\uf0a7 Swelling in tissues (oedema), not feeling well, pain (muscle pain, joint pain, and bone pain). \n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\uf0a7 Anaemia caused by destruction of red blood cells. \n\uf0a7 Sleepiness, numbness and tingling of the skin, feebleness, inactivity, disorder of peripheral \n\nnerves, confusion, impaired ability to coordinate movements. \n\n\uf0a7 Eye inflammation. \n\uf0a7 Sore throat. \n\uf0a7 Inflammation of a vein. \n\uf0a7 Severe weight loss. \n\n \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1.000 people) \n\n\uf0a7 Reduced liver function. \n\uf0a7 Reduced kidney function. \n\uf0a7 Complications caused by cancer treatment due to break-down of cancer cells. \n\uf0a7 Rejection response to blood transfusions. \n\uf0a7 Increased number of certain white blood cells (eosinophils). \n\uf0a7 Stroke. \n\uf0a7 Disturbances in speech and swallowing. \n\uf0a7 Heart failure. \n\uf0a7 Abnormal heart rhythm. \n\uf0a7 Inability of the heart to maintain adequate blood circulation. \n\uf0a7 Obstruction of the bowels. \n\uf0a7 Serious allergic skin reaction (Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Lyell syndrome). \n \n\nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10.000 people) \n\uf0a7 Depression, epileptic attack. \n\uf0a7 Swelling of the eyelid. \n\uf0a7 Blood clot in the lung. \n\uf0a7 Inflammation of the gallbladder. \n\uf0a7 Reduced function of organs due to high amounts of a specific substance produced by the body \n\n(a glycoprotein). \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

It is important that you do \n\nnot try to give yourself the injection unless you have been instructed by your doctor or nurse. Your \n\ndoctor will tell you how much LITAK you need and how often and when you have to inject yourself. \n\nLITAK should be injected into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). If you have any \n\nquestion with regard to giving the injection, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. \n\n \n\nLITAK is a cytotoxic and should therefore be handled with caution. When LITAK is not \n\nself-administered by the patient, the use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended \n\nwhen handling and administering LITAK. If LITAK contacts the skin or eyes, rinse the involved \n\nsurface immediately with copious amounts of water. Pregnant women must avoid contact with \n\nLITAK. \n\n \n\nWhat do I need for the injection? \n\n \n\nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection, you will need: \n\n \n\n- one vial of LITAK (or two vials if you need to inject more than 5 ml). \n\nDo not use vials which are damaged, or if the solution is not clear or if it contains any particles. \n\n \n\n- one sterile syringe (e.g. 10 ml LUER syringe), \n\n \n\n- one sterile injection needle (e.g. 0.5 x 19 mm, 25 G x \u00be\u2019\u2019), \n\n \n\n- alcohol wipes, \n\n \n\n- a puncture-proof container for safe disposal of the used syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of LITAK? \n \n\n1. Before injection, allow LITAK to warm up to room temperature. \n \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n\n3. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach it. \n \n\nHow do I prepare the injection? \n\n \n\nBefore you inject LITAK, you must do the following: \n\n \n\n1. Remove the red protective cap from the LITAK vial. Do not remove the rubber stopper of the \nvial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with an alcohol wipe. Remove the syringe from the \n\nwrapping without touching the tip of the syringe. Remove the injection needle from the \n\nwrapping and place it firmly on the tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard without \n\ntouching the needle. \n\n \n\n2. Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial and turn the vial and the syringe upside \ndown. Be sure that the tip of the needle is in the solution. \n\n \n\n3. Draw the correct volume of LITAK into the syringe by pulling back the plunger (your doctor \nwill inform you how many ml of LITAK you need to inject). \n\n \n\n4. Pull the needle out of the vial. \n \n\n5. Make sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out. \n \n\n6. Check you have the right volume. \n \n\n7. Inject straight away. \n \n\nWhere should I give my injection? \n\n \n\n \n\n The most suitable places to inject yourself are \nshown here: the top of your thighs and the \n\nabdomen, except for the area around the navel. \n\nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also \n\nuse the outer surface of the upper arms or the \n\nbuttocks. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nHow do I give my injection? \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that no blood vessel has been punctured. If you see blood \n\nin the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place. \n\n \n\n4. Inject the liquid slowly and evenly for approximately one minute, always keeping the skin \n\npinched. \n\n \n\n5. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle. \n\n \n\n6. Put the used syringe in the puncture-proof container. Use a new syringe and injection needle for \n\neach injection. The vials are for single use only. Return any portion of the contents remaining \n\nafter use to your doctor or pharmacist for proper disposal. \n\n \n\nDisposing of used syringes \n\n \n\nPut used syringes into a puncture-proof container and keep it out of the reach and sight of children. \n\n \n\nDispose the puncture-proof container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nDo not put used syringes into the normal household garbage bin. \n\n \n\n1. Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe, \n\nwait for the area to dry and pinch the skin \n\nbetween your thumb and forefinger, without \n\nsqueezing it. \n\n \n\n2. Put the needle fully into the skin at an angle \n\nof about 45\u00b0, as shown in the picture. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

litak can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following during or after treatment with litak: - any signs of infections (such as flu-like symptoms) - fever repeated occurrence of malignant (cancerous) disease cannot be excluded. this means that the risk that you develop a malignant disease in the future is slightly higher than for healthy people. this slightly increased risk can be due to hairy cell leukaemia or to therapies used to treat the disease including litak. the following side effects may occur: very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) infections. fever. low numbers of certain white blood cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes) and platelets in blood tests. low number of red blood cells, which may result in anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and drowsiness. reduced function of your body's immune system. headache, dizziness. abnormal breath sounds, abnormal chest sounds, cough. feeling sick, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. skin eruption (rash), swelling, redness as well as soreness around the site of injection, sweating. skin reactions are mostly mild to moderate and usually resolve within a few days. tiredness, chills, decreased appetite. weakness. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) repeated occurrence of malignant (cancerous) disease. low number of platelets, which can cause unusual bleeding (for example nose or skin bleeds). sleeplessness, anxiety. increased heart rate, abnormal heart sound, low blood pressure, decreased blood supply to the heart muscle. shortness of breath, swelling in lung tissue due to infection, inflammation of mouth and tongue. abdominal pain and presence of excessive amount of gas in the stomach or bowels, mostly mild increases in liver laboratory values (bilirubin, transaminases) which will return to normal values once treatment is over. itching, itching skin eruption (urticaria), redness of the skin and skin pain. swelling in tissues (oedema), not feeling well, pain (muscle pain, joint pain, and bone pain). uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) anaemia caused by destruction of red blood cells. sleepiness, numbness and tingling of the skin, feebleness, inactivity, disorder of peripheral nerves, confusion, impaired ability to coordinate movements. eye inflammation. sore throat. inflammation of a vein. severe weight loss. rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1.000 people) reduced liver function. reduced kidney function. complications caused by cancer treatment due to break-down of cancer cells. rejection response to blood transfusions. increased number of certain white blood cells (eosinophils). stroke. disturbances in speech and swallowing. heart failure. abnormal heart rhythm. inability of the heart to maintain adequate blood circulation. obstruction of the bowels. serious allergic skin reaction (stevens-johnson syndrome or lyell syndrome). very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10.000 people) depression, epileptic attack. swelling of the eyelid. blood clot in the lung. inflammation of the gallbladder. reduced function of organs due to high
