This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZoely 2.5 mg/1.5 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nWhite active film-coated tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate and \n1.5 mg estradiol (as hemihydrate).\nYellow placebo film-coated tablets: The tablet does not contain active substances.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach white active film-coated tablet contains 57.71 mg of lactose monohydrate.\nEach yellow placebo film-coated tablet contains 61.76 mg of lactose monohydrate.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\nActive film-coated tablets: white, round and coded ‘ne’ on both sides.\nPlacebo film-coated tablets: yellow, round and coded ‘p’ on both sides.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOral contraception.\n\nThe decision to prescribe Zoely should take into consideration the individual woman’s current risk \nfactors, particularly those for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and how the risk of VTE with Zoely \ncompares with other combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nOne tablet is to be taken daily for 28 consecutive days. Each pack starts with 24 white active tablets, \nfollowed by 4 yellow placebo tablets. A subsequent pack is started immediately after finishing the \nprevious pack, without a break in daily tablet intake and irrespective of presence or absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding. Withdrawal bleeding usually starts on day 2-3 after intake of the last white tablet \nand may not have finished before the next pack is started. See ‘Cycle control’ in section 4.4.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nAlthough data in renal impaired patients are not available, renal impairment is unlikely to affect the \nelimination of nomegestrol acetate and estradiol.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo clinical studies have been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Since the metabolism \nof steroid hormones might be impaired in patients with severe hepatic disease, the use of Zoely in \nthese women is not indicated as long as liver function values have not returned to normal (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\n\nHow to take Zoely\nTablets must be taken every day at about the same time without regard to meals. Tablets should be \ntaken with some liquid as needed, and in the order as directed on the blister. Stickers marked with the \n7 days of the week are provided. The woman should choose the sticker that starts with the day she \nbegins taking the tablets and stick it on the blister.\n\nHow to start Zoely\nNo preceding hormonal contraceptive use (in the past month)\nTablet-taking has to start on day 1 of the woman’s natural cycle (i.e. the first day of her menstrual \nbleeding). When doing so, no additional contraceptive measures are necessary.\n\nChanging from a combined hormonal contraceptive (combined oral contraceptive (COC), vaginal \nring or transdermal patch)\nThe woman should start with Zoely preferably on the day after the last active tablet (the last tablet \ncontaining the active substances) of her previous COC, but at the latest on the day following the usual \ntablet-free or placebo tablet interval of her previous COC. In case a vaginal ring or transdermal patch \nhas been used, the woman should start using Zoely preferably on the day of removal, but at the latest \nwhen the next application would have been due.\n\nChanging from a progestogen-only-method (minipill, implant, injectable) or from a \nhormone-medicated intra uterine system (IUS)\nThe woman may switch any day from the minipill and Zoely should be started on the next day. An \nimplant or IUS may be removed any day, and Zoely should be started on the day of its removal. When \nchanging from an injectable, Zoely should be started on the day when the next injection would have \nbeen due. In all of these cases, the woman should be advised to additionally use a barrier method until \nshe has completed 7 days of uninterrupted white active tablet-taking.\n\nFollowing first-trimester abortion\nThe woman may start immediately. When doing so, no additional contraceptive measures are necessary.\n\nFollowing delivery or second-trimester abortion\nWomen should be advised to start between day 21 and 28 after delivery or second-trimester abortion. \nWhen starting later, the woman should be advised to additionally use a barrier method until she has \ncompleted 7 days of uninterrupted white active tablet-taking. However, if intercourse has already \noccurred, pregnancy should be excluded before the actual start of COC use or the woman has to wait \nfor her first menstrual period.\nFor breast-feeding women see section 4.6.\n\nManagement of missed tablets\n\nThe following advice only refers to missed white active tablets:\n\nIf the woman is less than 24 hours late in taking any active tablet, contraceptive protection is not \nreduced. The woman should take the tablet as soon as she remembers and should take further tablets at \nthe usual time.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nIf she is 24 or more hours late in taking any active tablet, contraceptive protection may be reduced. \nThe management of missed tablets can be guided by the following two basic rules:\n 7 days of uninterrupted ‘white active tablet’-taking are required to attain adequate suppression \n\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-axis.\n The more ‘white active tablets’ are missed and the closer the missed tablets are to the 4 yellow \n\nplacebo tablets, the higher the risk of a pregnancy.\n\nDay 1-7\nThe user should take the last missed white tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking \ntwo tablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time. In addition, a barrier \nmethod such as a condom should be used until she has completed 7 days of uninterrupted white tablet-\ntaking. If intercourse took place in the preceding 7 days, the possibility of a pregnancy should be \nconsidered.\nDay 8-17\nThe user should take the last missed white tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking \ntwo tablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time. Provided that the \nwoman has taken her tablets correctly in the 7 days preceding the first missed tablet, there is no need \nto use extra contraceptive precautions. However, if she has missed more than 1 tablet, the woman \nshould be advised to use extra precautions until she has completed 7 days of uninterrupted white \ntablet-taking.\nDay 18-24\nThe risk of reduced reliability is imminent because of the forthcoming yellow placebo tablet phase. \nHowever, by adjusting the tablet-intake schedule, reduced contraceptive protection can still be \nprevented. By adhering to either of the following two options, there is therefore no need to use extra \ncontraceptive precautions, provided that in the 7 days preceding the first missed tablet the woman has \ntaken all tablets correctly. If this is not the case, she should follow the first of these two options and \nuse extra precautions for the next 7 days as well.\n1. The user should take the last missed tablet as soon as she remembers, even if this means taking \n\ntwo tablets at the same time. She then continues to take tablets at her usual time until the active \ntablets are used up. The 4 placebo tablets from the last row must be discarded. The next blister \npack must be started right away. The user is unlikely to have a withdrawal bleed until the end of \nthe active tablets section of the second pack, but she may experience spotting or breakthrough \nbleeding on tablet-taking days.\n\n2. The woman may also be advised to discontinue active tablet-taking from the current blister \npack. She should then take placebo tablets from the last row for a maximum of 3 days such that \nthe total number of placebo plus missed white active tablets is not more than 4, and \nsubsequently continue with the next blister pack.\n\nIf the woman missed tablets and subsequently has no withdrawal bleed in the placebo tablet phase, the \npossibility of a pregnancy should be considered.\n\nPlease note: If the user is not sure about the number or colour of tablets missed and what advice to \nfollow, a barrier method should be used until she has completed 7 days of uninterrupted white active \ntablet-taking.\n\nYellow placebo tablets missed\n\nContraceptive protection is not reduced. Yellow tablets from the last (4th) row of the blister can be \ndisregarded. However, the missed tablets should be discarded to avoid unintentionally prolonging the \nplacebo tablet phase.\n\nAdvice in case of gastro-intestinal disturbances\n\nIn case of severe gastro-intestinal disturbance (e.g., vomiting or diarrhoea), absorption of the active \nsubstances may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken.\nIf vomiting occurs within 3-4 hours after white tablet-taking, the tablet should be considered as missed \nand a new tablet should be taken as soon as possible. The new tablet should be taken within 24 hours \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nof the usual time of tablet-taking if possible. The next tablet should then be taken at the usual time. If \n24 or more hours have passed since last tablet intake, the advice concerning missed tablets, as given in \nsection 4.2 \"Management of missed tablets\", is applicable. If the woman does not want to change her \nnormal tablet-taking schedule, she has to take the extra white tablet(s) from another pack.\n\nHow to shift periods or how to delay a period\n\nTo delay a period the woman should continue with another blister pack of Zoely without taking the \nyellow placebo tablets from her current pack. The extension can be carried on for as long as wished \nuntil the end of the white active tablets in the second pack. Regular intake of Zoely is then resumed \nafter the yellow placebo tablets have been taken of the second pack. During the extension the woman \nmay experience breakthrough-bleeding or spotting.\n\nTo shift her periods to another day of the week than the woman is used to with her current scheme, she \ncan be advised to shorten her forthcoming yellow placebo tablet phase with a maximum of 4 days. The \nshorter the interval, the higher the risk that she does not have a withdrawal bleed and may experience \nbreakthrough-bleeding and spotting during the subsequent pack (just as when delaying a period).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nCombined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) must not be used in the following conditions. As no \nepidemiological data are yet available with 17β-estradiol containing CHCs, the contraindications for \nethinylestradiol containing CHCs are considered applicable to the use of Zoely. Should any of the \nconditions appear for the first time during Zoely use, the medicinal product should be stopped\nimmediately.\n\n Presence or risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\no Venous thromboembolism - current VTE (on anticoagulants) or history of (e.g. deep \n\nvenous thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]).\no Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for venous thromboembolism, such as \n\nAPC-resistance (including Factor V Leiden), antithrombin-III-deficiency, protein C \ndeficiency, protein S deficiency.\n\no Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation (see section 4.4).\no A high risk of venous thromboembolism due to the presence of multiple risk factors (see \n\nsection 4.4).\n Presence or risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE)\n\no Arterial thromboembolism - current arterial thromboembolism, history of arterial \nthromboembolism (e.g. myocardial infarction) or prodromal condition (e.g. angina \npectoris).\n\no Cerebrovascular disease – current stroke, history of stroke or prodromal condition (e.g.\ntransient ischaemic attack, TIA).\n\no Known hereditary or acquired predisposition for arterial thromboembolism, such as \nhyperhomocysteinaemia and antiphospholipid-antibodies (anticardiolipin-antibodies, \nlupus anticoagulant).\n\no History of migraine with focal neurological symptoms.\no A high risk of arterial thromboembolism due to multiple risk factors (see section 4.4) or \n\nto the presence of one serious risk factor such as:\n diabetes mellitus with vascular symptoms\n severe hypertension\n severe dyslipoproteinaemia.\n\n Pancreatitis or a history thereof if associated with severe hypertriglyceridaemia.\n Presence or history of severe hepatic disease as long as liver function values have not returned \n\nto normal.\n Presence or history of liver tumours (benign or malignant).\n Known or suspected sex steroid-influenced malignancies (e.g., of the genital organs or the \n\nbreasts).\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n Presence or history of meningioma.\n Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWarnings\nIf any of the conditions or risk factors mentioned below is present, the suitability of Zoely should be \ndiscussed with the woman.\n\nIn the event of aggravation, or first appearance of any of these conditions or risk factors, the woman \nshould be advised to contact her doctor to determine whether the use of Zoely should be discontinued. \nAll data presented below are based upon epidemiological data obtained with CHCs containing \nethinylestradiol. Zoely contains 17β-estradiol. As no epidemiological data are yet available with \nestradiol containing-CHCs, the warnings are considered applicable to the use of Zoely.\n\nRisk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n The use of any combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) increases the risk of venous \n\nthromboembolism (VTE) compared with no use. Products that contain levonorgestrel,\nnorgestimate or norethisterone are associated with the lowest risk of VTE. It is not yet \nknown how the risk with Zoely compares with these lower risk products. The decision to \nuse any product other than one known to have the lowest VTE risk should be taken only \nafter a discussion with the woman to ensure she understands the risk of VTE with CHCs, \nhow her current risk factors influence this risk, and that her VTE risk is highest in the \nfirst ever year of use. There is also some evidence that the risk is increased when a CHC is \nre-started after a break in use of 4 weeks or more.\n\n In women who do not use a CHC and are not pregnant about 2 out of 10,000 will develop a \nVTE over the period of one year. However, in any individual woman, the risk may be far \nhigher, depending on her underlying risk factors (see below).\n\n Epidemiological studies in women who use low dose (< 50 µg ethinylestradiol) combined \nhormonal contraceptives have found that out of 10,000 women between 6 and 12 will develop a \nVTE in one year.\n\n It is estimated that out of 10,000 women who use a levonorgestrel-containing CHC about 61 will \ndevelop a VTE in one year.\n\n It is not yet known how the risk of VTE with CHCs that contain nomegestrol acetate in \ncombination with estradiol compares with the risk with low dose levonorgestrel-containing \nCHCs.\n\n The number of VTEs per year with low dose CHCs is fewer than the number expected in \nwomen during pregnancy or in the postpartum period.\n\n VTE may be fatal in 1-2 % of cases.\n Extremely rarely, thrombosis has been reported to occur in CHC users in other blood vessels, \n\ne.g. hepatic, mesenteric, renal, or retinal veins and arteries.\n\nRisk factors for VTE\nThe risk for venous thromboembolic complications in CHC users may increase substantially in a \nwoman with additional risk factors, particularly if there are multiple risk factors (see table).\n\nZoely is contraindicated if a woman has multiple risk factors that put her at high risk of venous \nthrombosis (see section 4.3). If a woman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase \nin risk is greater than the sum of the individual factors – in this case her total risk of VTE should be \nconsidered. If the balance of benefits and risks is considered to be negative, a CHC should not be\nprescribed (see section 4.3).\n\n                                                     \n1\n\nMid-point of range of 5-7 per 10,000 WY, based on a relative risk for CHCs containing levonorgestrel versus non-use of approximately 2.3 to 3.6\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nTable: Risk factors for VTE\nRisk factor Comment\n\nObesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m²) Risk increases substantially as BMI rises.\n\nParticularly important to consider if other risk \nfactors also present.\n\nProlonged immobilisation, major surgery, any \nsurgery to the legs or pelvis, neurosurgery, or \nmajor trauma\n\nNote: Temporary immobilisation including air \ntravel > 4 hours can also be a risk factor for VTE, \nparticularly in women with other risk factors.\n\nIn these situations it is advisable to discontinue \nuse of the pill (in the case of elective surgery at \nleast four weeks in advance) and not resume until \ntwo weeks after complete remobilisation. Another\nmethod of contraception should be used to avoid \nunintentional pregnancy.\n\nAntithrombotic treatment should be considered if \nZoely has not been discontinued in advance.\n\nPositive family history (venous thromboembolism \never in a sibling or parent especially at a \nrelatively early age, e.g., before 50)\n\nIf a hereditary predisposition is suspected, the \nwoman should be referred to a specialist for \nadvice before deciding about any CHC use.\n\nOther medical conditions associated with VTE Cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome, chronic \ninflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or \nulcerative colitis) and sickle cell disease\n\nIncreasing age Particularly above 35 years\n\n There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins and superficial thrombophlebitis \nin the onset or progression of venous thrombosis.\n\n The increased risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy, and particularly the 6-week period of the \npuerperium, must be considered (for information on \"Pregnancy and lactation\" see section 4.6).\n\nSymptoms of VTE (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)\nIn the event of symptoms women should be advised to seek urgent medical attention and to inform the \nhealthcare professional that she is taking a CHC.\nSymptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can include:\n\n- unilateral swelling of the leg and/or foot or along a vein in the leg;\n- pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only when standing or walking;\n- increased warmth in the affected leg; red or discoloured skin on the leg.\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) can include:\n- sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath or rapid breathing;\n- sudden coughing which may be associated with haemoptysis;\n- sharp chest pain;\n- severe light headedness or dizziness;\n- rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n\nSome of these symptoms (e.g. “shortness of breath”, “coughing”) are non-specific and might be \nmisinterpreted as more common or less severe events (e.g. respiratory tract infections).\nOther signs of vascular occlusion can include: sudden pain, swelling and slight blue discoloration of \nan extremity.\nIf the occlusion occurs in the eye symptoms can range from painless blurring of vision which can \nprogress to loss of vision. Sometimes loss of vision can occur almost immediately.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nRisk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE)\nEpidemiological studies have associated the use of CHCs with an increased risk for arterial \nthromboembolism (myocardial infarction) or for cerebrovascular accident (e.g., transient ischaemic \nattack, stroke). Arterial thromboembolic events may be fatal.\n\nRisk factors for ATE\nThe risk of arterial thromboembolic complications or of a cerebrovascular accident in CHC users \nincreases in women with risk factors (see table). Zoely is contraindicated if a woman has one serious \nor multiple risk factors for ATE that puts her at high risk of arterial thrombosis (see section 4.3). If a \nwoman has more than one risk factor, it is possible that the increase in risk is greater than the sum of \nthe individual factors – in this case her total risk should be considered. If the balance of benefits and \nrisks is considered to be negative a CHC should not be prescribed (see section 4.3).\n\nTable: Risk factors for ATE\nRisk factor Comment\nIncreasing age Particularly above 35 years\n\nSmoking Women should be advised not to smoke if they \nwish to use a CHC. Women over 35 who continue \nto smoke should be strongly advised to use a \ndifferent method of contraception.\n\nHypertension\n\nObesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m2) Risk increases substantially as BMI increases.\n\nParticularly important in women with\nadditional risk factors\n\nPositive family history (arterial thromboembolism \never in a sibling or parent especially at relatively \nearly age, e.g., below 50)\n\nIf a hereditary predisposition is suspected, the \nwoman should be referred to a specialist for \nadvice before deciding about any CHC use.\n\nMigraine An increase in frequency or severity of migraine \nduring CHC use (which may be prodromal of a \ncerebrovascular event) may be a reason for \nimmediate discontinuation.\n\nOther medical conditions associated with\nadverse vascular events\n\nDiabetes mellitus, hyperhomocysteinaemia,\nvalvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation,\ndyslipoproteinaemia and systemic lupus\nerythematosus\n\nSymptoms of ATE\nIn the event of symptoms women should be advised to seek urgent medical attention and to inform the \nhealthcare professional that she is taking a CHC.\nSymptoms of a cerebrovascular accident can include:\n\n- sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body;\n- sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination;\n- sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding;\n- sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;\n- sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known cause;\n- loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure.\n\nTemporary symptoms suggest the event is a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nSymptoms of a myocardial infarction (MI) can include:\n- pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness, sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm, or\n\nbelow the breastbone;\n- discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, arm, stomach;\n- feeling of being full, having indigestion or choking;\n- sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness;\n- extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath;\n- rapid or irregular heartbeats.\n\nTumours\n An increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users of COCs (> 5 years) has been reported in \n\nsome epidemiological studies, but there continues to be controversy about the extent to which \nthis finding is attributable to the confounding effects of sexual behaviour and other factors such \nas human papilloma virus (HPV). No epidemiological data on the risk of cervical cancer in \nusers of Zoely are available.\n\n With the use of the higher-dosed COCs (50 g ethinylestradiol) the risk of endometrial and \novarian cancer is reduced. Whether this also applies to 17β-estradiol-containing COCs remains \nto be confirmed.\n\n A meta-analysis from 54 epidemiological studies reported that there is a slightly increased \nrelative risk (RR = 1.24) of having breast cancer diagnosed in women who are currently using \nCOCs. The excess risk gradually disappears during the course of the 10 years after cessation of \nCOC use. Because breast cancer is rare in women under 40 years of age, the excess number of \nbreast cancer diagnoses in current and recent COC users is small in relation to the overall risk of \nbreast cancer. The breast cancers diagnosed in ever-users tend to be less advanced clinically \nthan the cancers diagnosed in never-users. The observed pattern of increased risk may be due to \nan earlier diagnosis of breast cancer in COC users, the biological effects of COCs or a \ncombination of both.\n\n In rare cases, benign liver tumours, and even more rarely, malignant liver tumours have been \nreported in users of COCs. In isolated cases, these tumours have led to life-threatening \nintra-abdominal haemorrhages. Therefore, a hepatic tumour should be considered in the \ndifferential diagnosis when severe upper abdominal pain, liver enlargement or signs of \nintra-abdominal haemorrhage occur in women taking COCs.\n\nMeningioma\nThe occurrence of meningioma (single and multiple) has been reported with prolonged use (several \nyears) of nomegestrol monotherapy at doses of 3.75 mg or 5 mg daily and higher. If a meningioma is \ndiagnosed in a patient treated with Zoely, treatment should be stopped (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatitis C\n During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) combination drug regimen \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times \nthe upper limit of normal (ULN) were significantly more frequent in women using\nethinylestradiol-containing medications such as CHCs. Women using medications containing\noestrogens other than ethinylestradiol, such as estradiol, had a rate of ALT elevation similar to \nthose not receiving any oestrogens; however, due to the limited number of women taking these \nother oestrogens, caution is warranted for co-administration with the combination drug regimen\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir. See section 4.5.\n\nOther conditions\n Women with hypertriglyceridaemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of \n\npancreatitis when using COCs.\n Although small increases in blood pressure have been reported in many women taking COCs, \n\nclinically relevant increases are rare. A relationship between COC use and clinical hypertension \nhas not been established. However, if a sustained clinically significant hypertension develops \nduring the use of a COC, then it is prudent for the physician to suspend the intake of the tablets \nand treat the hypertension. Where considered appropriate, COC use may be resumed if \nnormotensive values can be achieved with antihypertensive therapy.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n The following conditions have been reported to occur or deteriorate with both pregnancy and \nCOC use, but the evidence of an association with COC use is inconclusive: jaundice and/or \npruritus related to cholestasis; gallstone formation; porphyria; systemic lupus erythematosus; \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome; Sydenham’s chorea; herpes gestationis; otosclerosis-related \nhearing loss.\n\n In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous oestrogens may induce or exacerbate \nsymptoms of angioedema.\n\n Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use \nuntil markers of liver function return to normal. Recurrence of cholestatic jaundice which occurred \nfirst during pregnancy or previous use of sex steroids necessitates the discontinuation of COCs.\n\n Although COCs may have an effect on peripheral insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, there \nis no evidence for a need to alter the therapeutic regimen in diabetics using low-dose COCs \n(containing  0.05 mg ethinylestradiol). However, diabetic women should be carefully observed \nwhile taking a COC, especially in the first months of use.\n\n Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and worsening of depression have been associated with COC \nuse.\n\n Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. \nWomen with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation \nwhilst taking COCs.\n\n Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n Depressed mood and depression are well-known undesirable effects of hormonal contraceptive \nuse (see section 4.8). Depression can be serious and is a well-known risk factor for suicidal \nbehaviour and suicide. Women should be advised to contact their physician in case of mood \nchanges and depressive symptoms, including shortly after initiating the treatment.\n\nMedical examination/consultation\nPrior to the initiation or reinstitution of Zoely use a complete medical history (including family \nhistory) should be taken and pregnancy must be ruled out. Blood pressure should be measured and a \nphysical examination should be performed, guided by the contraindications (see section 4.3) and \nwarnings (see section 4.4). It is important to draw a woman’s attention to the information on venous \nand arterial thrombosis, including the risk of Zoely compared with other CHCs, the symptoms of VTE \nand ATE, the known risk factors and what to do in the event of a suspected thrombosis.\n\nThe woman should also be instructed to carefully read the user leaflet and to adhere to the advice \ngiven. The frequency and nature of examinations should be based on established practice guidelines \nand be adapted to the individual woman.\n\nWomen should be advised that hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infections (AIDS) \nand other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nReduced efficacy\nThe efficacy of COCs may be reduced in the event of e.g., missed tablets (see section 4.2), \ngastro-intestinal disturbances during active tablet-taking (see section 4.2) or use of concomitant \nmedicinal products that decrease the plasma concentrations of nomegestrol acetate and/or estradiol \n(see section 4.5).\n\nCycle control\nWith all COCs, irregular bleeding (spotting or breakthrough bleeding) may occur, especially during \nthe first months of use. Therefore, the evaluation of any irregular bleeding is only meaningful after an \nadaptation interval of about 3 cycles. The percentage of women using Zoely experiencing intracyclic \nbleeding after this adaptation period ranged from 15-20 %.\n\nIf bleeding irregularities persist or occur after previously regular cycles, then non-hormonal causes \nshould be considered and adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to exclude malignancy or \npregnancy. These may include curettage.\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nThe duration of the withdrawal bleeding in women using Zoely is on average 3-4 days. Users of Zoely \nmay also miss their withdrawal bleeding although not being pregnant. During clinical trials, absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding ranged over the cycles 1-12 from 18 % to 32 %. In such cases, absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding was not associated with a higher occurrence of breakthrough bleeding/spotting in \nthe subsequent cycles. 4.6 % of the women did not have a withdrawal bleeding in the first three cycles \nof use and the occurrences of absence of withdrawal bleeding in the later cycles of use were high in \nthis subgroup, ranging from 76 % to 87 % of women. 28 % of the women experienced absence of \nwithdrawal bleeding in at least one of the cycles 2, 3 and 4, associated with higher occurrences of \nabsence of withdrawal bleeding in the later cycles of use, ranging from 51 % to 62 %.\n\nIf absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs and Zoely has been taken according to the instructions as \ndescribed in section 4.2, it is unlikely that the woman is pregnant. However, pregnancy must be ruled \nout before Zoely use is continued, if Zoely has not been taken as directed or if two consecutive \nwithdrawal bleedings are missed.\n\nPaediatric population\nIt is unknown whether the amount of estradiol in Zoely is sufficient to maintain adequate levels of \nestradiol in adolescents, especially for bone mass accrual (see section 5.2).\n\nLaboratory tests\nThe use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, including \nbiochemical parameters of liver, thyroid, adrenal and renal function, plasma levels of (carrier) \nproteins, e.g., corticosteroid binding globulin and lipid/lipoprotein fractions, parameters of \ncarbohydrate metabolism and parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Changes generally remain \nwithin the normal laboratory range.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteractions\nNote: The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify \npotential interactions.\n\nInfluence of other medicinal products on Zoely\nInteractions between oral contraceptives and enzyme-inducing medicinal products may lead to \nbreakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure.\n\nHepatic metabolism: Interactions can occur with substances that induce CYP450 enzymes, resulting in\nreduced concentrations of sex hormones and decreased effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives, \nincluding Zoely. These substances are represented mostly with anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamazepine,\ntopiramate, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbazepine, felbamate); anti-infective drugs (e.g. \nrifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin); St. John’s wort; bosentan and HIV or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (e.g. efavirenz).\n\nEnzyme induction can occur after a few days of treatment. Maximal enzyme induction is generally \nobserved within a few weeks. After drug therapy is discontinued, enzyme induction can last for about \n28 days.\n\nA barrier contraceptive method should also be used during the concomitant use of an enzyme inducer,\nand for 28 days after its discontinuation. In case of long-term treatment with hepatic enzyme-inducing \nsubstances another method of contraception should be considered.\n\nIf concomitant drug administration runs beyond the end of the active tablets in the current blister pack, \nthe next blister pack should be started right away without the usual placebo tablet interval.\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nConcomitant administration of strong (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) or moderate \n(e.g. fluconazole, diltiazem, erythromycin) CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the serum concentrations \nof oestrogens or progestogens.\n\nMedicinal product interaction studies were not performed with Zoely, but two studies with rifampicin \nand ketoconazole, respectively, were performed with a higher dosed nomegestrol acetate-estradiol \ncombination (nomegestrol acetate 3.75 mg + 1.5 mg estradiol) in post-menopausal women. \nConcomitant use of rifampicin decreases the AUC0-∞ of nomegestrol acetate by 95 % and increases the \nAUC0-tlast of estradiol by 25 %. Concomitant use of ketoconazole (200 mg single dose) does not \nmodify estradiol metabolism whereas increases in the peak concentration (85 %) and AUC0-∞ (115 %) \nof nomegestrol acetate were observed, which were of no clinical relevance. Similar conclusions are \nexpected in women of childbearing potential.\n\nInfluence of Zoely on other medicinal products\nContraceptives containing ethinylestradiol may decrease the concentrations of lamotrigine by \napproximately 50%. Attention should be paid, notably when introducing a combined contraceptive, \neven with estradiol, in a well-equilibrated woman given lamotrigine.\n\nOther interactions\nDuring clinical trials with the HCV combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with \nand without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were \nsignificantly more frequent in women using ethinylestradiol-containing medications such as CHCs. \nWomen using medications containing oestrogens other than ethinylestradiol, such as estradiol, had a \nrate of ALT elevation similar to those not receiving any oestrogens; however, due to the limited \nnumber of women taking these other oestrogens, caution is warranted for co-administration with the \ncombination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nZoely is not indicated during pregnancy.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs while taking Zoely, further intake should be stopped. Most epidemiological \nstudies have revealed neither an increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who used \nethinylestradiol-containing COCs prior to pregnancy, nor a teratogenic effect when \nethinylestradiol-containing COCs were taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.\n\nClinical data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effect of Zoely on the \nfoetus or neonate.\n\nIn animal studies, reproductive toxicity has been observed with the nomegestrol acetate / estradiol \ncombination (see preclinical safety data in section 5.3).\n\nThe increased risk of VTE during the postpartum period should be considered when re-starting Zoely \n(see section 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\nSmall amounts of the contraceptive steroids and/or their metabolites may be excreted with the breast \nmilk, but there is no evidence that this adversely affects infant health.\n\nBreastfeeding may be influenced by COCs as they may reduce the quantity and change the \ncomposition of breast milk. Therefore, the use of COCs should not be recommended until the breast-\nfeeding mother has completely weaned her child and an alternative contraceptive method should be \nproposed to women wishing to breastfeed.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nFertility\nZoely is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy. For information on return to fertility, see \nsection 5.1.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZoely has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nSix multi-centre clinical trials of up to one year duration were used to evaluate safety of Zoely. In total \n3,434 women, aged 18-50, were enrolled and completed 33,828 cycles.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nPossibly related adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing use \nwith Zoely are listed in the table below.\n\nAll adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common ( 1/10), common \n( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse reaction in MedDRA Term1\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nincreased \nappetite, fluid \nretention\n\ndecreased \nappetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders decreased libido, \ndepression/ \ndepressed mood, \nmood altered\n\nincreased libido\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nheadache, \nmigraine\n\ncerebrovascular \naccident,\ntransient \nischaemic attack, \ndisturbance in \nattention\n\nEye disorders contact lens \nintolerance/dry \neye\n\nVascular disorders hot flush venous \nthromboembolism\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nnausea abdominal \ndistension\n\ndry mouth\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\ncholelithiasis, \ncholecystitis\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nacne hyperhydrosis, \nalopecia, \npruritus, dry \nskin, seborrhea\n\nchloasma, \nhypertrichosis\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nsensation of \nheaviness\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse reaction in MedDRA Term1\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders\n\nabnormal \nwithdrawal \nbleeding\n\nmetrorrhagia, \nmenorrhagia, \nbreast pain, \npelvic pain\n\nhypomenorrhoea, \nbreast swelling, \ngalactorrhoea, \nuterine spasm, \npremenstrual \nsyndrome, breast \nmass, \ndyspareunia, \nvulvovaginal \ndryness\n\nvaginal odour, \nvulvovaginal \ndiscomfort\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nirritability, \noedema\n\nhunger\n\nInvestigations weight increased hepatic enzyme \nincreased\n\n1The most appropriate MedDRA term to describe a certain adverse reaction is listed. Synonyms or related \nconditions are not listed, but should be taken into account as well.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in \nZoely users (frequency unknown).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nAn increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events, including myocardial \ninfarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been \nobserved in women using CHCs, which are discussed in more detail in section 4.4.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nMultiple doses up to five times the daily dose of Zoely and single doses up to 40 times the daily dose \nof nomegestrol acetate alone have been used in women without safety concern. On the basis of general \nexperience with combined oral contraceptives, symptoms that may occur are: nausea, vomiting and, in \nyoung girls, slight vaginal bleeding. There are no antidotes and further treatment should be \nsymptomatic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, progestogens and \noestrogens, fixed combinations, ATC code: G03AA14.\n\nMechanism of action\nNomegestrol acetate is a highly selective progestogen derived from the naturally occurring steroid \nhormone, progesterone. Nomegestrol acetate has a strong affinity for the human progesterone receptor \nand has an anti-gonadotropic activity, a progesterone receptor-mediated anti-oestrogenic activity, a \nmoderate anti-androgenic activity, and is devoid of any oestrogenic, androgenic, glucocorticoid or \nmineralocorticoid activity.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nThe oestrogen contained in Zoely is 17β-estradiol, a natural oestrogen identical to the endogenous \nhuman 17β-estradiol.\n\nThe contraceptive effect of Zoely is based on the interaction of various factors, the most important of \nwhich are seen as the inhibition of ovulation and the changes in the cervical secretion.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn two randomized, open-label, comparative efficacy-safety trials, more than 3,200 women have been \ntreated for up to 13 consecutive cycles with Zoely and more than 1,000 women with drospirenone \n3 mg – ethinylestradiol 30 μg (21/7 regimen).\nIn the Zoely group, acne was reported by 15.4 % of the women (versus 7.9 % in the comparator \ngroup), weight increased was reported by 8.6 % of the women (versus 5.7 % in the comparator group), \nand abnormal withdrawal bleeding (predominantly absence of withdrawal bleeding) was reported by \n10.5 % of the women (versus 0.5 % in the comparator group).\n\nIn the clinical trial performed with Zoely in the European Union the following Pearl Indices for the \nage class 18-35 years were calculated:\n\nMethod failure: 0.40 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 1.03)\nMethod and user failure: 0.38 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 0.97)\n\nIn the clinical trial performed with Zoely in the United States the following Pearl Indices for the age \nclass 18-35 years were calculated:\n\nMethod failure: 1.22 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.18)\nMethod and user failure: 1.16 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.08)\n\nIn a randomized, open label trial, 32 women were treated for 6 cycles with Zoely.\nAfter discontinuation of Zoely, return to ovulation in the first 28 days after last tablet intake was \nobserved in 79 % of the women.\n\nEndometrial histology was investigated in a subgroup of women (n=32) in one clinical study after \n13 cycles of treatment. There were no abnormal results.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo data on efficacy and safety are available in adolescents below 18 years. Available pharmacokinetic \ndata are described in section 5.2.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNomegestrol acetate\n\nAbsorption\nOrally administered nomegestrol acetate is rapidly absorbed.\nMaximum plasma concentrations of nomegestrol acetate of about 7 ng/mL are reached at 2 h after \nsingle administration. The absolute bioavailability of nomegestrol acetate after a single dose is 63 %. \nNo clinically relevant effect of food was observed on the bioavailability of nomegestrol acetate.\n\nDistribution\nNomegestrol acetate is extensively bound to albumin (97-98 %), but does not bind to sex hormone \nbinding globulin (SHBG) or corticoid binding globulin (CBG). The apparent volume of distribution of \nnomegestrol acetate at steady-state is 1,645  576 L.\n\nBiotransformation\nNomegestrol acetate is metabolized into several inactive hydroxylated metabolites by liver \ncytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 with possible contribution of CYP2C19 \nand CYP2C8. Nomegestrol acetate and its hydroxylated metabolites undergo extensive phase 2 \n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nmetabolism to form glucuronide- and sulphate conjugates. The apparent clearance at steady state is \n26 L/h.\n\nElimination\nThe elimination half-life (t1/2) is 46 h (ranging from 28-83 h) at steady state. The elimination half-life \nof metabolites was not determined.\nNomegestrol acetate is excreted via urine and faeces. Approximately 80 % of the dose is excreted in \nurine and faeces within 4 days. Excretion of nomegestrol acetate was nearly complete after 10 days \nand amounts excreted were higher in faeces than in urine.\n\nLinearity\nDose-linearity was observed in the range 0.625-5 mg (assessed in fertile and post-menopausal \nwomen).\n\nSteady-state conditions\nThe pharmacokinetics of nomegestrol acetate are not influenced by SHBG.\nSteady-state is achieved after 5 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of nomegestrol acetate of about \n12 ng/mL are reached 1.5 h after dosing. Average steady state plasma concentrations are 4 ng/mL.\n\nDrug drug interactions\nNomegestrol acetate causes in vitro no notable induction or inhibition of any cytochrome P450 \nenzymes and has no clinically relevant interaction with the P-gp transporter.\n\nEstradiol\n\nAbsorption\nEstradiol is subject to a substantial first-pass effect after oral administration. The absolute \nbioavailability is about 1 %. No clinically relevant effect of food was observed on the bioavailability \nof estradiol.\n\nDistribution\nThe distribution of exogenous and endogenous estradiol is similar. Oestrogens are widely distributed \nin the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. \nEstradiol circulates in the blood bound to SHBG (37 %) and to albumin (61 %), while only \napproximately 1-2 % is unbound.\n\nBiotransformation\nOral exogenous estradiol is extensively metabolized. The metabolism of exogenous and endogenous \nestradiol is similar. Estradiol is rapidly transformed in the gut and the liver in several metabolites, \nmainly estrone, which are subsequently conjugated and undergo entero-hepatic circulation. There is a \ndynamic equilibrium between estradiol, estrone and estrone-Sulfate due to various enzymatic activities \nincluding estradiol-dehydrogenases, sulfotransferases and aryl sulfatases. Oxidation of estrone and \nestradiol involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP1A2, CYP1A2 (extra hepatic), CYP3A4, \nCYP3A5, and CYP1B1 and CYP2C9.\n\nElimination\nEstradiol is rapidly cleared from the circulation. Due to metabolism and enterohepatic circulation, a \nlarge circulating pool of oestrogen sulfates and glucuronides is present. This results in a highly \nvariable baseline-corrected elimination half-life of estradiol, which is calculated to be 3.6 ± 1.5 h, after \nintravenous administration.\n\nSteady-state conditions\nMaximum serum concentrations of estradiol are about 90 pg/mL and are reached 6 h after dosing. \nAverage serum concentrations are 50 pg/mL and these estradiol levels correspond with the early and \nlate phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of nomegestrol acetate (primary objective) after single oral dosing of Zoely in \nhealthy postmenarcheal female adolescents and adult subjects were similar. However, after single oral \ndosing, for the estradiol component (secondary objective), the exposure was 36 % lower in adolescents \nversus adult subjects. The clinical relevance of this result is unknown.\n\nEffect of renal impairment\nNo studies were performed to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of Zoely.\n\nEffect of hepatic impairment\nNo studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of Zoely. \nHowever, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function.\n\nEthnic groups\nNo formal studies were performed to assess pharmacokinetics in ethnic groups.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat dose toxicity studies with estradiol, nomegestrol acetate or combination have indicated \nexpected oestrogenic and gestagen effects.\nReproductive toxicity studies performed with the combination have shown foetotoxicity which is \nconsistent with estradiol exposure.\nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with the combination. Nomegestrol \nacetate is not genotoxic.\nHowever, it must be borne in mind that sex steroids can promote the growth of certain \nhormone-dependent tissues and tumours.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nZoely 2.5 mg/1.5 mg film-coated tablets\nnomegestrol acetate/estradiol\n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nImportant things to know about combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs):\n They are one of the most reliable reversible methods of contraception if used correctly.\n They slightly increase the risk of having a blood clot in the veins and arteries, especially in the \n\nfirst year or when restarting a combined hormonal contraceptive following a break of 4 or more \nweeks.\n\n Please be alert and see your doctor if you think you may have symptoms of a blood clot (see \nsection 2 “Blood clots”).\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Zoely is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Zoely\n3. How to use Zoely\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Zoely\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zoely is and what it is used for\n\nZoely is a contraceptive pill that is used to prevent pregnancy.\n\n All 24 white film-coated tablets are active tablets that contain a small amount of two different \nfemale hormones. These are nomegestrol acetate (a progestogen) and estradiol (an oestrogen).\n\n The 4 yellow tablets are inactive tablets that do not contain hormones and are called placebo \ntablets.\n\n Contraceptive pills that contain two different hormones, like Zoely, are called ‘combined pills’.\n Estradiol, the oestrogen in Zoely, is identical to the hormone produced by your ovaries during a \n\nmenstrual cycle.\n Nomegestrol acetate, the progestogen in Zoely, is derived from the hormone progesterone. \n\nProgesterone is produced by your ovaries during a menstrual cycle.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Zoely\n\nGeneral notes\n\nBefore you start using Zoely you should read the information on blood clots (thrombosis) in section 2.\nIt is particularly important to read the symptoms of a blood clot – see section 2 “Blood clots”.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nBefore you can begin taking Zoely, your doctor will ask you some questions about your personal \nhealth history and that of your close relatives. The doctor will also measure your blood pressure and, \ndepending upon your personal situation, may also carry out some other tests.\n\nIn this leaflet, several situations are described where you should stop taking the pill, or where the \nreliability of the pill may be decreased. In such situations you should not have sexual intercourse or \nyou should take extra non-hormonal contraceptive precautions, e.g., use a condom or another barrier \nmethod. Do not use rhythm or temperature methods. These methods can be unreliable because the pill \nalters the usual changes in temperature and cervical mucus that occur during the menstrual cycle.\n\nZoely, like other hormonal contraceptives, does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or any \nother sexually transmitted disease.\n\nDo not use Zoely\nYou must not use Zoely if you have any of the conditions listed below. If you do have any of the \nconditions listed below, you must tell your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you what other form \nof birth control would be more appropriate.\n\n if you have (or have ever had) a blood clot in a blood vessel of your legs (deep vein thrombosis,\nDVT), your lungs (pulmonary embolus, PE) or other organs;\n\n if you know you have a disorder affecting your blood clotting - for instance, protein C \ndeficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin – III deficiency, Factor V Leiden or \nantiphospholipid antibodies;\n\n if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see section ‘Blood clots);\n if you have ever had a heart attack or a stroke;\n if you have (or have ever had) angina pectoris (a condition that causes severe chest pain and\n\nmay be a first sign of a heart attack) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA – temporary stroke\nsymptoms);\n\n if you have any of the following diseases that may increase your risk of a clot in the arteries:\n– severe diabetes with blood vessel damage\n– very high blood pressure\n– a very high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol or triglycerides);\n– a condition known as hyperhomocysteinaemia\n\n if you have (or have ever had) a type of migraine called ‘migraine with aura’;\n if you have (had) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) associated with high levels of fat \n\nin your blood;\n if you have (had) severe liver disease and your liver is not yet working normally;\n if you have (had) a benign or malignant tumour in the liver;\n if you have (had), or if you may have, cancer of the breast or the genital organs;\n in case of presence or history of meningioma (generally benign tumour of the tissue located \n\nbetween the brain and the skull). In case of doubt, contact your doctor.\n if you have any unexplained bleeding from the vagina;\n if you are allergic to estradiol or nomegestrol acetate, or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6).\n\nIf any of these conditions appear for the first time while using Zoely, stop taking it at once and tell \nyour doctor. In the meantime, use a non-hormonal contraceptive. See also ‘General Notes’ in section 2 \nabove.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nWhen to take special care with Zoely\n\nWhen should you contact your doctor?\n\nSeek urgent medical attention\n\n if you notice possible signs of a blood clot that may mean you are suffering from a blood clot in \nthe leg (i.e., deep vein thrombosis), a blood clot in the lung (i.e., pulmonary embolism), a heart \nattack or a stroke (see “Blood clots” section below).\n\nFor a description of the symptoms of these serious side effects please go to “How to recognise a blood \nclot”.\n if you notice any changes in your own health, especially involving any of the items mentioned \n\nin this leaflet (see also in section 2 ‘Do not use Zoely’; do not forget about the changes in the \nhealth of your immediate family);\n\n if you feel a lump in your breast;\n if you experience symptoms of angioedema such as swollen face, tongue and/or throat and/or \n\ndifficulty swallowing or hives together with difficulty breathing;\n if you are going to use other medicines (see also in section 2 ‘Other medicines and Zoely’);\n if you are to be immobilised or are to have surgery (tell your doctor at least four weeks in \n\nadvance);\n if you have unusual, heavy vaginal bleeding;\n if you forgot one or more tablets in the first week of the blister pack and had unprotected \n\nintercourse in the seven days before (see also in section 3 ‘If you forget to take Zoely’);\n if you have severe diarrhoea or experience severe vomiting;\n if you miss periods and suspect you may be pregnant (do not start the next blister pack until \n\nyour doctor tells you, see also in section 3 ‘If you have missed one or more periods’).\n\nTell your doctor if any of the following conditions apply to you.\nIf the condition develops, or gets worse while you are using Zoely, you should also tell your doctor.\n if you have hereditary angioedema. Consult your doctor immediately if you experience \n\nsymptoms of angioedema such as swollen face, tongue and/or throat and/or difficulty \nswallowing or hives, together with difficulty breathing. Products containing oestrogens may \ninduce or worsen symptoms of angioedema;\n\n if a close relative has or has ever had breast cancer;\n if you have epilepsy (see in section 2 ‘Other medicines and Zoely’);\n if you have liver disease (for instance jaundice) or gallbladder disease (for instance gallstones);\n if you have diabetes;\n if you have depression;\n if you have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory bowel disease);\n if you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE - a disease affecting your natural defence \n\nsystem);\n if you have haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS - a disorder of blood clotting causing failure of \n\nthe kidneys);\n if you have sickle cell anaemia (an inherited disease of the red blood cells);\n if you have elevated levels of fat in the blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) or a positive family \n\nhistory for this condition. Hypertriglyceridaemia has been associated with an increased risk of \ndeveloping pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas);\n\n if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see in section 2 ‘Blood\nclots).\n\n if you have just given birth you are at an increased risk of blood clots. You should ask your \ndoctor how soon after delivery you can start taking Zoely.\n\n if you have an inflammation in the veins under the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis);\n if you have varicose veins.\n if you have a condition that occurred for the first time or worsened during pregnancy or\n\nprevious use of sex hormones (e.g. hearing loss, porphyria [a disease of the blood], herpes \n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\ngestationis [skin rash with vesicles during pregnancy], Sydenham’s chorea [a disease of the \nnerves in which sudden movements of the body occur] (see in section 2 ‘When should you \ncontact your doctor’);\n\n if you have (or have ever had) chloasma [yellowish-brown pigment patches, so called \n‘pregnancy patches’, particularly on the face]. If so, avoid too much exposure to the sun or \nultraviolet light;\n\nBLOOD CLOTS\n\nUsing a combined hormonal contraceptive such as Zoely increases your risk of developing a blood \nclot compared with not using one. In rare cases a blood clot can block blood vessels and cause serious \nproblems.\n\nBlood clots can develop\n in veins (referred to as ‘venous thrombosis’, ‘venous thromboembolism’ or VTE)\n in the arteries (referred to as an ‘arterial thrombosis’, ‘arterial thromboembolism’ or ATE).\nRecovery from blood clots is not always complete. Rarely, there may be serious lasting effects or, very \nrarely, they may be fatal.\n\nIt is important to remember that the overall risk of a harmful blood clot due to Zoely is small.\n\nHOW TO RECOGNISE A BLOOD CLOT\n\nSeek urgent medical attention if you notice any of the following signs or symptoms.\n\nAre you experiencing any of these signs? What are you possibly \nsuffering from?\n\n swelling of one leg or along a vein in the leg or foot especially when \naccompanied by:\n\n pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only when \nstanding or walking\n\n increased warmth in the affected leg\n change in colour of the skin on the leg e.g. turning pale, red or \n\nblue\n\nDeep vein thrombosis\n\n sudden unexplained breathlessness or rapid breathing;\n sudden cough without an obvious cause, which may bring up blood;\n sharp chest pain which may increase with deep breathing;\n severe light headedness or dizziness;\n rapid or irregular heartbeat;\n severe pain in your stomach;\n\nIf you are unsure, talk to a doctor as some of these symptoms such as \ncoughing or being short of breath may be mistaken for a milder condition \nsuch as a respiratory tract infection (e.g., a ‘common cold’).\n\nPulmonary embolism\n\nSymptoms most commonly occur in one eye:\n immediate loss of vision or\n painless blurring of vision which can progress to loss of vision\n\nRetinal vein thrombosis\n(blood clot in the eye)\n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\n chest pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness\n sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm or below the \n\nbreastbone;\n fullness, indigestion or choking feeling;\n upper body discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, arm and \n\nstomach;\n sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness;\n extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath;\n rapid or irregular heartbeats\n\nHeart attack\n\n sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, especially on \none side of the body;\n\n sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding;\n sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;\n sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination;\n sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known cause;\n loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure.\n\nSometimes the symptoms of stroke can be brief with an almost immediate \nand full recovery, but you should still seek urgent medical attention as you \nmay be at risk of another stroke.\n\nStroke\n\n swelling and slight blue discolouration of an extremity;\n severe pain in your stomach (acute abdomen).\n\nBlood clots blocking \nother blood vessels\n\nBLOOD CLOTS IN A VEIN\n\nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in a vein?\n The use of combined hormonal contraceptives has been connected with an increase in the risk of \n\nblood clots in the vein (venous thrombosis). However, these side effects are rare. Most \nfrequently, they occur in the first year of use of a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n If a blood clot forms in a vein in the leg or foot it can cause a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n If a blood clot travels from the leg and lodges in the lung it can cause a pulmonary embolism.\n Very rarely a clot may form in a vein in another organ such as the eye (retinal vein thrombosis).\n\nWhen is the risk of developing a blood clot in a vein highest?\nThe risk of developing a blood clot in a vein is highest during the first year of taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive for the first time. The risk may also be higher if you restart taking a combined \nhormonal contraceptive (the same product or a different product) after a break of 4 weeks or more.\n\nAfter the first year, the risk gets smaller but is always slightly higher than if you were not using a \ncombined hormonal contraceptive.\n\nWhen you stop Zoely your risk of a blood clot returns to normal within a few weeks.\n\nWhat is the risk of developing a blood clot?\nThe risk depends on your natural risk of VTE and the type of combined hormonal contraceptive you \nare taking.\n\nThe overall risk of a blood clot in the leg or lung (DVT or PE) with Zoely is small.\n Out of 10,000 women who are not using any combined hormonal contraceptive and are not \n\npregnant, about 2 will develop a blood clot in a year.\n Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains \n\nlevonorgestrel, norethisterone, or norgestimate, about 5-7 will develop a blood clot in a year.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\n It is not yet known how the risk of a blood clot with Zoely compares to the risk with a combined \nhormonal contraceptive that contains levonorgestrel.\n\n The risk of having a blood clot will vary according to your personal medical history (see \n“Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot” below).\n\nRisk of developing a blood clot \nin a year\n\nWomen who are not using a combined hormonal pill and are not \npregnant\n\nAbout 2 out of 10,000 women\n\nWomen using a combined hormonal contraceptive pill containing \nlevonorgestrel, norethisterone or norgestimate\n\nAbout 5-7 out of 10,000 women\n\nWomen using Zoely Not yet known\n\nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in a vein\nThe risk of a blood clot with Zoely is small but some conditions will increase the risk. Your risk is \nhigher:\n if you are very overweight (body mass index or BMI over 30 kg/m2);\n if one of your immediate family has had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ at a young \n\nage (e.g., below the age of about 50). In this case you could have a hereditary blood clotting \ndisorder;\n\n if you need to have an operation, or if you are off your feet for a long time because of an injury \nor illness, or you have your leg in a cast. The use of Zoely may need to be stopped several \nweeks before surgery or while you are less mobile. If you need to stop Zoely ask your doctor \nwhen you can start using it again.\n\n as you get older (particularly above about 35 years);\n if you gave birth less than a few weeks ago\n\nThe risk of developing a blood clot increases the more conditions you have.\nAir travel (> 4 hours) may temporarily increase your risk of a blood clot, particularly if you have some \nof the other factors listed.\nIt is important to tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you, even if you are unsure. Your \ndoctor may decide that Zoely needs to be stopped.\nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using Zoely, for example a close family member \nexperiences a thrombosis for no known reason or you gain a lot of weight, tell your doctor.\n\nBLOOD CLOTS IN AN ARTERY\n\nWhat can happen if a blood clot forms in an artery?\nLike a blood clot in a vein, a clot in an artery can cause serious problems. For example, it can cause a \nheart attack or a stroke.\n\nFactors that increase your risk of a blood clot in an artery\n\nIt is important to note that the risk of a heart attack or stroke from using Zoely is very small but can \nincrease:\n\n with increasing age (beyond about 35 years);\n if you smoke. When using a combined hormonal contraceptive like Zoely you are advised to \n\nstop smoking. If you are unable to stop smoking and are older than 35 your doctor may advise \nyou to use a different type of contraceptive;\n\n if you are overweight;\n if you have high blood pressure;\n if a member of your immediate family has had a heart attack or stroke at a young age (less than \n\nabout 50). In this case you could also have a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke;\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\n if you, or someone in your immediate family, have a high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol\nor triglycerides);\n\n if you get migraines, especially migraines with aura;\n if you have a problem with your heart (valve disorder, disturbance of the rhythm called atrial\n\nfibrillation)\n if you have diabetes.\n\nIf you have more than one of these conditions or if any of them are particularly severe, the risk of \ndeveloping a blood clot may be increased even more.\nIf any of the above conditions change while you are using Zoely, for example, you start smoking, a \nclose family member experiences a thrombosis for no known reason or you gain a lot of weight, tell \nyour doctor.\n\nCancer\nBreast cancer has been found slightly more often in women using combined pills, but it is not known \nwhether this is caused by the combined pills. For example, it may be that tumours are found more in \nwomen on combined pills because they are examined by the doctor more often. After stopping the \ncombined pill, the increased risk gradually reduces.\nIt is important to check your breasts regularly and you should contact your doctor if you feel any \nlump. You should also tell your doctor if a close relative has, or ever had breast cancer (see section 2\n“When to take special care with Zoely”).\n\nIn rare cases, benign (noncancerous) liver tumours, and in even fewer cases malignant (cancerous) \nliver tumours have been reported in pill users. Contact your doctor if you have unusual severe \nabdominal pain.\n\nCervical cancer is caused by an infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). It has been reported \nto occur more often in women using the pill for more than 5 years. It is unknown if this finding is due \nto the use of hormonal contraceptives or to other factors, such as difference in sexual behaviour.\n\nMeningiomas\nCases of meningioma (generally benign tumours of the brain) have been reported with prolonged use \n(several years) of nomegestrol monotherapy (without estradiol) at higher doses of 3.75 and 5 mg and\nmore (see section ‘Do not use Zoely’). If a meningioma is diagnosed, treatment with Zoely should be \nstopped.\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nSome women using hormonal contraceptives including Zoely have reported depression or depressed \nmood. Depression can be serious and may sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts. If you experience \nmood changes and depressive symptoms contact your doctor for further medical advice as soon as \npossible.\n\nLaboratory tests\nIf you are having any blood or urinary test, tell your doctor that you are using Zoely as it may affect \nthe results of some tests.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nNo data on efficacy and safety are available in adolescents below 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Zoely\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.\nAlso tell any other doctor or dentist who prescribes another medicine (or the dispensing pharmacist) \nthat you use Zoely.\n There are medicines that can make Zoely less effective in preventing pregnancy, or can cause \n\nunexpected bleeding. These include medicines used to treat:\n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\n– epilepsy (e.g. primidone, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, \ntopiramate, felbamate);\n\n– tuberculosis (e.g. rifampicin);\n– HIV infections (e.g. rifabutin, ritonavir, efavirenz);\n– Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (e.g. boceprevir, telaprevir);\n– other infectious diseases (e.g. griseofulvin);\n– high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs (bosentan).\n\n The herbal product St. John’s wort may also stop Zoely from working properly. If you want to \nuse herbal products containing St. John’s wort while you are already using Zoely you should \nconsult your doctor first.\n\n If you are taking medicines or herbal products that might make Zoely less effective, a barrier \ncontraceptive method should also be used. Since the effect of another medicine on Zoely may \nlast up to 28 days after stopping the medicine, it is necessary to use the additional barrier \ncontraceptive method for that long.\n\n Some medicines can increase the levels of the active substances of Zoely in the blood. The \neffectiveness of the pill is maintained, but tell your doctor if you are using anti-fungal medicines \ncontaining ketoconazole.\n\n Zoely may also interfere with the working of other medicines – such as the anti-epileptic \nlamotrigine.\n\n The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or\nwithout dasabuvir may cause increases in liver function blood test results (increase in ALT liver \nenzyme) in women using CHCs containing ethinylestradiol. Zoely contains estradiol instead of \nethinylestradiol. It is not known whether an increase in ALT liver enzyme can occur when using \nZoely with this HCV combination drug regimen. Your doctor will advise you.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nZoely must not be used by women who are pregnant, or who think they may be pregnant. If you get \npregnant while using Zoely you should stop using Zoely and contact your doctor.\nIf you want to stop Zoely because you want to get pregnant, see in section 3 ‘If you stop taking Zoely’.\n\nZoely is not usually recommended for use during breast-feeding. If you wish to use the pill while \nbreast-feeding, please seek the advice of your doctor.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZoely has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machines.\n\nZoely contains lactose\nZoely contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to use Zoely\n\nWhen and how to take the tablets\nThe Zoely blister contains 28 tablets: 24 white tablets with the active substances (number 1-24) and \n4 yellow tablets without active substances (number 25-28).\n\nEach time you start a new blister of Zoely, take the number 1 white active tablet in the left-hand top \ncorner (see ‘Start’). Choose from the 7 stickers with day indicators the one in the grey column that \nbegins with your starting day. For example, if you start on a Wednesday, use the day label sticker that \nstarts with ‘WED’. Stick it on the blister, just above the row of white active tablets where it reads \n‘Place day label here’. This allows you to check whether you took your daily tablet.\nTake one tablet each day at about the same time, with some water if necessary.\nFollow the direction of the arrows on the blister, so use the white active tablets first and then the \nyellow placebo tablets.\n\n \n\n\n\n37\n\nYour period will start during the 4 days that you use the yellow placebo tablets (so-called withdrawal \nbleeding). Usually it will start 2-3 days after the last white active tablet and may not have finished \nbefore the next blister is started.\nStart taking your next blister immediately after the last yellow tablet, even if your period hasn’t \nfinished. This means that you will always start a new blister on the same day of the week, and also that \nyou have your period on roughly the same days each month.\nSome users may not have their period every month during the intake of the yellow tablets. If you have \ntaken Zoely every day according to these directions, it is unlikely that you are pregnant (see also \nsection 3 ‘If you have missed one or more periods’).\n\nStarting your first pack of Zoely\n\nWhen no hormonal contraceptive has been used in the past month\nStart taking Zoely on the first day of your cycle (i.e. the first day of your menstrual bleeding). Zoely \nwill work immediately. You do not need to use an additional contraceptive method.\n\nWhen changing from another combined hormonal contraceptive (combined pill, vaginal ring, or \ntransdermal patch)\nYou can start taking Zoely the day after you have taken the last tablet from your present pill blister \n(this means no tablet-free break). If your present pill blister also contains inactive (placebo) tablets you \ncan start Zoely on the day after taking the last active tablet (if you are not sure which this is, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist). You can also start later, but never later than the day following the tablet-free \nbreak of your present pill (or the day after the last inactive tablet of your present pill). In case you use \na vaginal ring or transdermal patch, it is best to start using Zoely on the day you remove the ring or \npatch. You can also start, at the latest, on the day you would have started using the next ring or patch.\nIf you follow these instructions, it is not necessary to use an additional contraceptive method.\n\nWhen changing from a progestogen-only pill (minipill)\nYou can stop taking the minipill any day and start taking Zoely the next day. But if you are having \nintercourse, make sure you also use a barrier method of contraception for the first 7 days that you are \ntaking Zoely.\n\nWhen changing from a progestogen-only injectable, implant or a hormone-medicated intrauterine \nsystem (IUS)\nStart using Zoely when your next injection is due or on the day that your implant or IUS is removed. \nBut if you are having intercourse, make sure you also use a barrier method of contraception for the \nfirst 7 days that you are taking Zoely.\n\nAfter having a baby\nYou can start Zoely between 21 and 28 days after having a baby. If you start later than day 28, you \nshould also use a barrier method of contraception during the first 7 days of Zoely use. If, after having a \nbaby, you have had sexual intercourse before starting Zoely, be sure that you are not pregnant or wait \nuntil the next menstrual period. If you want to start Zoely after having a baby and are breast-feeding, \nsee also section 2 ‘Pregnancy and Breast-feeding’.\nAsk your doctor what to do if you are not sure when to start.\n\nAfter a miscarriage or an abortion\nFollow the advice of your doctor.\n\nIf you take more Zoely than you should\nThere have been no reports of serious harmful effects from taking too many Zoely tablets at one time. \nIf you have taken several tablets at a time, you may have nausea, vomiting or vaginal bleeding. If you \ndiscover that a child has taken Zoely, ask your doctor for advice.\n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nIf you forget to take Zoely\n\nThe following advice only refers to missed white active tablets.\n if you are less than 24 hours late in taking a tablet, the reliability of the pill is maintained. Take \n\nthe tablet as soon as you remember and take the next tablets at the usual time.\n if you are 24 or more hours late in taking any tablet, the reliability of the pill may be reduced. \n\nThe more consecutive tablets you have missed, the higher the risk that the contraceptive \nefficacy is decreased. There is a particularly high risk of becoming pregnant if you miss white\nactive tablets at the beginning or at the end of the blister. Therefore you should follow the rules \ngiven below.\n\nDay 1-7 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule)\nTake the last white active missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time) and take the next tablet at the usual time. However, use a barrier method such \nas a condom as an extra precaution until you have taken your tablets correctly for 7 days in a row.\nIf you had sexual intercourse in the week before missing the tablets, there is a possibility of becoming \nor being pregnant. So contact your doctor immediately.\n\nDay 8-17 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule)\nTake the last missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two tablets at the same \ntime) and take the next tablets at the usual time. If you have taken your tablets correctly in the 7 days \nprior to the missed tablet, the protection against pregnancy is not reduced, and you do not need to use \nextra precautions. However, if you have missed more than 1 tablet, use a barrier method such as a \ncondom as an extra precaution until you have taken your tablets correctly for 7 days in a row.\n\nDay 18-24 of white active tablet intake (see picture and schedule)\nThere is a particularly high risk of becoming pregnant if you miss white active tablets close to the \nyellow placebo tablet interval. By adjusting your intake schedule this higher risk can be prevented.\n\nThe following two options can be followed. You do not need to use extra precautions if you have \ntaken your tablets correctly in the 7 days prior to the missed tablet. If this is not the case, you should \nfollow the first of these two options and use a barrier method such as a condom as an extra precaution \nuntil you have taken your tablets correctly for 7 days in a row.\nOption 1)\nTake the last missed white active tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two \ntablets at the same time) and take the next tablets at the usual time. Start the next blister as soon as the \nwhite active tablets in the current blister are finished, so skip the yellow placebo tablets. You may \nnot have your period until you take the yellow placebo tablets at the end of the second blister, but you \nmay have spotting (drops or flecks of blood) or breakthrough bleeding while taking the white active \ntablets.\nOption 2)\nStop taking the white active tablets and start taking the yellow placebo tablets for a maximum of 3 \ndays so that the total number of placebo plus missed white active tablets is not more than 4. At the end \nof the placebo tablet interval, start the next blister.\n\nIf you cannot remember how many white active tablets you have missed, follow the first option, use a \nbarrier method such as a condom as an extra precaution until you have taken your tablets correctly for \n7 days in a row, and contact your doctor (as you may not have been protected from being pregnant).\nIf you have forgotten to take white active tablets in a blister, and you do not have the expected \nmonthly period while taking the yellow placebo tablets from the same blister, you may be pregnant. \nConsult your doctor before you start with the next blister.\n\nYellow placebo tablets missed\nThe last 4 yellow tablets of the fourth row are placebo tablets which do not contain active substances. \nIf you forgot to take one of these tablets the reliability of Zoely is maintained. Throw away the yellow \nplacebo tablet(s) you missed and continue taking the next tablets at the usual time.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nPicture\n\nSchedule: if you are 24 or more hours late taking white tablets\n\nIf you vomit or have severe diarrhoea\nIf you vomit within 3-4 hours of taking a white active tablet, or you have severe diarrhoea, the active \ningredients of your Zoely tablet may not have been completely absorbed into your body. The situation \nis similar to if you forget a white active tablet. After vomiting or diarrhoea, you must take another \nwhite active tablet from a reserve blister as soon as possible. If possible take it within 24 hours of \nwhen you normally take your pill. Take the next tablet at the usual time. If this is not possible or 24 or \nmore hours have passed, you should follow the advice given under \"If you forget to take Zoely\". If \nyou have severe diarrhoea, please tell your doctor.\nThe yellow tablets are placebo tablets which do not contain active substances. If you vomit or have \nsevere diarrhoea within 3-4 hours of taking a yellow tablet, the reliability of Zoely is maintained.\n\nIf you want to delay your period\nYou can delay your period by not taking the yellow placebo tablets and going straight to a new blister \nof Zoely. You may experience light or menstruation-like bleeding while using this second blister. \nWhen you wish your period to begin during the second blister, stop taking the white active tablets and \nstart taking the yellow placebo tablets. After finishing the 4 yellow placebo tablets from the second \nblister, start with the next (third) blister.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nIf you want to change the starting day of your period\nIf you take the tablets according to the instructions, then your period will begin during the placebo \ndays. If you have to change this day, reduce the number of placebo days – when you take the yellow \nplacebo tablets – (but never increase them – 4 is the maximum). For example, if you start taking the \nplacebo tablets on Friday, and you want to change this to a Tuesday (3 days earlier) you must start a \nnew blister 3 days earlier than usual. You may not have any bleeding during the shortened period of \nyellow placebo tablet intake. While using the next blister you may have some spotting (drops or flecks \nof blood) or breakthrough bleeding on white active tablet-taking days.\nIf you are not sure what to do, consult your doctor.\n\nIf you have unexpected bleeding\nWith all combined pills, for the first few months, you can have some irregular vaginal bleeding \n(spotting or breakthrough bleeding) between your periods. You may need to use sanitary protection, \nbut keep taking your tablets as usual. Irregular vaginal bleeding usually stops once your body has \nadjusted to the pill (usually after about 3 months). If bleeding continues, becomes heavy or starts \nagain, contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have missed one or more periods\nClinical trials with Zoely have shown that you may occasionally miss your regular monthly period \nafter Day 24.\n If you have taken all the tablets correctly, and you have not vomited or had severe diarrhoea, or \n\nused other medicines, then it is very unlikely that you are pregnant. Keep taking Zoely as usual. \nSee also in section 3 ‘If you vomit or have severe diarrhoea’ or in section 2 ‘Other medicines \nand Zoely’.\n\n If you have not taken all the tablets correctly, or if your expected period does not happen twice \nin a row, you may be pregnant. Contact your doctor immediately. Do not start the next blister of \nZoely until your doctor has checked that you are not pregnant.\n\nIf you stop taking Zoely\nYou can stop taking Zoely at any time. If you do not want to become pregnant, first ask your doctor \nabout other methods of birth control.\nIf you stop taking Zoely because you want to get pregnant, you are recommended to wait until you \nhave had a natural period before trying to conceive. This will help you to determine when the baby \nwill be due.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\nIf you get any side effect, particularly if severe or persistent, or have any change to your health that \nyou think may be due to Zoely, please talk to your doctor.\n\nAn increased risk of blood clots in your veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) or blood clots in \nyour arteries (arterial thromboembolism (ATE)) is present for all women taking combined hormonal \ncontraceptives. For more detailed information on the different risks from taking combined hormonal \ncontraceptives, please see section 2, “What you need to know before you use Zoely”.\nThe following side effects have been linked with the use of Zoely:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n acne\n changes to menstrual periods (e.g. absence or irregularity)\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n decreased interest in sex; depression/depressed mood; mood changes\n headache or migraine\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\n feeling sick (nausea)\n heavy menstrual periods; breast pain; pelvic pain\n weight gain\n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n increased appetite; fluid retention (oedema)\n hot flush\n swollen abdomen\n increased sweating; hair loss; itching; dry skin; oily skin\n heaviness in limbs\n regular but scanty periods; larger breasts; breast lump; milk production while not pregnant; \n\npremenstrual syndrome; pain during intercourse; dryness in the vagina or vulva; spasm of the \nuterus\n\n irritability\n increased liver enzymes\n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n harmful blood clots in a vein or artery, for example:\n\no in a leg or foot (i.e., DVT)\no in a lung (i.e., PE)\no heart attack\no stroke\no mini-stroke or temporary stroke-like symptoms known as a transient ischaemic attack \n\n(TIA)\no blood clots in the liver, stomach/intestine, kidneys or eye.\n\nThe chance of having a blood clot may be higher if you have any other conditions that increase this \nrisk.
