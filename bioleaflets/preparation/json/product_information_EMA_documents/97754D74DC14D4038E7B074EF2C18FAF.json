CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nSUSTIVA is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-\n1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and weighing at least 3.5 kg. \n\nSUSTIVA has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients \nwith CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or after failure of protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. \nAlthough cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present \ninsufficient data on the efficacy of subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of \nregimens containing SUSTIVA. \n\n\n\n3\n\nFor a summary of clinical and pharmacodynamic information, see section 5.1. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n\nPosology \n\nEfavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5). \n\nIn order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is \nrecommended (see section 4.8). \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 600 mg orally, once daily. \n\nDose adjustment \n\nIf efavirenz is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be \nincreased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose must be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg \nonce daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be \nrestored (see section 4.5). \n\nIf efavirenz is coadministered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the \ndose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5). \n\nChildren and adolescents (3 months to 17 years) \n\nThe recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with a PI and/or NRTIs for patients between 3 \nmonths and 17 years of age is described in Table 1. Efavirenz intact hard capsules must only be \nadministered to children who are able to reliably swallow hard capsules.  \n\nTable 1: Paediatric dose to be administered once daily* \n\nBody Weight efavirenz Number of Capsules or \nTablets and Strength to \n\nAdminister \nkg Dose (mg) \n\n3.5 to < 5 100 one 100 mg capsule\n\n5 to < 7.5 150 one 100 mg capsule + one \n50 mg capsule \n\n7.5 to < 15 200 one 200 mg capsule \n15 to < 20 250 one 200 mg capsule + one \n\n50 mg capsule\n20 to < 25 300 three 100 mg capsules\n\n25 to < 32.5 350 three 100 mg capsules + \none 50 mg capsule\n\n32.5 to < 40 400 two 200 mg capsules\n≥ 40 600 one 600 mg tablet OR \n\nthree 200 mg capsules\n\n*For information on the bioavailability of the capsule contents mixed with food vehicles, see \nsection 5.2. \n\n\n\n4\n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, \nless than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal \nimpairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4). \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. \nPatients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system \nsymptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of 3 months or weighing less than \n3.5 kg have not been established. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nIt is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach. The increased efavirenz \nconcentrations observed following administration of efavirenz with food may lead to an increase in \nfrequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n\nPatients who cannot swallow  \n\nCapsule sprinkle: for patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg who cannot swallow \ncapsules, the capsule contents can be administered with a small amount of food using the capsule \nsprinkle method of administration (see section 6.6 for instructions). No additional food should be \nconsumed for up to 2 hours after administration of efavirenz.. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2). \n\nCo-administraion with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or \nergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) \nbecause competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the \npotential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, \nprolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5). \n\nCo-administration with elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) due to the potential for significant \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of EBR and GZR (see section 4.5). \n\nHerbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased \nplasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients with: \n\n- a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on \n\nelectrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. \n\n- a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with \n\ncongestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. \n\n- severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. \n\n\n\n5\n\nPatients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval (proarrythmic).  \n\nThese drugs include: \n\n- antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, \n\n- neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, \n\n- certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, \n\nimidazole and triazole antifungal agents, \n\n- certain non-sedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), \n\n- cisapride, \n\n- flecainide, \n\n- certain antimalarials,  \n\n- methadone. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nEfavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a failing \nregimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice \nof new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration \nthe potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1). \n\nCo-administration of efavirenz with the fixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with \nrifampicin). \n\nCoadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir/ voxilaprevir with efavirenz is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \nCoadministration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma \nconcentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Coadministration \nof glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nConcomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nWhen prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should refer to the \ncorresponding Summary of Product Characteristics. \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n\nIf any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected \nintolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of all antiretroviral \nmedicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon \nresolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of \nantiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential for selection of resistant virus. \n\nRash\n\nMild-to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with \ncontinued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and \nhasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration \nhas been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of erythema \nmultiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. Efavirenz must be discontinued in \n\n\n\n6\n\npatients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or \nfever. If therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting \ntherapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8). \n\nExperience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class \nis limited (see section 4.8). Efavirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening \ncutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI. \n\nPsychiatric symptoms \n\nPsychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a \nprior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse \nreactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, \npsychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms \nsuch as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately \nto assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to \ndetermine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8). \n\nNervous system symptoms \n\nSymptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and \nabnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg \ndaily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one \nor two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed \nthat if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are \nnot predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. \n\nSeizures \n\nConvulsions have been observed in adult and paediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the \npresence of known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant \nmedicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and \nphenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, \ncarbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with \nefavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. \n\nHepatic events \n\nA few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic \ndisease or other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be \nconsidered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. \n\nQTc Prolongation \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  \n\nConsider alternatives to efavirenz for coadministration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de \nPointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.  \n\nEffect of food \n\nThe administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may \nlead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \nefavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. \n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the \nsetting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases \nevidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any \nparticular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV \ntreatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nLiver disease \n\nEfavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and \nnot recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to \ndetermine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated \nmetabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution \nmust be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should \nbe monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. \nLaboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see \nsection 4.2). \n\nThe safety and efficacy of efavirenz has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver \nfunction abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to \nstandard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum \ntransaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued \ntherapy with efavirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8). \n\nIn patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver \nenzymes is also recommended. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please \nrefer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\n\n\n8\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, \nless than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal \nimpairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in \npatients with severe renal failure and close safety monitoring is recommended in this population. \n\nElderly patients \n\nInsufficient numbers of elderly patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether \nthey respond differently than younger patients. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nEfavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 months of age or who weigh less than 3.5 kg. \nTherefore, efavirenz should not be given to children less than 3 months of age. \n\nRash was reported in 59 of 182 children (32%) treated with efavirenz  and was severe in six patients. \nProphylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may \nbe considered. \n\nLactose \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nEfavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of \nthese enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In \nvitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially \nincrease the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with \nnarrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; \nhowever, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with \nsubstrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2). \n\nEfavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or \nfood (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or \nherbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these \nenzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s \nwort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nQT Prolonging Drugs \n\nEfavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval \nand Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant \nagents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides,  \nfluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics \n(terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3). \n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\nContraindications of concomitant use \n\nEfavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, \ntriazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, \n\n\n\n9\n\nergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-\nthreatening events (see section 4.3). \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir \n\nConcomitant administration of efavirenz with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may \nlead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir. This loss is due to significant decreases in \nelbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3). \n\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\nCo-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is \ncontraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due \nto induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is \nalready taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. \nEfavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need \nadjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of \ntreatment. (see section 4.3). \n\nOther interactions \n\nInteractions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease \ninhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “q8h” or \n“q12h”). If available, 90% or 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were \nconducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.  \n\nTable 2: Interactions between efavirenz and other medicinal products in adults \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, \n\nCmin with confidence intervals if \navailablea \n\n(mechanism) \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nefavirenz \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nHIV antivirals \nProtease inhibitors (PI) \nAtazanavir/ ritonavir/Efavirenz \n(400 mg once daily/100 mg once \ndaily/600 mg once daily, all \nadministered with food) \n\nAtazanavir (pm): \nAUC: ↔* (↓9 to ↑10) \nCmax: ↑17%* (↑8 to ↑27)\nCmin: ↓42%* (↓31 to ↓51)\n\nCo-administration of efavirenz \nwith atazanavir/ritonavir is not \nrecommended.

False-positive urine cannabinoid \ntest results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects \nreceiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass \nspectrometry is recommended in such cases. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nSee below and section 5.3. Efavirenz should not be used during pregnancy, unless the patient’s clinical \ncondition requires such treatment. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing \nbefore initiation of efavirenz.  \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nBarrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for \nexample, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-life of \nefavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is \nrecommended.  \n\nPregnancy \n\n\n\n22\n\nThere have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including \nmeningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-\ncontaining fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective \nand 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with the \nfixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. \nA causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the \ndenominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development \n(at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. \n\nAs of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 \npregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. \nOne child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth \ndefects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as well as \nthose in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges \nfrom 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births. \n\nMalformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3). \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nEfavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of efavirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the infant can not be excluded. Breast-feeding should \nbe discontinued during treatment with SUSTIVA. It is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n\nFertility \n\nThe effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that \nachieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given \nrecommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male \nor female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid), and did not affect sperm or offspring of treated male rats \n(doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given \nefavirenz was not affected.  \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nEfavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be \ninstructed that if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such \nas driving or operating machinery. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEfavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received \n600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients \nwere rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%). The most \nnotable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. Nervous \nsystem symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 \nweeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric \nadverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and \nseizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. The administration of efavirenz with \nfood may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse \nreactions (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n23\n\nThe long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) \nin which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration \n180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + \nlamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not \nassociated with any new safety concerns. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions of moderate or greater severity with at least possible relationship to treatment \nregimen (based on investigator attribution) reported in clinical trials of efavirenz at the recommended \ndose in combination therapy (n = 1,008) are listed below.

The frequency category of \"rare\" was \ndefined per A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (rev. 2, Sept 2009) on the \nbasis of an estimated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 0 events given the number of \npatients treated with efavirenz in these clinical trials (n=3,969). \n\nRash \n\nIn clinical studies, 26% of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared \nwith 17% of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18% of \npatients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz, \nand 1.7% discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. \n\nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two \nweeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with \nefavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of \nrash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is \nrestarted. \n\n\n\n25\n\nExperience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class \nis limited. Reported rates of recurrent rash following a switch from nevirapine to efavirenz therapy, \nprimarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18%, \ncomparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.) \n\nPsychiatric symptoms \n\nSerious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In \ncontrolled trials, the frequency of specific serious psychiatric events were: \n\nEfavirenz regimen \n(n=1,008)\n\nControl regimen \n(n=635)\n\n- severe depression 1.6% 0.6%\n- suicidal ideation 0.6% 0.3%\n- non-fatal suicide attempts 0.4% 0%\n- aggressive behaviour 0.4% 0.3%\n- paranoid reactions 0.4% 0.3%\n- manic reactions 0.1% 0%\n\nPatients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric \nadverse reactions with frequencies ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe \ndepression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of death by suicide, \ndelusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. \n\nNervous system symptoms \n\nIn clinical controlled trials, frequently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to \ndizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system \nsymptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients compared \nto 9% (severe 1%) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2% of patients treated \nwith efavirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. \n\nNervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally \nresolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of uninfected volunteers, a representative nervous system \nsymptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous \nsystem symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals \npossibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to \nimprove the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy \nand in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or \nsplitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit. \n\nAnalysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset \nnervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the \ncontrol arm. \n\nHepatic failure \n\nA few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing \nhepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing \nin some cases to transplantation or death.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\n\n\n26\n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n\nLaboratory test abnormalities \n\nLiver enzymes: elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-\nterm treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens \n(5% after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in \n4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control \nregimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term \ntreatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. \nIn the long-term study (006), 1% of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or \nbiliary system disorders. \n\nAmylase: in the clinical trial subset of 1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels \ngreater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz \nand 6% of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical significance of asymptomatic increases \nin serum amylase is unknown. \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nUndesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of adult patients. Rash was reported \nmore frequently in children (59 of 182 (32%) treated with efavirenz) and was more often of higher \ngrade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 6 of 182 (3.3%) of children). Prophylaxis with \nappropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered.. \n\nOther special populations \n\nLiver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients: in the long-term data set from study 006, \n137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and \n84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for \nhepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected \npatients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of \nefavirenz-treated patients and in 7% of controls, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN \ndeveloped in 20% and 7%, respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3% of those treated with \nefavirenz and 2% in the control arm discontinued because of liverdisorders (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n27\n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSome patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system \nsymptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. \n\nTreatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. Administration of activated \ncharcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for \noverdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove \nsignificant quantities of it from blood. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. ATC code: J05AG03 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nEfavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase (RT) and does not significantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases (α, β, γ or \nδ). \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nThe effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo \ncontrolled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects \nenriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 \ngenotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax \nobserved in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz \nconcentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the \nmean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in \nsubjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days \n(see section 4.5).\n\nAntiviral activity \n\nThe free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-\nresistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell \nlines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures. \n\nResistance \n\nThe potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions \n48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to \nthat observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest \nresistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 \n(L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold \nresistance). Greater than 100-fold loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing \nK103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT. \n\nK103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who \nexperienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with \nindinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90% of patients receiving \nefavirenz with virological failure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or \n\n\n\n28\n\n225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The \npattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to efavirenz was independent of \nthe other antiviral medicines used in combination with efavirenz. \n\nCross resistance \n\nCross resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the \nK103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-\nresistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N \nsubstitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of RT was not cross-resistant \nto efavirenz. \n\nViral isolates recovered from PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed \nevidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen \nisolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and \ndelavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-\nisoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates \ntested remained sensitive to efavirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and \ndelavirdine. \n\nThe potential for cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme \ntargets involved. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the \ndifferent binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nEfavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely \nwith CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or in PI or NNRTI experienced patients. Clinical experience in \ncontrolled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited. \n\nTwo controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in \ncombination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of \nquantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-\nexperienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients \nover 24 weeks. In these studies the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir was \n1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without \nefavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs \ngiven every 12 hours were used in each of these studies. \n\nStudy 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or \nefavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to \nbe efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count \nwas 341 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/ml. Efficacy results for \nstudy 006 on a subset of 614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 3. \nIn the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who \nterminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was \neither preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered \nto have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ml at the missing time points. \n\n\n\n29\n\nTable 3: Efficacy results for study 006 \n\nResponder rates (NC = Fa) \nPlasma HIV-RNA \n\nMean change \nfrom \n\nbaseline-CD4 \ncell count\n\n< 400 copies/ml  \n(95% C.I.b)\n\n< 50 copies/ml  \n(95% C.I.b)\n\ncells/mm3 \n\n(S.E.M.c)\nTreatment \nRegimend\n\nn 48 weeks 48 weeks 48 weeks \n\nEFV + \nZDV + 3TC\n\n202 67% \n(60%, 73%)\n\n62% \n(55%, 69%)\n\n187 \n(11.8)\n\nEFV + IDV 206 54% \n(47%, 61%)\n\n48% \n(41%, 55%)\n\n177 \n(11.3)\n\nIDV + \nZDV + 3TC\n\n206 45% \n(38%, 52%)\n\n40% \n(34%, 47%)\n\n153 \n(12.3)\n\na NC = F, noncompleter = failure. \nb C.I., confidence interval. \nc S.E.M., standard error of the mean. \nd EFV, efavirenz; ZDV, zidovudine; 3TC, lamivudine; IDV, indinavir. \n\nLong-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with \nEFV+IDV, 196 patients with EFV+ZDV+3TC and 127 patients with IDV+ZDV+3TC, respectively), \nsuggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml, \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.  \n\nEfficacy results for studies ACTG 364 and 020 are found in Table 4.

Thirty-seven patients 3 months to 6 years of age (median 0.7 \nyears) were treated with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.88 log10\ncopies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 1144 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 25%. The \nmedian time on study therapy was 132 weeks; 27% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an \nITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at \nWeek 48 were 57% (21/37) and 46% (17/37), respectively. The median increase from baseline in \nCD4+ count at 48 weeks was 215 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 6%. \n\nStudy PACTG 1021 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and \nantiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in paediatric patients \nwho were antiretroviral therapy naive. Forty-three patients 3 months to 21 years of age (median \n9.6 years) were dosed with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was \n4.8 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 367 cells/mm\n\n3, and median CD4+ percentage was \n18%. The median time on study therapy was 181 weeks; 16% of patients discontinued before Week \n48. Using an ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and \n<50 copies/mL at Week 48 were 77% (33/43) and 70% (30/43), respectively. The median increase \nfrom baseline in CD4+ count at 48 weeks of therapy was 238 cells/mm3 and the median increase in \nCD4+ percentage was 13%. \n\nStudy PACTG 382 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and \nantiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with nelfinavir and an NRTI in antiretroviral-naive and \nNRTI-experienced paediatric patients. One hundred two patients 3 months to 16 years of age (median \n5.7 years) were treated with SUSTIVA. Eighty-seven percent of patients had received prior \n\nantiretroviral therapy. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.57 log10 copies/mL, median \n\nCD4+ cell count was 755 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 30%. The median time on \nstudy therapy was 118 weeks; 25% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an ITT analysis, \nthe overall proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at Week 48 \nwere 57% (58/102) and 43% (44/102), respectively. The median increase from baseline in CD4+ count \n\nat 48 weeks of therapy was 128 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 5%.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \n\nPeak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral \ndoses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and \nAUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting \ndiminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not \nchange following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days. \n\nIn HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with \n200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady \nstate Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 μM (29%) [mean ± S.D. (% C.V.)], steady state Cmin was \n5.6 ± 3.2 μM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM·h (40%). \n\nEffect of food \n\nThe bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz hard capsules in uninfected volunteers was \nincreased 22% and 17%, respectively, when given with a meal of high fat or normal composition, \nrelative to the bioavailability of a 600 mg dose given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).\n\nBioavailability of hard capsule contents mixed with food vehicles \n\n\n\n31\n\nIn healthy adult subjects, the efavirenz AUC when administered as the contents of three 200 mg hard \ncapsules mixed with 2 teaspoons of certain food vehicles (applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt or infant \nformula) met bioequivalency criteria for the AUC of the intact capsule formulation administered under \nfasted conditions. \n\nDistribution \n\nEfavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly \nalbumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at \nleast one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean 0.69%) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-\nprotein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that \nefavirenz is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with \nsubsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially \ninactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major \nisozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and \n3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at \nconcentrations well above those achieved clinically. \n\nEfavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant \nof the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, \nthe potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be \nexcluded. \n\nEfavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own \nmetabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple \ndoses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation \n(22 - 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see \nbelow). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 \nsubstrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, table 2). \nAlthough in vitro data suggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been \ncontradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when \ncoadministered with efavirenz in vivo. The net effect of coadministration is not clear. \n\nElimination \n\nEfavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses and 40 -\n 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was \nrecovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a single-dose study, half life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. A multiple-\ndose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insufficient data to determine \nwhether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz \npharmacokinetics. \n\nGender, race, elderly \n\n\n\n32\n\nAlthough limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have \nhigher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic \nstudies have not been performed in the elderly. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters for efavirenz at steady state in paediatric patients were predicted by a \npopulation pharmacokinetic model and are summarized in Table 5 by weight ranges that correspond to \nthe recommended doses. \n\nTable 5: Predicted steady-state pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (capsules/capsule sprinkles) in \nHIV-infected paediatric patients \n\nBody Weight Dose Mean AUC(0-24) \nµM·h\n\nMean Cmax \nµg/mL\n\nMean Cmin \nµg/mL\n\n3.5-5 kg 100 mg 220.52 5.81 2.43\n5-7.5 kg 150 mg 262.62 7.07 2.71\n7.5-10 kg 200 mg 284.28 7.75 2.87\n10-15 kg 200 mg 238.14 6.54 2.32\n15-20 kg 250 mg 233.98 6.47 2.3\n20-25 kg 300 mg 257.56 7.04 2.55\n\n25-32.5 kg 350 mg 262.37 7.12 2.68\n32.5-40 kg 400 mg 259.79 6.96 2.69\n\n>40 kg 600 mg 254.78 6.57 2.82\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEfavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n\nEfavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/ \nnewborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz \nconcentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with \nsecondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microophthalmia was observed in \nanother foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. No malformations were observed in \nfoetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. \n\nBiliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose \nresulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the \nrecommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has \nbeen observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz \nfor ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the \nrecommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nCarcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female \nmice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for \nhumans are not known. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic \npotential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efavirenz outweighs the \npotential carcinogenic risk to humans. \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\nSUSTIVA 600 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz. \n\nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 249.6 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\nDark yellow, capsule-shaped, printed with “SUSTIVA” on both sides.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nSUSTIVA is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-\n1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and weighing at least 3.5 kg. \n\nSUSTIVA has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients \nwith CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or after failure of protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. \nAlthough cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present \ninsufficient data on the efficacy of subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of \nregimens containing SUSTIVA. \n\nFor a summary of clinical and pharmacodynamic information, see section 5.1. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n\nPosology \n\nEfavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5). \n\nIn order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is \nrecommended (see section 4.8). \n\nAdults and adolescents over 40 kg\n\nThe recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 600 mg orally, once daily. \n\nEfavirenz film-coated tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. Efavirenz hard \ncapsules are available for these patients. \n\n\n\n36\n\nDose adjustment \n\nIf efavirenz is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be \nincreased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose must be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg \nonce daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be \nrestored (see section 4.5). \n\nIf efavirenz is coadministered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the \ndose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5). \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, \nless than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal \nimpairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4). \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nPatients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. \nPatients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system \nsymptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of 3 months or weighing less than \n3.5 kg have not been established. No data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nIt is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach. The increased efavirenz \nconcentrations observed following administration of efavirenz with food may lead to an increase in \nfrequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2). \n\nCo-administraion with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or \nergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) \nbecause competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the \npotential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, \nprolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5). \n\nCo-administration with elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) due to the potential for significant \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of EBR and GZR (see section 4.5). \n\nHerbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased \nplasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). \n\nPatients with: \n- a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on \nelectrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. \n\n\n\n37\n\n- a history of symptomatic cardiac arrythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with \ncongestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. \n- severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. \n\nPatients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval (proarrythmic).  \nThese drugs include: \n\n- antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, \n- neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, \n- certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, \n\nimidazole and triazole antifungal agents, \n- certain non-sedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), \n- cisapride, \n- flecainide, \n- certain antimalarials,   \n\n- methadone. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nEfavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a failing \nregimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice \nof new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration \nthe potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1). \n\nCo-administration of efavirenz with the fixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with \nrifampicin). \n\nCoadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nConcomitant administration of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir/ voxilaprevir with efavirenz is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n\nCoadministration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma \nconcentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Coadministration \nof glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nConcomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\nWhen prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should refer to the \ncorresponding Summary of Product Characteristics. \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n\nIf any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected \nintolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of all antiretroviral \nmedicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon \nresolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of \nantiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential for selection of resistant virus. \n\nRash\n\nMild -to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with \ncontinued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and \nhasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration \nhas been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of erythema \n\n\n\n38\n\nmultiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. Efavirenz must be discontinued in \npatients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or \nfever. If therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting \ntherapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8). \n\nExperience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class \nis limited (see section 4.8). Efavirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening \ncutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI. \n\nPsychiatric symptoms \n\nPsychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a \nprior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse \nreactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, \npsychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms \nsuch as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately \nto assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to \ndetermine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8). \n\nNervous system symptoms\n\nSymptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and \nabnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg \ndaily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one \nor two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed \nthat if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are \nnot predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. \n\nSeizures \n\nConvulsions have been observed in adult and paediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the \npresence of known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant \nmedicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and \nphenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, \ncarbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with \nefavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. \n\nHepatic events \n\nA few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic \ndisease or other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be \nconsidered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. \n\nQTc Prolongation \n\nQTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  \n\nConsider alternatives to efavirenz for coadministration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de \nPointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.  \n\nEffect of food \n\nThe administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may \nlead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \nefavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. \n\n\n\n39\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the \nsetting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases \nevidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any \nparticular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV \ntreatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nLiver disease\n\nEfavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and \nnot recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to \ndetermine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated \nmetabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution \nmust be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should \nbe monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. \nLaboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see \nsection 4.2). \n\nThe safety and efficacy of efavirenz has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with \npre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver \nfunction abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to \nstandard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum \ntransaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued \ntherapy with efavirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8).  \n\nIn patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver \nenzymes is also recommended. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please \nrefer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n\n\n\n40\n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, \nless than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal \nimpairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in \npatients with severe renal failure and close safety monitoring is recommended in this population. \n\nElderly patients\n\nInsufficient numbers of elderly patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether \nthey respond differently than younger patients. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nEfavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 months of age or who weigh less than 3.5 kg. \nTherefore, efavirenz should not be given to children less than 3 months of age. Efavirenz film-coated \ntablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. \n\nRash was reported in 59 of 182 children (32%) treated with efavirenz and was severe in six patients. \nProphylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may \nbe considered. \n\nLactose \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nEfavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of \nthese enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In \nvitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially \nincrease the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with \nnarrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; \nhowever, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with \nsubstrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2). \n\nEfavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or \nfood (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or \nherbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these \nenzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s \nwort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\nQT Prolonging Drugs \n\nEfavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval \nand Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant \nagents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides,  \nfluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics \n(terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\nContraindications of concomitant use \n\n\n\n41\n\nEfavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, \ntriazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-\nthreatening events (see section 4.3). \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir \n\nConcomitant administration of efavirenz with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may \nlead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir. This loss is due to significant decreases in \nelbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3). \n\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\n\nCo-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is \ncontraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due \nto induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is \nalready taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. \nEfavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need \nadjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of \ntreatment (see section 4.3). \n\nOther interactions \n\nInteractions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease \ninhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “q8h” or \n“q12h”). If available, 90% or 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were \nconducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.  \n\nTable 1: Interactions between efavirenz and other medicinal products in adults \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, \n\nCmin with confidence intervals if \navailablea \n\n(mechanism) \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nefavirenz \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nHIV antivirals \nProtease inhibitors (PI) \nAtazanavir/ ritonavir/Efavirenz \n(400 mg once daily/100 mg once \ndaily/600 mg once daily, all \nadministered with food) \n\nAtazanavir (pm): \nAUC: ↔* (↓9 to ↑10) \nCmax: ↑17%* (↑8 to ↑27)\nCmin: ↓42%* (↓31 to ↓51) \n\nCo-administration of efavirenz \nwith atazanavir/ritonavir is not \nrecommended.

False-positive urine cannabinoid \ntest results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects \nreceiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass \nspectrometry is recommended in such cases. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nSee below and section 5.3. Efavirenz should not be used during pregnancy, unless the patient’s clinical \ncondition requires such treatment. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing \nbefore initiation of efavirenz.  \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nBarrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for \nexample, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-life of \nefavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is \nrecommended.  \n\nPregnancy \n\n\n\n54\n\nThere have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including \nmeningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-\ncontaining fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective \nand 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with the \nfixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. \nA causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the \ndenominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development \n(at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. \n\nAs of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 \npregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. \nOne child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth \ndefects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as well as \nthose in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges \nfrom 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births. \n\nMalformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3). \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nEfavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of efavirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the infant can not be excluded. Breast-feeding should \nbe discontinued during treatment with SUSTIVA. It is recommended that HIV infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n\nFertility \n\nThe effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that \nachieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given \nrecommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male \nor female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid), and did not affect sperm or offspring of treated male rats \n(doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given \nefavirenz was not affected.  \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nEfavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be \ninstructed that if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such \nas driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEfavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received \n600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients \nwere rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%). The most \nnotable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. Nervous \nsystem symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 \nweeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric \nadverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and \nseizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. The administration of efavirenz with \nfood may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse \nreactions (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n55\n\nThe long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) \nin which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration \n180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + \nlamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not \nassociated with any new safety concerns. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions of moderate or greater severity with at least possible relationship to treatment \nregimen (based on investigator attribution) reported in clinical trials of efavirenz at the recommended \ndose in combination therapy (n = 1,008) are listed below. Also listed in italics are adverse reactions \nobserved post-marketing in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens. \nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); or very rare (< 1/10,000). \n\nImmune system disorders \nuncommon hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \ncommon hypertriglyceridaemia* \n\nuncommon hypercholesterolaemia* \n\nPsychiatric disorders\ncommon abnormal dreams, anxiety, depression, \n\ninsomnia* \n\nuncommon affect lability, aggression, confusional state, \neuphoric mood, hallucination, mania, \nparanoia, psychosis†, suicide attempt, suicide \nideation, catatonia* \n\nrare delusion ‡, neurosis ‡, completed suicide‡,*\nNervous system disorders \ncommon  cerebellar coordination and balance \n\ndisturbances†, disturbance in attention \n(3.6%), dizziness (8.5%), headache (5.7%), \nsomnolence (2.0%)* \n\nuncommon agitation, amnesia, ataxia, coordination \nabnormal, convulsions, thinking abnormal,* \ntremor†\n\nEye disorders\nuncommon vision blurred \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nuncommon tinnitus†, vertigo \n\nVascular disorders\nuncommon flushing†\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\ncommon abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\nuncommon pancreatitis \n\n\n\n56\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\ncommon aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \n\nincreased*, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nincreased*, gamma-glutamyltransferase \n(GGT) increased* \n\nuncommon hepatitis acute \n\nrare  hepatic failure‡,* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nvery common rash (11.6%)* \n\ncommon pruritus \n\nuncommon erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome* \n\nrare photoallergic dermatitis†\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nuncommon gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\ncommon Fatigue \n\n*,†,‡ See section Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nInformation regarding post-marketing surveillance \n\n†These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance; however, the \nfrequencies were determined using data from 16 clinical trials (n=3,969).  \n\n‡These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance but not reported as drug-\nrelated events for efavirenz-treated patients in 16 clinical trials. The frequency category of \"rare\" was \ndefined per A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (rev. 2, Sept 2009) on the \nbasis of an estimated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 0 events given the number of \npatients treated with efavirenz in these clinical trials (n=3,969). \n\nRash\n\nIn clinical studies, 26% of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared \nwith 17% of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18% of \npatients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz, \nand 1.7% discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%. \n\nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two \nweeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with \nefavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of \nrash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is \nrestarted. \n\n\n\n57\n\nExperience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class \nis limited. Reported rates of recurrent rash following a switch from nevirapine to efavirenz therapy, \nprimarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18%, \ncomparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.) \n\nPsychiatric symptoms\n\nSerious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In \ncontrolled trials, the frequency of specific serious psychiatric events were: \n\nEfavirenz regimen \n(n=1,008)\n\nControl regimen \n(n=635)\n\n- severe depression 1.6% 0.6%\n- suicidal ideation 0.6% 0.3%\n- non-fatal suicide attempts 0.4% 0%\n- aggressive behaviour 0.4% 0.3%\n- paranoid reactions 0.4% 0.3%\n- manic reactions 0.1% 0%\n\nPatients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric \nadverse reactions with frequencies ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe \ndepression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of death by suicide, \ndelusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. \n\nNervous system symptoms\n\nIn clinical controlled trials, frequently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to \ndizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system \nsymptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients compared \nto 9% (severe 1%) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2% of patients treated \nwith efavirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. \n\nNervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally \nresolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of uninfected volunteers, a representative nervous system \nsymptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous \nsystem symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals \npossibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to \nimprove the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy \nand in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or \nsplitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit. \n\nAnalysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset \nnervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the \ncontrol arm. \n\nHepatic failure \n\nA few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing \nhepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing \nin some cases to transplantation or death.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\n\n\n58\n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n\nLaboratory test abnormalities \n\nLiver enzymes: elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-\nterm treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens \n(5% after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in \n4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control \nregimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term \ntreatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. \nIn the long-term study (006), 1% of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or \nbiliary system disorders. \n\nAmylase: in the clinical trial subset of 1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels \ngreater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz \nand 6% of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical significance of asymptomatic increases \nin serum amylase is unknown. \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nUndesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of adult patients. Rash was reported \nmore frequently in children (59 of 182 (32%) treated with efavirenz) and was more often of higher \ngrade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 6 of 182 (3.3%) of children). Prophylaxis with \nappropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered. .  \n\nOther special populations \n\nLiver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients: in the long-term data set from study 006, \n137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and \n84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for \nhepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected \npatients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of \nefavirenz-treated patients and in 7% of control, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN \ndeveloped in 20% and 7%, respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3% of those treated with \nefavirenz and 2% in the control arm discontinued because of liver disorders (see section 4.4). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n59\n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSome patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system \nsymptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. \n\nTreatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. Administration of activated \ncharcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for \noverdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove \nsignificant quantities of it from blood. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. ATC code: J05AG03 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nEfavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase (RT) and does not significantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases (α, β, γ or \nδ). \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nThe effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo \ncontrolled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects \nenriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 \ngenotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax \nobserved in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz \nconcentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the \nmean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in \nsubjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days \n(see section 4.5).\n\nAntiviral activity \n\nThe free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-\nresistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell \nlines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures. \n\nResistance \n\nThe potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions \n48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to \nthat observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest \nresistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 \n(L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold \nresistance). Greater than 100-fold loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing \nK103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT. \n\nK103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who \nexperienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with \nindinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90% of patients receiving \nefavirenz with virological failure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or \n\n\n\n60\n\n225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The \npattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to efavirenz was independent of \nthe other antiviral medicines used in combination with efavirenz. \n\nCross resistance \n\nCross resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the \nK103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-\nresistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N \nsubstitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of RT was not cross-resistant \nto efavirenz. \n\nViral isolates recovered from PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed \nevidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen \nisolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and \ndelavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-\nisoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates \ntested remained sensitive to efavirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and \ndelavirdine. \n\nThe potential for cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme \ntargets involved. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the \ndifferent binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nEfavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely \nwith CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3, or in PI or NNRTI experienced patients. Clinical experience in \ncontrolled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited. \n\nTwo controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in \ncombination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of \nquantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-\nexperienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients \nover 24 weeks. In these studies the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir was \n1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without \nefavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs \ngiven every 12 hours were used in each of these studies. \n\nStudy 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz \n+ indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be \nefavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was \n341 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/ml. Efficacy results for study \n006 on a subset of 614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 2. In \nthe analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who \nterminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was \neither preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered \nto have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ml at the missing time points. \n\n\n\n61\n\nTable 2: Efficacy results for study 006 \n\nResponder rates (NC = Fa) \nPlasma HIV-RNA \n\nMean change \nfrom \n\nbaseline-CD4 \ncell count\n\n< 400 copies/ml  \n(95% C.I.b)\n\n< 50 copies/ml  \n(95% C.I.b)\n\ncells/mm3 \n\n(S.E.M.c)\nTreatment \nRegimend\n\nn 48 weeks 48 weeks 48 weeks \n\nEFV + \nZDV + 3TC\n\n202 67% \n(60%, 73%)\n\n62% \n(55%, 69%)\n\n187 \n(11.8)\n\nEFV + IDV 206 54% \n(47%, 61%)\n\n48% \n(41%, 55%)\n\n177 \n(11.3)\n\nIDV + \nZDV + 3TC\n\n206 45% \n(38%, 52%)\n\n40% \n(34%, 47%)\n\n153 \n(12.3)\n\na NC = F, noncompleter = failure. \nb C.I., confidence interval. \nc S.E.M., standard error of the mean. \nd EFV, efavirenz; ZDV, zidovudine; 3TC, lamivudine; IDV, indinavir. \n\nLong-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with \nEFV+IDV, 196 patients with EFV+ZDV+3TC and 127 patients with IDV+ZDV+3TC, respectively), \nsuggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml, \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.  \n\nEfficacy results for studies ACTG 364 and 020 are found in Table 3.

Thirty-seven patients 3 months to 6 years of age (median 0.7 \nyears) were treated with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.88 log10\ncopies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 1144 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 25%. The \nmedian time on study therapy was 132 weeks; 27% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an \nITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at \nWeek 48 were 57% (21/37) and 46% (17/37), respectively. The median increase from baseline in \nCD4+ count at 48 weeks was 215 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 6%. \n\nStudy PACTG 1021 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and \nantiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with didanosine and emtricitabine in paediatric patients \nwho were antiretroviral therapy naive. Forty-three patients 3 months to 21 years of age (median \n9.6 years) were dosed with SUSTIVA. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was \n4.8 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 367 cells/mm\n\n3, and median CD4+ percentage was \n18%. The median time on study therapy was 181 weeks; 16% of patients discontinued before Week \n48. Using an ITT analysis, the overall proportions of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and \n<50 copies/mL at Week 48 were 77% (33/43) and 70% (30/43), respectively. The median increase \nfrom baseline in CD4+ count at 48 weeks of therapy was 238 cells/mm3 and the median increase in \nCD4+ percentage was 13%. \n\nStudy PACTG 382 was an open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and \nantiviral activity of SUSTIVA in combination with nelfinavir and an NRTI in antiretroviral-naive and \nNRTI-experienced paediatric patients. One hundred two patients 3 months to 16 years of age (median \n5.7 years) were treated with SUSTIVA. Eighty-seven percent of patients had received prior \n\nantiretroviral therapy. At baseline, median plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.57 log10 copies/mL, median \n\nCD4+ cell count was 755 cells/mm3, and median CD4+ percentage was 30%. The median time on \nstudy therapy was 118 weeks; 25% of patients discontinued before Week 48. Using an ITT analysis, \nthe overall proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL and <50 copies/mL at Week 48 \nwere 57% (58/102) and 43% (44/102), respectively. The median increase from baseline in CD4+ count \n\nat 48 weeks of therapy was 128 cells/mm3 and the median increase in CD4+ percentage was 5%.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \n\nPeak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral \ndoses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and \nAUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting \ndiminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not \nchange following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days. \n\nIn HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with \n200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady \nstate Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 μM (29%) [mean ± S.D. (% C.V.)], steady state Cmin was \n5.6 ± 3.2 μM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM·h (40%). \n\nEffect of food \n\nThe AUC and Cmax of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz film-coated tablets in uninfected volunteers \nwas increased by 28% (90% CI: 22-33%) and 79% (90% CI: 58-102%), respectively, when given with \na high fat meal, relative to when given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4). \n\nDistribution \n\n\n\n63\n\nEfavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly \nalbumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at \nleast one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean 0.69%) of the \ncorresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-\nprotein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz \nis principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with \nsubsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially \ninactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major \nisozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and \n3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at \nconcentrations well above those achieved clinically. \n\nEfavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant \nof the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, \nthe potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be \nexcluded. \n\nEfavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own \nmetabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple \ndoses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation \n(22 - 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see \nbelow). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 \nsubstrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, table 1). \nAlthough in vitro data suggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been \ncontradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when \ncoadministered with efavirenz in vivo. The net effect of coadministration is not clear. \n\nElimination \n\nEfavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses and 40 -\n 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was \nrecovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a single-dose study, half life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation.  A multiple-\ndose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls.  There were insufficient data to determine \nwhether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz \npharmacokinetics. \n\nGender, race, elderly \n\nAlthough limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have \nhigher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic \nstudies have not been performed in the elderly. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters for efavirenz at steady state in paediatric patients were predicted by a \npopulation pharmacokinetic model and are summarized in Table 4 by weight ranges that correspond to \nthe recommended doses. \n\n\n\n64\n\nTable 4: Predicted steady-state pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (capsules/capsule sprinkles) in \nHIV-infected paediatric patients \n\nBody Weight Dose Mean AUC(0-24) \nµM·h\n\nMean Cmax \nµg/mL\n\nMean Cmin \nµg/mL\n\n3.5-5 kg 100 mg 220.52 5.81 2.43\n5-7.5 kg 150 mg 262.62 7.07 2.71\n7.5-10 kg 200 mg 284.28 7.75 2.87\n10-15 kg 200 mg 238.14 6.54 2.32\n15-20 kg 250 mg 233.98 6.47 2.3\n20-25 kg 300 mg 257.56 7.04 2.55\n\n25-32.5 kg 350 mg 262.37 7.12 2.68\n32.5-40 kg 400 mg 259.79 6.96 2.69\n\n>40 kg 600 mg 254.78 6.57 2.82\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEfavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n\nEfavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/ \nnewborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz \nconcentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with \nsecondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microophthalmia was observed in \nanother foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. No malformations were observed in \nfoetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. \n\nBiliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose \nresulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the \nrecommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has \nbeen observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz \nfor ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the \nrecommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nCarcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female \nmice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for \nhumans are not known. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic \npotential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efavirenz outweighs the \npotential carcinogenic risk to humans. \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n86\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nSUSTIVA 50 mg hard capsules  \nefavirenz \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor,  pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What SUSTIVA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SUSTIVA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What SUSTIVA is and what it is used for \n\nSUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral \nmedicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of \nthe virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and \nweighing at least 3.5 kg.  \nYour doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. \nSUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in \nthe blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked \nto HIV infection.  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n\nDo not take SUSTIVA \n if you are allergic  to efavirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n if you have severe liver disease. \n\n if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heart beat, a slow \nheart beat, or severe heart disease.\n\n if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due to \na heart problem or was born with heart problems.  \n\n if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or \nmagnesium in your blood. \n\n if you are currently taking any of the following medicines (see also “Other medicines and \nSustiva”):  \n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergy symptoms)  \n\n\n\n87\n\n- bepridil (used to treat heart disease) \n- cisapride (used to treat heartburn) \n- ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and \n\nmethylergonovine) (used to treat migraine and cluster headaches) \n- midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) \n- pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental \n\nconditions) \n-  elbasvir or grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used for depression and \nanxiety) \n-  flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat) \n-  certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole)  \n- triazole antifungal agents \n- certain antimalarial treatments\n-  methadone (used to treat opiate addiction) \n\nIf you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these \nmedicines with SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-\neffects or stop SUSTIVA from working properly. \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA \n\n SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA \nis started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another \nmedicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. \n\n You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.  \n\n You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. \n \n Tell your doctor: \n\n- if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol \nabuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have \nstrange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n- if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with \nanticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are \ntaking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant \nmedicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your \ndoctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n- if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher \nrisk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct \nblood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another \nmedicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not \ntake SUSTIVA). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation \nof the QT interval. \n\n Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for: \n\n\n\n88\n\n- signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or \nabnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and \nusually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. \n\n- any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop \ntaking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another \nNNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. \n\n- any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation \nfrom previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed \nthat these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling \nthe body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start \ntaking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may \noccur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or \nother symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please \ninform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n- bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a \nbone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to \nthe bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be \nsome of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nSUSTIVA is not recommeded for children under the age of 3 months or weighing less than 3.5 kg \nbecause it has not been adequately studied in these patients. \n\nOther medicines and SUSTIVA \nYou must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nSUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. \nJohn’s wort) which can cause serious interactions. \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nSUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba\nextracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This \nmay stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\n Other medicines used for HIV infection: \n- protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted \n\natazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you \nan alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. \n\n- maraviroc \n- the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be \n\ntaken with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the \nactive ingredient of SUSTIVA. \n\n\n\n89\n\n Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, \nelbasvir/grazoprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\n\n Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related \nmycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider \nchanging your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may \nprescribe a higher dose of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): \n- voriconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and \n\nvoriconazole may increase the amount of SUSTIVA in your blood. If you take these two \nmedicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz \nmust be reduced. You must check with your doctor first. \n\n- itraconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. \n- posaconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat malaria: \n- artemether/lumefantrine:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine \n\nin your blood. \n- atovaquone/proguanil:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in \n\nyour blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital. SUSTIVA can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. \nCarbamazepine may make SUSTIVA less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider \ngiving you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. \nSUSTIVA can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your \ncholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. \n\n  Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an \nalternative treatment. \n\n Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of \nsertraline. \n\n Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may \nneed to change your dose of bupropion. \n\n  Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines \ntypically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking SUSTIVA, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. \n\n Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to \nprevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking SUSTIVA, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. \n\n Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for \nexample, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must \nalso use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy,breast-feeding and fertility). \nSUSTIVA may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in \nwomen taking SUSTIVA while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been \nestablished that the SUSTIVA therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. \n\n\n\n90\n\n Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may \nneed to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. \n\n Ginkgo biloba extracts (a herbal preparation) \n\n Medicines that impact heart rhythm:\n–  Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems: such as flecainide or metoprolol. \n– Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine \n– Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole. \n\nSUSTIVA with food and drink \nTaking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefuit juice should be \navoided when taking SUSTIVA. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nWomen should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. \nYour doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting \ntreatment with SUSTIVA.  \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or \nother hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood \nfor a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as \nabove, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are \npregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\nSerious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with \nefavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during \npregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic \ntests to monitor the development of your child. \n\nYou should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. \n\nDriving and using machines \nSUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.\nIf you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.  \n\nSUSTIVA contains lactose in each 600-mg daily dose. \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.  \n\n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing.  \n\n The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily. \n The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain \n\nmedicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA).  \n\n\n\n91\n\n SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach \npreferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) \nless troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a \nmeal.  \n\n It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water. \n SUSTIVA must be taken every day. \n SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in \n\ncombination with other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n SUSTIVA 50 mg hard capsules can be taken by children and adolescents 3 months of age and \n\nolder and weighing at least 3.5 kg who are able to swallow the capsules. Opening the capsule \nand taking the contents with a small amount of food may be considered for children who cannot \nswallow the hard capsule. \n\n The dose for children and adolescents is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily as \nshown below: \n\nBody Weight SUSTIVA Number of Capsules or \nTablets and Strength to \n\nAdminister\nkg Dose (mg) \n\n3.5 to < 5 100 one 100 mg capsule\n\n5 to < 7.5 150 one 100 mg capsule + one \n50 mg capsule \n\n7.5 to < 15 200 one 200 mg capsule \n15 to < 20 250 one 200 mg capsule + one \n\n50 mg capsule\n20 to < 25 300 three 100 mg capsules\n\n25 to < 32.5 350 three 100 mg capsules + \none 50 mg capsule\n\n32.5 to < 40 400 two 200 mg capsules\n≥ 40 600 one 600 mg tablet OR \n\nthree 200 mg capsules\n\nFor children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard \ncapsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The \ncapsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the \ncapsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small \ncontainer for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes \nafter mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. \nAdd another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, \nstirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full \namount again. The child should not be given any additional food for 2 hours. The doctor may also \nrecommend this method of taking SUSTIVA for adults who cannot swallow capsules. \n\nInstructions for capsule sprinkle method: \n\n1 Avoid giving the daily SUSTIVA dose within 1 hour after a feeding or meal.\n2 Wash and dry your hands before and after preparing the capsule sprinkle.\n3 Choose a soft food the child likes. Examples of soft foods are applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt, \n\nor infant formula. In a taste preference study in adults, SUSTIVA mixed with grape jelly \nreceived the best rating.\n\n\n\n92\n\n4 Place 1-2 teaspoons of the food in a small container (illustration a). \n\n5 SUSTIVA capsules must be opened carefully over the food container, as described in steps \n6-7, so that the contents do not spill.\n\n6 With your hands over the container, hold the capsule with the cap \nfacing up (see illustration b). \n\n7 Carefully pull the cap away from the body of the capsule \n(illustration c). \n\n8 Sprinkle the contents of the capsule on the food (illustration d). \n\n9 If the daily dose consists of more than one capsule, follow steps 5-8 for each capsule. Do not\nadd more food.\n\n10 Mix the capsule contents and food together (illustration e). \n\nSteps 11-14 must be completed within 30 minutes of mixing:\n11 Give the mixture of food and capsule contents to the child, making \n\nsure he or she eats the full amount (illustration f). \n\n12 Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing \ncontainer (illustration a).\n\n13 Stir to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container (illustration e).\n14 Have the child eat the full amount again (illustration f).\n15 Do not give the child any additional food for 2 hours.\n\nIf you take more SUSTIVA than you should \nIf you take too much SUSTIVA contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. \nKeep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n\nIf you forget to take SUSTIVA \nTry not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your \nmedicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n93\n\nIf you stop taking SUSTIVA \nWhen your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time. The virus may then become harder to treat. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \nWhen treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nThe most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms. \n\nYou should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most \ncases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more \ncommon in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. \n\nThe nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in \nthe first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours \nafter taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime \nand on an empty stomach.

What SUSTIVA is and what it is used for \n\nSUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral \nmedicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of \nthe virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and \nweighing at least 3.5 kg.  \nYour doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. \nSUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in \nthe blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked \nto HIV infection.  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n\nDo not take SUSTIVA \n if you are allergic  to efavirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n  if you have severe liver disease. \n\n     if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heart beat, a \nslow heart beat, or severe heart disease.\n\n     if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due \n\nto a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  \n\n     if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or \n\nmagnesium in your blood. \n\n if you are currently taking any of the following medicines(see also “Other medicines and \nSustiva”):  \n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergy symptoms)  \n\n\n\n99\n\n- bepridil (used to treat heart disease) \n- cisapride (used to treat heartburn) \n- ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and \n\nmethylergonovine) (used to treat migraine and cluster headaches) \n- midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) \n- pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental \n\nconditions) \n- elbasvir or grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used for depression and \nanxiety) \n-  flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat) \n-  certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole)  \n- triazole antifungal agents\n- certain antimalarial treatments\n-  methadone (used to treat opiate addiction) \n\nIf you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these \nmedicines with SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-\neffects or stop SUSTIVA from working properly. \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA \n\n SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA \nis started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another \nmedicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. \n\n You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.  \n\n You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. \n \n Tell your doctor: \n\n- if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol \nabuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have \nstrange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n- if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with \nanticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are \ntaking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant \nmedicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your \ndoctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n- if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher \nrisk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct \nblood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another \nmedicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not \ntake SUSTIVA). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation \nof the QT interval. \n\n\n\n100\n\n Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for: \n\n- signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or \nabnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and \nusually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. \n\n- any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop \ntaking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another \nNNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. \n\n- any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation \nfrom previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed \nthat these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling \nthe body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start \ntaking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may \noccur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or \nother symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please \ninform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n- bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a \nbone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to \nthe bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be \nsome of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nSUSTIVA is not recommeded for children under the age of 3 months or weighing less than 3.5 kg \nbecause it has not been adequately studied in these patients. \n\nOther medicines and SUSTIVA \nYou must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nSUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. \nJohn’s wort) which can cause serious interactions. \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nSUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba\nextracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This \nmay stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\n Other medicines used for HIV infection: \n- protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted \n\natazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you \nan alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. \n\n- maraviroc \n\n\n\n101\n\n- the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be \ntaken with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the \nactive ingredient of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, \nelbasvir/grazoprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\n\n Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related \nmycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider \nchanging your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may \nprescribe a higher dose of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): \n- voriconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and \n\nvoriconazole may increase the amount of SUSTIVA in your blood. If you take these two \nmedicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz \nmust be reduced. You must check with your doctor first. \n\n- itraconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. \n- posaconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat malaria: \n- artemether/lumefantrine:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine \n\nin your blood. \n- atovaquone/proguanil:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in \n\nyour blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital. SUSTIVA can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. \nCarbamazepine may make SUSTIVA less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider \ngiving you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. \nSUSTIVA can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your \ncholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. \n\n  Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an \nalternative treatment. \n\n Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of \nsertraline. \n\n Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may \nneed to change your dose of bupropion. \n\n  Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines \ntypically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking SUSTIVA, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. \n\n Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to \nprevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking SUSTIVA, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. \n\n Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for \nexample, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must \nalso use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy,breast-feeding and fertility). \nSUSTIVA may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in \n\n\n\n102\n\nwomen taking SUSTIVA while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been \nestablished that the SUSTIVA therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. \n\n Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may \nneed to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. \n\n Ginkgo biloba extracts (a herbal preparation) \n\n    Medicines that impact heart rhythm:\n-  Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as flecainide or metoprolol. \n\n-     Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine. \n\n-    Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole. \n\nSUSTIVA with food and drink \nTaking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefuit juice should be \navoided when taking SUSTIVA. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nWomen should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. \nYour doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting \ntreatment with SUSTIVA.  \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or \nother hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood \nfor a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as \nabove, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are \npregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\nSerious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with \nefavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during \npregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic \ntests to monitor the development of your child. \n\nYou should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. \n\nDriving and using machines \nSUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.\nIf you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.  \n\nSUSTIVA contains lactose in each 600-mg daily dose. \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.  \n\n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing.  \n\n\n\n103\n\n The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily. \n The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain \n\nmedicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA).  \n SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach \n\npreferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) \nless troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a \nmeal.  \n\n It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water. \n SUSTIVA must be taken every day. \n SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in \n\ncombination with other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n SUSTIVA 100 mg hard capsules can be taken by children and adolescents 3 months of age and \n\nolder and weighing at least 3.5 kg who are able to swallow the capsules. Opening the capsule \nand taking the contents with a small amount of food may be considered for children who cannot \nswallow the hard capsule. \n\n The dose for children and adolescents is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily as \nshown below: \n\nBody Weight SUSTIVA Number of Capsules or \nTablets and Strength to \n\nAdminister\nkg Dose (mg) \n\n3.5 to < 5 100 one 100 mg capsule\n\n5 to < 7.5 150 one 100 mg capsule + one \n50 mg capsule \n\n7.5 to < 15 200 one 200 mg capsule \n15 to < 20 250 one 200 mg capsule + one \n\n50 mg capsule\n20 to < 25 300 three 100 mg capsules\n\n25 to < 32.5 350 three 100 mg capsules + \none 50 mg capsule\n\n32.5 to < 40 400 two 200 mg capsules\n≥ 40 600 one 600 mg tablet OR \n\nthree 200 mg capsules\n\nFor children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard \ncapsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The \ncapsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the \ncapsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small \ncontainer for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes \nafter mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. \nAdd another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, \nstirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full \namount again. The child should not be given any additional food for 2 hours. The doctor may also \nrecommend this method of taking SUSTIVA for adults who cannot swallow capsules. \n\nInstructions for capsule sprinkle method: \n\n1 Avoid giving the daily SUSTIVA dose within 1 hour after a feeding or meal.\n2 Wash and dry your hands before and after preparing the capsule sprinkle.\n3 Choose a soft food the child likes. Examples of soft foods are applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt, \n\nor infant formula. In a taste preference study in adults, SUSTIVA mixed with grape jelly \nreceived the best rating.\n\n\n\n104\n\n4 Place 1-2 teaspoons of the food in a small container (illustration a). \n\n5 SUSTIVA capsules must be opened carefully over the food container, as described in steps \n6-7, so that the contents do not spill.\n\n6 With your hands over the container, hold the capsule with the cap \nfacing up (see illustration b). \n\n7 Carefully pull the cap away from the body of the capsule \n(illustration c). \n\n8 Sprinkle the contents of the capsule on the food (illustration d). \n\n9 If the daily dose consists of more than one capsule, follow steps 5-8 for each capsule. Do not\nadd more food.\n\n10 Mix the capsule contents and food together (illustration e). \n\nSteps 11-14 must be completed within 30 minutes of mixing:\n11 Give the mixture of food and capsule contents to the child, making \n\nsure he or she eats the full amount (illustration f). \n\n12 Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing \ncontainer (illustration a).\n\n13 Stir to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container (illustration e).\n14 Have the child eat the full amount again (illustration f).\n15 Do not give the child any additional food for 2 hours.\n\nIf you take more SUSTIVA than you should \nIf you take too much SUSTIVA contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. \nKeep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n\nIf you forget to take SUSTIVA \nTry not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your \nmedicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n105\n\nIf you stop taking SUSTIVA \nWhen your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time. The virus may then become harder to treat. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \nWhen treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nThe most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms. \n\nYou should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most \ncases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more \ncommon in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. \n\nThe nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in \nthe first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours \nafter taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime \nand on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the \nability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur \nmore often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if \nyou have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. \n\nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\n- skin rash \n\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\n- abnormal dreams, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, headache, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, \n\nproblems with coordination or balance \n- stomach pain, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting \n- itching \n- tiredness \n- feeling anxious, feeling depressed \nTests may show: \n- increased liver enzymes in the blood \n- increased trigycerides (fatty acids) in the blood \n\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\n- nervousness, forgetfulness,  confusion, fitting (seizures), abnormal thoughts \n- blurred vision \n- a feeling of spinning or tilting (vertigo) \n- pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n\n\n\n106\n\n- allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) that may cause severe skin reactions (erythema multiforme, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome) \n\n- yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the \nliver \n\n- breast enlargement in males \n- angry behaviour, mood being affected, seeing or hearing things that are not really there \n\n(hallucinations), mania (mental condition characterised by episodes of overactivity, elation or \nirritability), paranoia, suicidal thoughts, catatonia (condition in which the patient is rendered \nmotionless and speechless for a period) \n\n- whistling, ringing or other persistent noise in the ears \n- tremor (shaking) \n- flushing \nTests may show: \n- increased cholesterol in the blood \n\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\n- itchy rash caused by a reaction to sunlight \n- liver failure, in some cases leading to death or liver transplant, has occurred with efavirenz. \n\nMost cases occurred in patients who already had liver disease, but there have been a few reports \nin patients without any existing liver disease. \n\n- unexplained feelings of distress not associated with hallucinations, but it may be difficult to \nthink clearly or sensibly \n\n- suicide \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5.

What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SUSTIVA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What SUSTIVA is and what it is used for \n\nSUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral \nmedicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of \nthe virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and \nweighing at least 3.5 kg.  \nYour doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. \nSUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in \nthe blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked \nto HIV infection.  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n\nDo not take SUSTIVA \n if you are allergic  to efavirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n  if you have severe liver disease. \n\n     if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heart beat, a \n\nslow heart beat, or severe heart disease.\n\n    if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due \n\nto a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  \n\n    if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or \n\nmagnesium in your blood. \n\n if you are currently taking any of the following medicines (see also “Other medicines and \nSustiva”):  \n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergy symptoms)  \n\n\n\n111\n\n- bepridil (used to treat heart disease) \n- cisapride (used to treat heartburn) \n- ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and \n\nmethylergonovine) (used to treat migraine and cluster headaches) \n- midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) \n- pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental \n\nconditions) \n- elbasvir or grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety)  \n-  flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat) \n-  certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole)  \n- triazole antifungal agents\n- certain antimalarial treatments\n-  methadone (used to treat opiate addiction) \n\nIf you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these \nmedicines with SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-\neffects or stop SUSTIVA from working properly. \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA \n\n SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA \nis started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another \nmedicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. \n\n You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.  \n\n You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. \n \n Tell your doctor: \n\n- if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol \nabuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have \nstrange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n- if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with \nanticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are \ntaking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant \nmedicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your \ndoctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n- if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher \nrisk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct \nblood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another \nmedicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not \ntake SUSTIVA). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation \nof the QT interval. \n\n\n\n112\n\n Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for: \n\n- signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or \nabnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and \nusually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. \n\n- any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop \ntaking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another \nNNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. \n\n- any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation \nfrom previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed \nthat these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling \nthe body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start \ntaking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may \noccur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or \nother symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please \ninform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n- bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a \nbone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to \nthe bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be \nsome of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nSUSTIVA is not recommeded for children under the age of 3 months or weighing less than 3.5 kg \nbecause it has not been adequately studied in these patients. \n\nOther medicines and SUSTIVA \nYou must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nSUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. \nJohn’s wort) which can cause serious interactions. \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nSUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba\nextracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This \nmay stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\n Other medicines used for HIV infection: \n- protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted \n\natazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you \nan alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. \n\n- maraviroc \n\n\n\n113\n\n- the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be \ntaken with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the \nactive ingredient of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, \nelbasvir/grazoprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\n\n Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related \nmycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider \nchanging your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may \nprescribe a higher dose of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): \n- voriconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and \n\nvoriconazole may increase the amount of SUSTIVA in your blood. If you take these two \nmedicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz \nmust be reduced. You must check with your doctor first. \n\n- itraconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. \n- posaconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat malaria: \n- artemether/lumefantrine:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine \n\nin your blood. \n- atovaquone/proguanil:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in \n\nyour blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital. SUSTIVA can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. \nCarbamazepine may make SUSTIVA less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider \ngiving you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. \nSUSTIVA can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your \ncholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. \n\n  Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an \nalternative treatment. \n\n Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of \nsertraline. \n\n Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may \nneed to change your dose of bupropion. \n\n  Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines \ntypically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking SUSTIVA, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. \n\n Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to \nprevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking SUSTIVA, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. \n\n Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for \nexample, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must \nalso use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy,breast-feeding and fertility). \nSUSTIVA may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in \n\n\n\n114\n\nwomen taking SUSTIVA while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been \nestablished that the SUSTIVA therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. \n\n Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may \nneed to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. \n\n Ginkgo biloba extracts (a herbal preparation)\n\n     Medicines that impact heart rhythm:\n- Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as flecainide or metoprolol. \n\n-     Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine. \n\n-    Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole. \n\nSUSTIVA with food and drink \nTaking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefuit juice should be \navoided when taking SUSTIVA. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nWomen should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. \nYour doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting \ntreatment with SUSTIVA.  \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or \nother hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood \nfor a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as \nabove, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are \npregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\nSerious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with \nefavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during \npregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic \ntests to monitor the development of your child. \n\nYou should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. \n\nDriving and using machines \nSUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.\nIf you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.  \n\nSUSTIVA contains lactose in each 600-mg daily dose. \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.  \n\n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing.  \n\n\n\n115\n\n The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily. \n The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain \n\nmedicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA).  \n SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach \n\npreferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) \nless troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a \nmeal.  \n\n It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water. \n SUSTIVA must be taken every day. \n SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in \n\ncombination with other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n SUSTIVA 200 mg hard capsules can be taken by children and adolescents 3 months of age and \n\nolder and weighing at least 3.5 kg who are able to swallow the capsules. Opening the capsule \nand taking the contents with a small amount of food may be considered for children who cannot \nswallow the hard capsule. \n\n The dose for children and adolescents is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily as \nshown below: \n\nBody Weight SUSTIVA Number of Capsules or \nTablets and Strength to \n\nAdminister\nkg Dose (mg) \n\n3.5 to < 5 100 one 100 mg capsule\n\n5 to < 7.5 150 one 100 mg capsule + one \n50 mg capsule \n\n7.5 to < 15 200 one 200 mg capsule \n15 to < 20 250 one 200 mg capsule + one \n\n50 mg capsule\n20 to < 25 300 three 100 mg capsules\n\n25 to < 32.5 350 three 100 mg capsules + \none 50 mg capsule\n\n32.5 to < 40 400 two 200 mg capsules\n≥ 40 600 one 600 mg tablet OR \n\nthree 200 mg capsules\n\nFor children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard \ncapsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The \ncapsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the \ncapsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small \ncontainer for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes \nafter mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. \nAdd another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, \nstirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full \namount again. The child should not be given any additional food for 2 hours. The doctor may also \nrecommend this method of taking SUSTIVA for adults who cannot swallow capsules. \n\nInstructions for capsule sprinkle method: \n\n1 Avoid giving the daily SUSTIVA dose within 1 hour after a feeding or meal.\n2 Wash and dry your hands before and after preparing the capsule sprinkle.\n3 Choose a soft food the child likes. Examples of soft foods are applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt, \n\nor infant formula. In a taste preference study in adults, SUSTIVA mixed with grape jelly \nreceived the best rating.\n\n\n\n116\n\n4 Place 1-2 teaspoons of the food in a small container (illustration a). \n\n5 SUSTIVA capsules must be opened carefully over the food container, as described in steps \n6-7, so that the contents do not spill.\n\n6 With your hands over the container, hold the capsule with the cap \nfacing up (see illustration b). \n\n7 Carefully pull the cap away from the body of the capsule \n(illustration c). \n\n8 Sprinkle the contents of the capsule on the food (illustration d). \n\n9 If the daily dose consists of more than one capsule, follow steps 5-8 for each capsule. Do not\nadd more food.\n\n10 Mix the capsule contents and food together (illustration e). \n\nSteps 11-14 must be completed within 30 minutes of mixing:\n11 Give the mixture of food and capsule contents to the child, making \n\nsure he or she eats the full amount (illustration f). \n\n12 Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing \ncontainer (illustration a).\n\n13 Stir to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container (illustration e).\n14 Have the child eat the full amount again (illustration f).\n15 Do not give the child any additional food for 2 hours.\n\nIf you take more SUSTIVA than you should \nIf you take too much SUSTIVA contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. \nKeep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n\nIf you forget to take SUSTIVA \nTry not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your \nmedicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n117\n\nIf you stop taking SUSTIVA \nWhen your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time. The virus may then become harder to treat. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \nWhen treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nThe most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms. \n\nYou should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most \ncases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more \ncommon in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. \n\nThe nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in \nthe first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours \nafter taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime \nand on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the \nability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur \nmore often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if \nyou have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. \n\nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\n- skin rash \n\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\n- abnormal dreams, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, headache, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, \n\nproblems with coordination or balance \n- stomach pain, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting \n- itching \n- tiredness \n- feeling anxious, feeling depressed \nTests may show: \n- increased liver enzymes in the blood \n- increased trigycerides (fatty acids) in the blood \n\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\n- nervousness, forgetfulness,  confusion, fitting (seizures), abnormal thoughts \n- blurred vision \n- a feeling of spinning or tilting (vertigo) \n- pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n\n\n\n118\n\n- allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) that may cause severe skin reactions (erythema multiforme, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome) \n\n- yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the \nliver \n\n- breast enlargement in males \n- angry behaviour, mood being affected, seeing or hearing things that are not really there \n\n(hallucinations), mania (mental condition characterised by episodes of overactivity, elation or \nirritability), paranoia, suicidal thoughts, catatonia (condition in which the patient is rendered \nmotionless and speechless for a period) \n\n- whistling, ringing or other persistent noise in the ears \n- tremor (shaking) \n- flushing \nTests may show: \n- increased cholesterol in the blood \n\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\n- itchy rash caused by a reaction to sunlight \n- liver failure, in some cases leading to death or liver transplant, has occurred with efavirenz. \n\nMost cases occurred in patients who already had liver disease, but there have been a few reports \nin patients without any existing liver disease. \n\n- unexplained feelings of distress not associated with hallucinations, but it may be difficult to \nthink clearly or sensibly \n\n- suicide \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n5.

What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SUSTIVA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What SUSTIVA is and what it is used for \n\nSUSTIVA, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral \nmedicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection by reducing the amount of \nthe virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 months of age and older and \nweighing at least 3.5 kg.  \nYour doctor has prescribed SUSTIVA for you because you have HIV infection. \nSUSTIVA taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in \nthe blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked \nto HIV infection.  \n\n2. What you need to know before you take SUSTIVA \n\nDo not take SUSTIVA \n if you are allergic  to efavirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n if you have severe liver disease. \n\n     if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heart beat, a \nslow heart beat, or severe heart disease. \n\n if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due  \nto a heart problem or was born with heart problems.  \n\n     if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or \n\nmagnesium in your blood. \n\n if you are currently taking any of the following medicines (see also “Other medicines and \nSustiva”):  \n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergy symptoms)  \n\n\n\n123\n\n- bepridil (used to treat heart disease) \n- cisapride (used to treat heartburn) \n- ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and \n\nmethylergonovine) (used to treat migraine and cluster headaches) \n- midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) \n- pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental \n\nconditions) \n- elbasvir or grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used for depression and \n\nanxiety) \n-  flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat) \n-  certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole)  \n- triazole antifungal agents\n- certain antimalarial treatments\n-  methadone (used to treat opiate addiction) \n\nIf you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these medicines \nwith SUSTIVA could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-effects or stop  \nSUSTIVA from working properly. \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA \n\n SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA \nis started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another \nmedicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. \n\n You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.  \n\n You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. \n\n Tell your doctor: \n\n- if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol \nabuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have \nstrange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n- if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with \nanticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are \ntaking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant \nmedicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your \ndoctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n- if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher \nrisk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct \nblood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another \nmedicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not \ntake SUSTIVA). \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation \nof the QT interval. \n\n Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for: \n\n\n\n124\n\n- signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or \nabnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and \nusually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. \n\n- any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop \ntaking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another \nNNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. \n\n- any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation \nfrom previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed \nthat these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling \nthe body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.  \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start \ntaking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may \noccur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or \nother symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please \ninform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n- bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a \nbone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to \nthe bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be \nsome of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nSUSTIVA is not recommeded for children under the age of 3 months or weighing less than 3.5 kg \nbecause it has not been adequately studied in these patients \n\nOther medicines and SUSTIVA \nYou must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nSUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. \nJohn’s wort) which can cause serious interactions. \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nSUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba\nextracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This \nmay stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n\n Other medicines used for HIV infection: \n- protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted \n\natazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you \nan alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. \n\n- maraviroc \n- the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be \n\ntaken with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the \nactive ingredient of SUSTIVA. \n\n\n\n125\n\n Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, \nelbasvir/grazoprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\n\n Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related \nmycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider \nchanging your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may \nprescribe a higher dose of SUSTIVA. \n\n Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): \n- voriconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and \n\nvoriconazole may increase the amount of SUSTIVA in your blood. If you take these two \nmedicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz \nmust be reduced. You must check with your doctor first. \n\n- itraconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. \n- posaconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat malaria: \n- artemether/lumefantrine:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine \n\nin your blood. \n- atovaquone/proguanil:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in \n\nyour blood. \n\n Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital. SUSTIVA can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. \nCarbamazepine may make SUSTIVA less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider \ngiving you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. \nSUSTIVA can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your \ncholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. \n\n Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an \nalternative treatment. \n\n Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of \nsertraline. \n\n Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may \nneed to change your dose of bupropion. \n\n Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines \ntypically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking SUSTIVA, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. \n\n Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to \nprevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking SUSTIVA, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. \n\n Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for \nexample, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must \nalso use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy,breast-feeding and fertility). \nSUSTIVA may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in \nwomen taking SUSTIVA while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been \nestablished that the SUSTIVA therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. \n\n\n\n126\n\n Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may \nneed to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. \n\n Ginkgo biloba extracts (a herbal preparation)\n\n     Medicines that impact heart rhythm:\n-     Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as flecainide or metoprolol. \n\n-     Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine. \n\n-    Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole. \n\nSUSTIVA with food and drink \nTaking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefuit juice should be \navoided when taking SUSTIVA. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nWomen should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA and for 12 weeks thereafter. \nYour doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting \ntreatment with SUSTIVA.  \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or \nother hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood \nfor a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as \nabove, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.  \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are \npregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\nSerious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with \nefavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during \npregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, \nand tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic \ntests to monitor the development of your child.  \n\nYou should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. \n\nDriving and using machines \nSUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.\nIf you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.  \n\nSUSTIVA contains lactose in each 600-mg daily dose.  \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product.  \n\n3. How to take SUSTIVA \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing. \n\n The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily.  \n The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain \n\nmedicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA). \n\n\n\n127\n\n SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach \npreferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) \nless troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a \nmeal. \n\n It is recommended that the tablet be swallowed whole with water. \n SUSTIVA must be taken every day. \n SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in \n\ncombination with other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n SUSTIVA film-coated tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. \n The dose for children weighing 40 kg or more is 600 mg once daily. \n\nIf you take more SUSTIVA than you should \nIf you take too much SUSTIVA, contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. \nKeep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n\nIf you forget to take SUSTIVA \nTry not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your \nmedicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nIf you stop taking SUSTIVA \nWhen your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time. The virus may then become harder to treat. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \nWhen treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are \ncaused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease \nitself. \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nThe most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.  \n\nYou should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most \ncases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more \ncommon in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. \n\nThe nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in \nthe first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours \nafter taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime \nand on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the \nability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur \nmore often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if \nyou have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA. \n\nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\n\n\n128\n\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10)\n- skin rash \n\nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100)\n- abnormal dreams, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, headache, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, \n\nproblems with coordination or balance \n- stomach pain, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting \n- itching \n- tiredness \n- feeling anxious, feeling depressed \nTests may show: \n- increased liver enzymes in the blood \n- increased trigycerides (fatty acids) in the blood \n\nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000)\n- nervousness, forgetfulness,  confusion, fitting (seizures), abnormal thoughts \n- blurred vision \n- a feeling of spinning or tilting (vertigo) \n- pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n- allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) that may cause severe skin reactions (erythema multiforme, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome) \n- yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the \n\nliver \n- breast enlargement in males \n- angry behaviour, mood being affected, seeing or hearing things that are not really there \n\n(hallucinations), mania (mental condition characterised by episodes of overactivity, elation or \nirritability), paranoia, suicidal thoughts, catatonia (condition in which the patient is rendered \nmotionless and speechless for a period) \n\n whistling, ringing or other persistent noise in the ears \n tremor (shaking) \n- flushing \nTests may show: \n- increased cholesterol in the blood \n\nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000)\n- itchy rash caused by a reaction to sunlight \n- liver failure, in some cases leading to death or liver transplant, has occurred with efavirenz. \n\nMost cases occurred in patients who already had liver disease, but there have been a few reports \nin patients without any existing liver disease. \n\n- unexplained feelings of distress not associated with hallucinations, but it may be difficult to \nthink clearly or sensibly \n\n- suicide \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V.
