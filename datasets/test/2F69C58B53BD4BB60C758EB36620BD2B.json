CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nHormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer \n\nAfinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced \n\nbreast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic \n\nvisceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. \n\n \n\nNeuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin \n\nAfinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderately-differentiated \n\nneuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease. \n\n \n\nNeuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin \n\nAfinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or \n\nGrade 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with \n\nprogressive disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nRenal cell carcinoma \n\nAfinitor is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, whose disease \n\nhas progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted therapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Afinitor should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \n\nanticancer therapies. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nFor the different dose regimens Afinitor is available as 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg tablets. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 10 mg everolimus once daily. Treatment should continue as long as clinical \n\nbenefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but take the next prescribed dose as \n\nusual. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to adverse reactions \n\nManagement of severe and/or intolerable suspected adverse reactions may require dose reduction \n\nand/or temporary interruption of Afinitor therapy. For adverse reactions of Grade 1, dose adjustment is \n\nusually not required. If dose reduction is required, the recommended dose is 5 mg daily and must not \n\nbe lower than 5 mg daily. \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises the dose adjustment recommendations for specific adverse reactions (see also \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1 Afinitor dose adjustment recommendations \n\n \n\nAdverse reaction Severity1 Afinitor dose adjustment \n\nNon-infectious \n\npneumonitis \n\nGrade 2 Consider interruption of therapy until symptoms improve \n\nto Grade \uf0a31. \n\nRe-initiate treatment at 5 mg daily. \n\nDiscontinue treatment if failure to recover within 4 weeks. \n\n Grade 3 Interrupt treatment until symptoms resolve to Grade \uf0a31. \n\nConsider re-initiating treatment at 5 mg daily. If toxicity \n\nrecurs at Grade 3, consider discontinuation. \n\n Grade 4 Discontinue treatment. \n\nStomatitis Grade 2 Temporary dose interruption until recovery to Grade \uf0a31. \n\nRe-initiate treatment at same dose. \n\nIf stomatitis recurs at Grade 2, interrupt dose until \n\nrecovery to Grade \uf0a31.

Re-initiate treatment at 5 mg daily. \n\nFebrile neutropenia Grade 3 Temporary dose interruption until recovery to Grade \uf0a32 \n\n(\u22651.25x109/l) and no fever. \n\nRe-initiate treatment at 5 mg daily. \n\n Grade 4 Discontinue treatment. \n1 Grading based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \n\nEvents (CTCAE) v3.0 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients (\u226565 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\uf02d Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) \u2013 the recommended dose is 7.5 mg daily. \n\n\uf02d Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) \u2013 the recommended dose is 5 mg daily. \n\n\uf02d Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) \u2013 Afinitor is only recommended if the desired \nbenefit outweighs the risk. In this case, a dose of 2.5 mg daily must not be exceeded. \n\nDose adjustments should be made if a patient\u2019s hepatic (Child-Pugh) status changes during treatment \n\n(see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Afinitor in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nAfinitor should be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, consistently either with \n\nor without food (see section 5.2). Afinitor tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. \n\nThe tablets should not be chewed or crushed. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. \n\nNon-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) has been frequently reported in \n\npatients taking Afinitor (see section 4.8). Some cases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal \n\noutcome was observed. A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients \n\npresenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough \n\nor dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-medicinal causes have been excluded \n\nby means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii \n\n(carinii) pneumonia (PJP/PCP) should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of non-infectious \n\npneumonitis (see \u201cInfections\u201d below). Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or \n\nworsening respiratory symptoms. \n\n \n\nPatients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or \n\nno symptoms may continue Afinitor therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms are moderate \n\n(Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms \n\nresolve. \n\n \n\nFor patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, \n\nprophylaxis for PJP/PCP may be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nInfections \n\nEverolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral \n\nor protozoan infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens (see section 4.8). Localised \n\nand systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections \n\nsuch as aspergillosis, candidiasis or PJP/PCP and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B \n\nvirus, have been described in patients taking Afinitor. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. \n\nleading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally fatal. \n\n \n\nPhysicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Afinitor. Pre-existing \n\ninfections should be treated appropriately and should have resolved fully before starting treatment \n\nwith Afinitor. While taking Afinitor, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of \n\ninfection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation \n\nof Afinitor. \n\n \n\nIf a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, the Afinitor treatment should be promptly \n\nand permanently discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate antifungal therapy. \n\n \n\nCases of PJP/PCP, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received everolimus. \n\nPJP/PCP may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive \n\nagents. Prophylaxis for PJP/PCP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or \n\nother immunosuppressive agents are required. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nHypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, \n\ndyspnoea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without \n\nrespiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nStomatitis \n\nStomatitis, including mouth ulcerations and oral mucositis, is the most commonly reported adverse \n\nreaction in patients treated with Afinitor (see section 4.8). Stomatitis mostly occurs within the first \n\n8 weeks of treatment. A single-arm study in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with \n\nAfinitor plus exemestane suggested that an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution, administered as a \n\nmouthwash during the initial 8 weeks of treatment, may decrease the incidence and severity of \n\nstomatitis (see section 5.1). Management of stomatitis may therefore include prophylactic and/or \n\ntherapeutic use of topical treatments, such as an alcohol-free corticosteroid oral solution as a \n\nmouthwash. However products containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and thyme derivatives \n\nshould be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Monitoring for and treatment of fungal \n\ninfection is recommended, especially in patients being treated with steroid-based medicinal products. \n\nAntifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRenal failure events \n\nCases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in \n\npatients treated with Afinitor (see section 4.8). Renal function should be monitored particularly where \n\npatients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nLaboratory tests and monitoring \n\nRenal function \n\nElevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein or \n\nserum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nBlood glucose \n\nHyperglycaemia has been reported (see section 4.8). Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is \n\nrecommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter. More frequent \n\nmonitoring is recommended when Afinitor is co-administered with other medicinal products that may \n\ninduce hyperglycaemia. When possible optimal glycaemic control should be achieved before starting a \n\npatient on Afinitor. \n\n \n\nBlood lipids \n\nDyslipidaemia (including hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia) has been reported. \n\nMonitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically \n\nthereafter, as well as management with appropriate medical therapy, is recommended. \n\n \n\nHaematological parameters \n\nDecreased haemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets have been reported (see section 4.8). \n\nMonitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and \n\nperiodically thereafter. \n\n \n\nFunctional carcinoid tumours \n\nIn a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre trial in patients with functional carcinoid tumours, \n\nAfinitor plus depot octreotide was compared to placebo plus depot octreotide. The study did not meet \n\nthe primary efficacy endpoint (progression-free-survival [PFS]) and the overall survival (OS) interim \n\nanalysis numerically favoured the placebo plus depot octreotide arm. Therefore, the safety and \n\nefficacy of Afinitor in patients with functional carcinoid tumours have not been established. \n\n \n\nPrognostic factors in neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin \n\nIn patients with non-functional gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumours and good prognostic \n\nbaseline factors, e.g. ileum as primary tumour origin and normal chromogranin A values or without \n\nbone involvement, an individual benefit-risk assessment should be performed prior to the start of \n\nAfinitor therapy. Limited evidence of PFS benefit was reported in the subgroup of patients with ileum \n\nas primary tumour origin (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\nCo-administration with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or the multidrug efflux pump \n\nP-glycoprotein (PgP) should be avoided. If co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP \n\ninhibitor or inducer cannot be avoided, dose adjustments of Afinitor can be taken into consideration \n\nbased on predicted AUC (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors result in dramatically increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of everolimus (see section 4.5). There are currently not sufficient data to allow dosing \n\nrecommendations in this situation. Hence, concomitant treatment of Afinitor and potent inhibitors is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when Afinitor is taken in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic index due to the potential for drug interactions. If Afinitor is \n\ntaken with orally administered CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. pimozide, \n\nterfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, quinidine or ergot alkaloid derivatives), the patient should be \n\nmonitored for undesirable effects described in the product information of the orally administered \n\nCYP3A4 substrate (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nExposure to everolimus was increased in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) \n\nand severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nAfinitor is only recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) if the \n\npotential benefit outweighs the risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nNo clinical safety or efficacy data are currently available to support dose adjustment recommendations \n\nfor the management of adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\nThe use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Afinitor (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLactose \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nWound healing complications \n\nImpaired wound healing is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. Caution \n\nshould therefore be exercised with the use of Afinitor in the peri-surgical period. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of PgP. Therefore, \n\nabsorption and subsequent elimination of everolimus may be influenced by products that affect \n\nCYP3A4 and/or PgP. In vitro, everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mixed inhibitor \n\nof CYP2D6. \n\n \n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and PgP are \n\nlisted in Table 2 below. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors increasing everolimus concentrations \n\nSubstances that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may increase everolimus blood concentrations by \n\ndecreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 and PgP inducers decreasing everolimus concentrations \n\nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP may decrease everolimus blood concentrations by \n\nincreasing metabolism or the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2 Effects of other active substances on everolimus \n\n \n\nActive substance by \n\ninteraction \n\n \n\nInteraction \u2013 Change in \n\nEverolimus AUC/Cmax \n\nGeometric mean ratio \n\n(observed range) \n\nRecommendations concerning \n\nco-administration \n\n \nPotent CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors \n\nKetoconazole AUC \u219115.3-fold \n\n(range 11.2-22.5) \n\nCmax \u21914.1-fold \n\n(range 2.6-7.0) \n\nConcomitant treatment of Afinitor \n\nand potent inhibitors is not \n\nrecommended. \n\nItraconazole, \n\nposaconazole, \n\nvoriconazole \n\nNot studied. Large increase in \n\neverolimus concentration is \n\nexpected. \n\nTelithromycin, \n\nclarithromycin \n\nNefazodone \n\nRitonavir, atazanavir, \n\nsaquinavir, darunavir, \n\nindinavir, nelfinavir \n\n \nModerate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors \n\nErythromycin AUC \u21914.4-fold \n\n(range 2.0-12.6) \n\nCmax \u21912.0-fold \n\n(range 0.9-3.5) \n\nUse caution when \n\nco-administration of moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP \n\ninhibitors cannot be avoided. If \n\npatients require co-administration \n\nof a moderate CYP3A4 or PgP \n\ninhibitor, dose reduction to 5 mg \n\ndaily or 2.5 mg daily may be \n\nconsidered. However, there are no \n\nclinical data with this dose \n\nadjustment. Due to between \n\nsubject variability the \n\nrecommended dose adjustments \n\nmay not be optimal in all \n\nindividuals, therefore close \n\nmonitoring of side effects is \n\nrecommended. If the moderate \n\ninhibitor is discontinued, consider \n\na washout period of at least 2 to \n\n3 days (average elimination time \n\nfor most commonly used moderate \n\ninhibitors) before the Afinitor dose \n\nis returned to the dose used prior to \n\ninitiation of the co-administration. \n\nImatinib AUC \u2191 3.7-fold \nCmax \u2191 2.2-fold \n\nVerapamil AUC \u21913.5-fold \n\n(range 2.2-6.3) \n\nCmax \u21912.3-fold \n\n(range1.3-3.8) \n\nCiclosporin oral AUC \u21912.7-fold \n\n(range 1.5-4.7) \n\nCmax \u21911.8-fold \n\n(range 1.3-2.6) \n\nFluconazole Not studied. Increased exposure \n\nexpected. Diltiazem \n\nDronedarone Not studied. Increased exposure \n\nexpected. \n\nAmprenavir, \n\nfosamprenavir \n\nNot studied. Increased exposure \n\nexpected. \n\nGrapefruit juice or \n\nother food affecting \n\nCYP3A4/PgP \n\nNot studied. Increased exposure \n\nexpected (the effect varies \n\nwidely). \n\nCombination should be avoided. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPotent and moderate CYP3A4 inducers \n\nRifampicin AUC \u219363% \n\n(range 0-80%) \n\nCmax \u219358% \n\n(range 10-70%) \n\nAvoid the use of concomitant \n\npotent CYP3A4 inducers. If \n\npatients require co-administration \n\nof a potent CYP3A4 inducer, an \n\nAfinitor dose increase from 10 mg \n\ndaily up to 20 mg daily should be \n\nconsidered using 5 mg increments \n\nor less applied on Day 4 and 8 \n\nfollowing start of the inducer. This \n\ndose of Afinitor is predicted to \n\nadjust the AUC to the range \n\nobserved without inducers. \n\nHowever, there are no clinical data \n\nwith this dose adjustment. If \n\ntreatment with the inducer is \n\ndiscontinued, consider a washout \n\nperiod of at least 3 to 5 days \n\n(reasonable time for significant \n\nenzyme de-induction), before the \n\nAfinitor dose is returned to the \n\ndose used prior to initiation of the \n\nco-administration. \n\nDexamethasone Not studied. Decreased exposure \n\nexpected. \n\nCarbamazepine, \n\nphenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin \n\nNot studied. Decreased exposure \n\nexpected. \n\nEfavirenz, nevirapine Not studied. Decreased exposure \n\nexpected. \n\nSt John\u2019s Wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum) \n\nNot studied. Large decrease in \n\nexposure expected. \n\nPreparations containing St John\u2019s \n\nWort should not be used during \n\ntreatment with everolimus \n\n \n\nAgents whose plasma concentration may be altered by everolimus \n\nBased on in vitro results, the systemic concentrations obtained after oral daily doses of 10 mg make \n\ninhibition of PgP, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 unlikely. However, inhibition of CYP3A4 and PgP in the \n\ngut cannot be excluded. An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration \n\nof an oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% \n\nincrease in midazolam Cmax and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC(0-inf). The effect is likely to be due \n\nto inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by everolimus. Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of \n\norally co-administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of \n\nsystemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCo-administration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide Cmin with a geometric mean \n\nratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47. A clinically significant effect on the efficacy response to \n\neverolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours could not be established. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of everolimus and exemestane increased exemestane Cmin and C2h by 45% and 64%, \n\nrespectively. However, the corresponding oestradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different \n\nbetween the two treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed \n\nin patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The \n\nincrease in exemestane levels is unlikely to have an impact on efficacy or safety. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n\nPatients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor (e.g. ramipril) therapy may be at increased risk for \n\nangioedema (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\nThe immune response to vaccination may be affected and, therefore, vaccination may be less effective \n\nduring treatment with Afinitor. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with \n\nAfinitor (see section 4.4). Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, \n\nrubella, oral polio, BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin), yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid \n\nvaccines. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, \n\ninjected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based \n\ncontraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device \n\n[IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after \n\nending treatment. Male patients should not be prohibited from attempting to father children. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The \n\npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nEverolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether everolimus is excreted in human breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus \n\nand/or its metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus \n\nshould not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThe potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however \n\namenorrhoea (secondary amenorrhoea and other menstrual irregularities) and associated luteinising \n\nhormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) imbalance has been observed in female patients. \n\nBased on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with \n\neverolimus (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAfinitor may have a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients \n\nshould be advised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue during \n\ntreatment with Afinitor. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from 2,879 patients treated with Afinitor in eleven clinical \n\nstudies, consisting of five randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III studies and six open-\n\nlabel phase I and phase II studies, related to the approved indications. \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651/10) from the pooled safety data were (in \n\ndecreasing order): stomatitis, rash, fatigue, diarrhoea, infections, nausea, decreased appetite, anaemia, \n\ndysgeusia, pneumonitis, oedema peripheral, hyperglycaemia, asthenia, pruritus, weight decreased, \n\nhypercholesterolaemia, epistaxis, cough and headache. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22651/100 to <1/10) were stomatitis, anaemia, \n\nhyperglycaemia, infections, fatigue, diarrhoea, pneumonitis, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, \n\ndyspnoea, proteinuria, lymphopenia, haemorrhage, hypophosphataemia, rash, hypertension, \n\npneumonia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased \n\nand diabetes mellitus. The grades follow CTCAE Version 3.0 and 4.03. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 3 presents the frequency category of adverse reactions reported in the pooled analysis \n\nconsidered for the safety pooling. Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ \n\nclass and frequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n\n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \n\norder of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nVery common Infections a, * \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery common Anaemia \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia \n\nUncommon Pancytopenia \n\nRare Pure red cell aplasia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common Decreased appetite, hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolaemia \n\nCommon Hypertriglyceridaemia, hypophosphataemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, \n\nhypokalaemia, dehydration, hypocalcaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nCommon Insomnia \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common Dysgeusia, headache \n\nUncommon Ageusia \n\nEye disorders \n\nCommon Eyelid oedema \n\nUncommon Conjunctivitis \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nUncommon Congestive cardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Haemorrhage b, hypertension \n\nUncommon Flushing, deep vein thrombosis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Pneumonitis c, epistaxis, cough \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nUncommon Haemoptysis, pulmonary embolism \n\nRare Acute respiratory distress syndrome \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common Stomatitis d, diarrhoea, nausea \n\nCommon Vomiting, dry mouth, abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, oral pain, dyspepsia, \n\ndysphagia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCommon Aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nVery common Rash, pruritus \n\nCommon Dry skin, nail disorders, mild alopecia, acne, erythema, onychoclasis, palmar-plantar \n\nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome, skin exfoliation, skin lesion \n\nRare Angioedema* \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Arthralgia \n\n\n\n13 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon Proteinuria*, blood creatinine increased, renal failure* \n\nUncommon Increased daytime urination, acute renal failure* \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nCommon Menstruation irregular e \n\nUncommon Amenorrhoea e* \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common Fatigue, asthenia, oedema peripheral \n\nCommon Pyrexia \n\nUncommon Non-cardiac chest pain, impaired wound healing \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common Weight decreased \n\n* See also subsection \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d \na Includes all reactions within the \u2018infections and infestations\u2019 system organ class including \n\n(common) pneumonia, urinary tract infection; (uncommon) bronchitis, herpes zoster, sepsis, \n\nabscess, and isolated cases of opportunistic infections [e.g. aspergillosis, candidiasis, PJP/PCP \n\nand hepatitis B (see also section 4.4)] and (rare) viral myocarditis \nb Includes different bleeding events from different sites not listed individually \nc Includes (very common) pneumonitis, (common) interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration and \n\n(rare) pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, pulmonary toxicity, and alveolitis \nd Includes (very common) stomatitis, (common) aphthous stomatitis, mouth and tongue ulceration \n\nand (uncommon) glossodynia, glossitis \ne Frequency based upon number of women from 10 to 55 years of age in the pooled data \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with \n\nserious cases of hepatitis B reactivation, including fatal outcome. Reactivation of infection is an \n\nexpected event during periods of immunosuppression. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with renal \n\nfailure events (including fatal outcome) and proteinuria. Monitoring of renal function is recommended \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases \n\nof amenorrhoea (secondary amenorrhoea and other menstrual irregularities). \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with cases \n\nof PJP/PCP, some with fatal outcome (see section 4.4). \n\n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing spontaneous reports, angioedema has been reported with and \n\nwithout concomitant use of ACE inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n\n \nElderly patients \n\nIn the safety pooling, 37% of the Afinitor-treated patients were \u226565 years of age. The number of \n\npatients with an adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of the medicinal product was higher in \n\npatients \u226565 years of age (20% vs. 13%). The most common adverse reactions leading to \n\ndiscontinuation were pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease), stomatitis, fatigue and \n\ndyspnoea. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nReported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 70 mg have been \n\ngiven with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, protein kinase \n\ninhibitors, ATC code: L01XE10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nEverolimus is a selective mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR is a key \n\nserine-threonine kinase, the activity of which is known to be upregulated in a number of human \n\ncancers. Everolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12, forming a complex that inhibits \n\nmTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity. Inhibition of the mTORC1 signalling pathway interferes with \n\nthe translation and synthesis of proteins by reducing the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase \n\n(S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP-1) that regulate proteins involved \n\nin the cell cycle, angiogenesis and glycolysis. S6K1is thought to phosphorylate the activation function \n\ndomain 1 of the oestrogen receptor, which is responsible for ligand-independent receptor activation. \n\nEverolimus reduces levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which potentiates tumour \n\nangiogenic processes. Everolimus is a potent inhibitor of the growth and proliferation of tumour cells, \n\nendothelial cells, fibroblasts and blood-vessel-associated smooth muscle cells and has been shown to \n\nreduce glycolysis in solid tumours in vitro and in vivo. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nHormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer \n\nBOLERO-2 (study CRAD001Y2301), a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase III study of \n\nAfinitor + exemestane versus placebo + exemestane, was conducted in postmenopausal women with \n\noestrogen receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or \n\nprogression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole. Randomisation was stratified by \n\ndocumented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy and by the presence of visceral metastasis. \n\nSensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete \n\nresponse [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u226524 weeks) from at least one prior hormonal \n\ntherapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to \n\nrecurrence. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST \n\n(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on the investigator\u2019s assessment (local \n\nradiology). Supportive PFS analyses were based on an independent central radiology review. \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, \n\nsafety, change in quality of life (QoL) and time to ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \n\nperformance status) deterioration. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nA total of 724 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the combination everolimus (10 mg daily) + \n\nexemestane (25 mg daily) (n=485) or to the placebo + exemestane arm (25 mg daily) (n=239). At the \n\ntime of the final OS analysis, the median duration of everolimus treatment was 24.0 weeks (range \n\n1.0-199.1 weeks). The median duration of exemestane treatment was longer in the everolimus + \n\nexemestane group at 29.5 weeks (1.0-199.1) compared to 14.1 weeks (1.0-156.0) in the placebo + \n\nexemestane group. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy results for the primary endpoint were obtained from the final PFS analysis (see Table 4 \n\nand Figure 1). Patients in the placebo + exemestane arm did not cross over to everolimus at the time of \n\nprogression. \n\n \n\nTable 4 BOLERO-2 efficacy results \n\n \n\nAnalysis Afinitora \n\nn=485 \n\nPlaceboa \n\nn=239 \n\nHazard ratio p value \n\nMedian progression-free survival (months) (95% CI) \n\nInvestigator radiological review 7.8 \n\n(6.9 to 8.5) \n\n3.2 \n\n(2.8 to 4.1) \n\n0.45 \n\n(0.38 to 0.54) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nIndependent radiological review 11.0 \n\n(9.7 to 15.0) \n\n4.1 \n\n(2.9 to 5.6) \n\n0.38 \n\n(0.31 to 0.48) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nMedian overall survival (months) (95% CI) \n\nMedian overall survival 31.0 \n\n(28.0 \u2013 34.6) \n\n26.6 \n\n(22.6 \u2013 33.1) \n\n0.89 \n\n(0.73 \u2013 1.10) \n\n0.1426 \n\nBest overall response (%) (95% CI) \n\nObjective response rateb \n\n \n\n12.6% \n\n(9.8 to 15.9) \n\n1.7% \n\n(0.5 to 4.2) \nn/ad <0.0001e \n\n     \n\nClinical benefit ratec 51.3% \n\n(46.8 to 55.9) \n\n26.4% \n\n(20.9 to 32.4) \nn/ad <0.0001e \n\na Plus exemestane \nb Objective response rate = proportion of patients with complete or partial response \nc Clinical benefit rate = proportion of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease \n\n\u226524 weeks \nd Not applicable \ne p value is obtained from the exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test using a stratified version of the \n\nCochran-Armitage permutation test. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nFigure 1 BOLERO-2 Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival curves (investigator \n\nradiological review) \n\n \nThe estimated PFS treatment effect was supported by planned subgroup analysis of PFS per \n\ninvestigator assessment.

Prior therapy \n\nwith bevacizumab and interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Patients were stratified according to Memorial \n\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic score (favourable- vs. intermediate- vs. poor-risk \n\ngroups) and prior anticancer therapy (1 vs. 2 prior VEGFR-TKIs). \n\n \n\nProgression-free survival, documented using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \n\nTumours) and assessed via a blinded, independent central review, was the primary endpoint. \n\nSecondary endpoints included safety, objective tumour response rate, overall survival, disease-related \n\nsymptoms, and quality of life. After documented radiological progression, patients could be unblinded \n\nby the investigator: those randomised to placebo were then able to receive open-label everolimus \n\n10 mg/day. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended termination of this trial at the \n\ntime of the second interim analysis as the primary endpoint had been met. \n\n \n\nIn total, 416 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Afinitor (n=277) or placebo (n=139). \n\nDemographics were well balanced (pooled median age [61 years; range 27-85], 78% male, 88% \n\nCaucasian, number of prior VEGFR-TKI therapies [1-74%, 2-26%]). The median duration of blinded \n\nstudy treatment was 141 days (range 19-451 days) for patients receiving everolimus and 60 days \n\n(range 21-295 days) for those receiving placebo. \n\n \n\nAfinitor was superior to placebo for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, with a \n\nstatistically significant 67% reduction in the risk of progression or death (see Table 7 and Figure 6). \n\n \n\nTable 7 RECORD-1 \u2013 Progression-free survival results \n\n \n\nPopulation n Afinitor \n\nn=277 \n\nPlacebo \n\nn=139 \n\nHazard ratio \n\n(95%CI) \n\np-value \n\n  Median progression-free \n\nsurvival (months) (95% CI) \n\n  \n\nPrimary analysis \n\nAll (blinded independent \n\ncentral review) \n\n416 4.9 \n\n(4.0-5.5) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.8-1.9) \n\n0.33 \n\n(0.25-0.43) \n\n<0.0001a \n\nSupportive/sensitivity analyses \n\nAll (local review by \n\ninvestigator) \n\n416 5.5 \n\n(4.6-5.8) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.8-2.2) \n\n0.32 \n\n(0.25-0.41) \n\n<0.0001a \n\nMSKCC prognostic score (blinded independent central review) \n\nFavourable risk 120 5.8 \n\n(4.0-7.4) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.9-2.8) \n\n0.31 \n\n(0.19-0.50) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nIntermediate risk 235 4.5 \n\n(3.8-5.5) \n\n1.8 \n\n(1.8-1.9) \n\n0.32 \n\n(0.22-0.44) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nPoor risk 61 3.6 \n\n(1.9-4.6) \n\n1.8 \n\n(1.8-3.6) \n\n0.44 \n\n(0.22-0.85) \n\n0.007 \n\na Stratified log-rank test \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nFigure 6 RECORD-1 \u2013 Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival curves (independent central \n\nreview) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSix-month PFS rates were 36% for Afinitor therapy compared with 9% for placebo. \n\n \n\nConfirmed objective tumour responses were observed in 5 patients (2%) receiving Afinitor, while \n\nnone were observed in patients receiving placebo. Therefore, the progression-free survival advantage \n\nprimarily reflects the population with disease stabilisation (corresponding to 67% of the Afinitor \n\ntreatment group). \n\n \n\nNo statistically significant treatment-related difference in overall survival was noted (hazard \n\nratio 0.87; confidence interval: 0.65-1.17; p=0.177). Crossover to open-label Afinitor following \n\ndisease progression for patients allocated to placebo confounded the detection of any treatment-related \n\ndifference in overall survival. \n\n \n\nOther studies \n\nStomatitis is the most commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with Afinitor (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). In a post-marketing single-arm study in postmenopausal women with advanced \n\nbreast cancer (N=92), topical treatment with dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml alcohol-free oral solution \n\nwas administered as a mouthwash (4 times daily for the initial 8 weeks of treatment) to patients at the \n\ntime of initiating treatment with Afinitor (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) to reduce the \n\nincidence and severity of stomatitis. The incidence of Grade \u22652 stomatitis at 8 weeks was 2.4% \n\n(n=2/85 evaluable patients) which was lower than historically reported. The incidence of Grade 1 \n\nstomatitis was 18.8% (n=16/85) and no cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. The overall \n\nsafety profile in this study was consistent with that established for everolimus in the oncology and \n\ntuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) settings, with the exception of a slightly increased frequency of oral \n\ncandidiasis which was reported in 2.2% (n=2/92) of patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nAfinitor in all subsets of the paediatric population in neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin, \n\nthoracic neuroendocrine tumours and in renal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use). \n\nHazard Ratio = 0.33 \n\n95% CI [0.25, 0.43] \n\n \n\nKaplan-Meier medians \n\nEverolimus: 4.90 months \n\nPlacebo: 1.87 months \n\n \n\nLog-rank p value = <0.0001 \n\nCensoring Times \n\nEverolimus (n/N = 155/277) \n\nPlacebo (n/N = 111/139) \n\nTime (months) \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\nili\n\nty\n (\n\n%\n) \n\nNo. of patients still at risk \n\nTime (months) \n\nAfinitor \n\nPlacebo \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\nIn patients with advanced solid tumours, peak everolimus concentrations (Cmax) are reached at a \n\nmedian time of 1 hour after daily administration of 5 and 10 mg everolimus under fasting conditions \n\nor with a light fat-free snack. Cmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. Everolimus is a substrate \n\nand moderate inhibitor of PgP. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nIn healthy subjects, high fat meals reduced systemic exposure to everolimus 10 mg (as measured by \n\nAUC) by 22% and the peak plasma concentration Cmax by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by 32% \n\nand Cmax by 42%. Food, however, had no apparent effect on the post absorption phase \n\nconcentration-time profile. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to \n\n5,000 ng/ml, is 17% to 73%. Approximately 20% of the everolimus concentration in whole blood is \n\nconfined to plasma in cancer patients given everolimus 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is \n\napproximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In \n\npatients with advanced solid tumours, Vd was 191 l for the apparent central compartment and 517 l for \n\nthe apparent peripheral compartment. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main \n\ncirculating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in \n\nhuman blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, \n\nand a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal \n\nspecies used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus \n\nitself. Hence, everolimus is considered to contribute the majority of the overall pharmacological \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nMean oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus after 10 mg daily dose in patients with advanced solid \n\ntumours was 24.5 l/h. The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. \n\n \n\nNo specific excretion studies have been undertaken in cancer patients; however, data are available \n\nfrom the studies in transplant patients. Following the administration of a single dose of radiolabelled \n\neverolimus in conjunction with ciclosporin, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the faeces, \n\nwhile 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or faeces. \n\n \n\nSteady-state pharmacokinetics \n\nAfter administration of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumours, steady-state AUC0-\u03c4 was \n\ndose-proportional over the range of 5 to 10 mg daily dose. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks. \n\nCmax is dose-proportional between 5 and 10 mg. tmax occurs at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. There was a \n\nsignificant correlation between AUC0-\u03c4 and pre-dose trough concentration at steady-state. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of everolimus were evaluated in two single oral dose \n\nstudies of Afinitor tablets in 8 and 34 subjects with impaired hepatic function relative to subjects with \n\nnormal hepatic function. \n\n \n\nIn the first study, the average AUC of everolimus in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh B) was twice that found in 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn the second study of 34 subjects with different impaired hepatic function compared to normal \n\nsubjects, there was a 1.6-fold, 3.3-fold and 3.6-fold increase in exposure (i.e. AUC0-inf) for subjects \n\nwith mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nSimulations of multiple dose pharmacokinetics support the dosing recommendations in subjects with \n\nhepatic impairment based on their Child-Pugh status. \n\n \n\nBased on the results of the two studies, dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 patients with advanced solid tumours, no significant \n\ninfluence of creatinine clearance (25-178 ml/min) was detected on CL/F of everolimus. Post-transplant \n\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance range 11-107 ml/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\neverolimus in transplant patients. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in cancer patients, no significant influence of age \n\n(27-85 years) on oral clearance of everolimus was detected. \n\n \n\nEthnicity \n\nOral clearance (CL/F) is similar in Japanese and Caucasian cancer patients with similar liver \n\nfunctions. Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, CL/F is on average 20% higher in black \n\ntransplant patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe preclinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mice, rats, minipigs, monkeys and rabbits. \n\nThe major target organs were male and female reproductive systems (testicular tubular degeneration, \n\nreduced sperm content in epididymides and uterine atrophy) in several species; lungs (increased \n\nalveolar macrophages) in rats and mice; pancreas (degranulation and vacuolation of exocrine cells in \n\nmonkeys and minipigs, respectively, and degeneration of islet cells in monkeys), and eyes (lenticular \n\nanterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney changes were seen in the rat (exacerbation of \n\nage-related lipofuscin in tubular epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) and mouse (exacerbation of \n\nbackground lesions). There was no indication of kidney toxicity in monkeys or minipigs. \n\n \n\nEverolimus appeared to spontaneously exacerbate background diseases (chronic myocarditis in rats, \n\ncoxsackie virus infection of plasma and heart in monkeys, coccidian infestation of the gastrointestinal \n\ntract in minipigs, skin lesions in mice and monkeys). These findings were generally observed at \n\nsystemic exposure levels within the range of therapeutic exposure or above, with the exception of the \n\nfindings in rats, which occurred below therapeutic exposure due to a high tissue distribution. \n\n \n\nIn a male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm \n\nmotility, sperm head count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a \n\nreduction in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility. \n\n \n\nIn animal reproductive studies female fertility was not affected. However, oral doses of everolimus in \n\nfemale rats at \u22650.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% of the AUC0-24h in patients receiving the 10 mg daily \n\ndose) resulted in increases in pre-implantation loss. \n\n \n\nEverolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the foetus. In rats, everolimus caused \n\nembryo/foetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the therapeutic level. This was manifested as \n\nmortality and reduced foetal weight. The incidence of skeletal variations and malformations (e.g. \n\nsternal cleft) was increased at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg. In rabbits, embryotoxicity was evident in an increase \n\nin late resorptions. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nGenotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence of clastogenic or \n\nmutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate any oncogenic \n\npotential in mice and rats up to the highest doses, corresponding respectively to 3.9 and 0.2 times the \n\nestimated clinical exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What Afinitor is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Afinitor \n\n3. How to take Afinitor \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Afinitor \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Afinitor is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAfinitor is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance everolimus. Everolimus reduces the \n\nblood supply to the tumour and slows down the growth and spread of cancer cells. \n\n \n\nAfinitor is used to treat adult patients with: \n\n\uf02d hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women, in whom other \ntreatments (so called \u201cnon-steroidal aromatase inhibitors\u201d) no longer keep the disease under \n\ncontrol. It is given together with a medicine called exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, \n\nwhich is used for hormonal anticancer therapy. \n\n\uf02d advanced tumours called neuroendocrine tumours that originate from the stomach, bowels, lung \nor pancreas. It is given if the tumours are inoperable and do not overproduce specific hormones \n\nor other related natural substances. \n\n\uf02d advanced kidney cancer (advanced renal cell carcinoma), where other treatments (so-called \n\u201cVEGF-targeted therapy\u201d) have not helped stop your disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Afinitor \n\n \n\nAfinitor will only be prescribed for you by a doctor with experience in cancer treatment. Follow all the \n\ndoctor\u2019s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained in this leaflet. \n\nIf you have any questions about Afinitor or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nDo not take Afinitor \n\n\uf02d if you are allergic to everolimus, to related substances such as sirolimus or temsirolimus, or to \nany of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Afinitor: \n\n\uf02d if you have any problems with your liver or if you have ever had any disease which may have \naffected your liver. If this is the case, your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of \n\nAfinitor. \n\n\uf02d if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). Afinitor may increase blood sugar \nlevels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in the need for insulin and/or oral \n\nantidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased \n\nfrequency of urination. \n\n\uf02d if you need to receive a vaccine while taking Afinitor. \n\n\uf02d if you have high cholesterol. Afinitor may elevate cholesterol and/or other blood fats. \n\n\uf02d if you have had recent major surgery, or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery. \nAfinitor may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. \n\n\uf02d if you have an infection. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Afinitor. \n\n\uf02d if you have previously had hepatitis B, because this may be reactivated during treatment with \nAfinitor (see section 4 \u2018Possible side effects\u2019). \n\n \n\nAfinitor may also: \n\n\uf02d weaken your immune system. Therefore, you may be at risk of getting an infection while you \nare taking Afinitor. If you have fever or other signs of an infection, consult with your doctor. \n\nSome infections may be severe and may have fatal consequences. \n\n\uf02d impact your kidney function. Therefore, your doctor will monitor your kidney function while \nyou are taking Afinitor. \n\n\uf02d cause shortness of breath, cough and fever. \n\n\uf02d cause mouth ulcers and sores to develop. Your doctor might need to interrupt or discontinue \nyour treatment with Afinitor. You might need treatment with a mouthwash, gel or other \n\nproducts. Some mouthwashes and gels can make ulcers worse, so do not try anything without \n\nchecking with your doctor first. Your doctor might restart treatment with Afinitor at the same \n\ndose or at a lower dose. \n\nTell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. \n\n \n\nYou will have regular blood tests during treatment. These will check the amount of blood cells (white \n\nblood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in your body to see if Afinitor is having an unwanted effect \n\non these cells. Blood tests will also be carried out to check your kidney function (level of creatinine) \n\nand liver function (level of transaminases) and your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. This is because \n\nthese can also be affected by Afinitor. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAfinitor is not to be used in children or adolescents (age below 18 years). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Afinitor \nAfinitor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are taking other medicines at the same \n\ntime as Afinitor, your doctor may need to change the dose of Afinitor or the other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nThe following may increase the risk of side effects with Afinitor: \n\n\uf02d ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole and other antifungals used to treat \nfungal infections. \n\n\uf02d clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. \n\n\uf02d ritonavir and other medicines used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n\uf02d verapamil or diltiazem, used to treat heart conditions or high blood pressure. \n\n\uf02d dronedarone, a medicine used to help regulate your heart beat. \n\n\uf02d ciclosporin, a medicine used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants. \n\n\uf02d imatinib, used to inhibit the growth of abnormal cells. \n\n\uf02d angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as ramipril) used to treat high blood \npressure or other cardiovascular problems. \n\n\uf02d nefazodone, used to treat depression. \n \n\nThe following may reduce the effectiveness of Afinitor: \n\n\uf02d rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB). \n\n\uf02d efavirenz or nevirapine, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. \n\n\uf02d St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression and other \nconditions. \n\n\uf02d dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of conditions including \ninflammatory or immune problems. \n\n\uf02d phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or fits. \n \n\nThese medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Afinitor. If you are taking any of them, \n\nyour doctor may switch you to a different medicine, or may change your dose of Afinitor. \n\n \n\nAfinitor with food and drink \n\nAvoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are on Afinitor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAfinitor could harm your unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if \n\nyou are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you \n\nshould take this medicine during your pregnancy. \n\n \n\nWomen who could potentially become pregnant should use highly effective contraception during \n\ntreatment and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment. If, despite these measures, you think you may \n\nhave become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before taking any more Afinitor. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nAfinitor could harm your breast-fed baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment and for \n\n2 weeks after the last dose of Afinitor. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFemale fertility \n\nAbsence of menstrual periods (amenorrhoea) has been observed in some female patients receiving \n\nAfinitor. \n\n \n\nAfinitor may have an impact on female fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to have children. \n\n \n\nMale fertility \n\nAfinitor may affect male fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to father a child. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you feel unusually tired (fatigue is a very common side effect), take special care when driving or \n\nusing machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nAfinitor contains lactose \n\nAfinitor contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Urgent treatment may be necessary. \n\n\uf02d Take the carton and this leaflet, so that the doctor knows what has been taken. \n \n\nIf you forget to take Afinitor \n\nIf you miss a dose, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for the \n\nforgotten tablets. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Afinitor \n\nDo not stop taking Afinitor unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
