This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAxumin 1600 MBq/mL solution for injection \nAxumin 3200 MBq/mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAxumin 1600 MBq/mL solution for injection \nEach mL of solution contains 1600 MBq of fluciclovine (18F) at the date and time of calibration (ToC).  \n \nThe activity per vial ranges from 1600 MBq to 16000 MBq at the date and time of calibration (ToC).  \n \nAxumin 3200 MBq/mL solution for injection \nEach mL of solution contains 3200 MBq of fluciclovine (18F) at the date and time of calibration (ToC).  \n \nThe activity per vial ranges from 3200 MBq to 32000 MBq at the date and time of calibration (ToC).  \n \nFluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of 110 minutes by emitting a positronic \nradiation of maximum energy of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV.  \n \nExcipients with known effect  \nEach mL of solution contains 7.7 mg of sodium.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \nClear, colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nAxumin is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to detect recurrence of \nprostate cancer in adult men with a suspected recurrence based on elevated blood prostate specific \nantigen (PSA) levels after primary curative treatment. \n \nFor the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see section 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nA PET scan with fluciclovine (18F) should be administered by appropriately qualified healthcare \nprofessionals. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nImages should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with \nfluciclovine (18F). \n \nPosology \nAdults  \nThe recommended activity for an adult is 370 MBq fluciclovine (18F). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment  \nAxumin has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. \nCareful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible in these patients. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment required. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of fluciclovine (18F) in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration  \nAxumin is for intravenous use.  \n \nThe activity of fluciclovine (18F) has to be measured with an activimeter immediately prior to \ninjection. \n \nAxumin should be administered as a bolus intravenous injection. The recommended maximum volume \nof injection of undiluted Axumin is 5 mL. Axumin may be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection by a factor of 8. The injection should be followed by an intravenous flush \nof sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full delivery of the dose. \n \nAxumin is for multidose use. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. \n \nFor patient preparation, see section 4.4. \n \nImage acquisition \nThe patient should be positioned supine with arms above the head. A CT scan should be obtained for \nattenuation correction and anatomic correlation. PET scanning should begin from 3-5 minutes (target \n4 minutes) after completion of the injection; an acquisition time of 3 minutes per bed position is \nrecommended. Increasing the duration of acquisition over the pelvis may increase the sensitivity of \ndetection of disease. It is recommended that image acquisition should start from mid-thigh and \nproceed to the base of the skull. Typical total scan time is between 20-30 minutes. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification  \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity \nadministered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \ndiagnostic information.  \n \nThe PSA value may affect the diagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) PET. (see section 5.1, \nPharmacodynamic properties). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment  \nCareful consideration of the benefit/risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible.  \n \nPaediatric population \nFor information on use in the paediatric population, see section 4.2. \n \nPatient preparation  \nIt should be recommended to the patient that they do not undertake any significant exercise for at least \na day before the fluciclovine (18F) scan. \n \nPrior to administration of fluciclovine (18F), patients should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours (other \nthan small amounts of water for taking medicinal products).   \nIn order to mitigate the quantity and intensity of early excretion into the bladder, which may mask or \nmimic local prostate cancer recurrence, patients should be informed that they may void at the latest 60 \nminutes before injection of fluciclovine (18F), and should then refrain from voiding until after the scan \nhas been completed. \n \nInterpretation of fluciclovine (18F) images and limitations of use \nFluciclovine (18F) images should be interpreted by appropriately trained personnel.  \n \nPET images with fluciclovine (18F) should be interpreted visually. Suspicion of cancer in sites typical \nfor prostate cancer recurrence is based on fluciclovine (18F) uptake in comparison with tissue \nbackground. For small lesions (<1 cm diameter) focal uptake greater than blood pool should be \nconsidered suspicious for cancer. For larger lesions, uptake equal to or greater than bone marrow is \nconsidered suspicious for cancer. \n \nThe impact of quantitative/semiquantitative measurement of fluciclovine (18F) uptake as an aid to \nimage interpretation has not been assessed. \n \nImage interpretation errors can occur with PET with fluciclovine (18F) (see section 5.1).   \n \nFluciclovine (18F) uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer, \nprostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. False-positive cases have been also described in \nassociation with an inflammatory response after cryotherapy and radiation artefacts in patients \npreviously treated with radiotherapy. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological \nevaluation of the suspected recurrence site, should be considered where appropriate. \n \nThe use of either intravenous iodinated CT contrast or oral contrast media is not required to interpret \nfluciclovine (18F) PET images. \n \nThe detection of prostate cancer recurrence in prostate/prostate bed, regional lymph nodes, bone, soft \ntissue and non-regional lymph nodes by fluciclovine (18F) PET has been reported.  \n \nDiagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) to detect recurrences has not been investigated in patients \nwith a suspected recurrence based on elevated blood PSA levels after primary radical treatment with a \nrecent positive whole-body bone scintigraphy. \n \nAfter the procedure  \nThe patient should be encouraged to drink sufficient amounts and void as often as possible during the \nfirst hours after the scan in order to reduce radiation exposure of the bladder. \n \nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 12 hours \nfollowing the injection.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSpecific warnings  \nThis medicinal product contains up to 39 mg sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration by \npatients on a controlled sodium diet.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nThe impact of anti-mitotic agents and colony stimulating factors on uptake of fluciclovine in patients \nwith prostate cancer has not been studied. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nFluciclovine (18F) is not indicated for use in women. \n \nFertility \nNo studies on fertility have been performed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAxumin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. As the effective dose is 8.2 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of \n370 MBq is administered these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low probability.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions were reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) during clinical trials.  \nThey are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class.  \n \n\nMedDRA system organ class Adverse reactions \n \n\nNervous system disorders Dysgeusia  \n \n\nRespiratory thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nParosmia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site reactions  \n \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of administration of a radiation overdose with fluciclovine (18F) the absorbed dose to the \npatient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the \nbody by forced diuresis, frequent micturition and defecation. It might be helpful to estimate the \neffective dose that was applied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for tumour detection, ATC code: \nV09IX12. \n \nMechanism of action \nFluciclovine (18F) is a synthetic amino acid which is transported across mammalian cell membranes by \namino acid transporters such as LAT-1 and ASCT2. The activities of LAT-1 and ASCT2 are known to \nbe upregulated in prostate cancer, providing a mechanism for the enhanced accumulation of \nfluciclovine (18F) in prostate cancer.  \n \nA quantitative correlation between fluciclovine uptake and enhanced fluciclovine influx into cells was \nnot assessed in vivo in healthy volunteers or prostate cancer patients. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAt the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, fluciclovine (18F) does not appear to \nhave any pharmacodynamic activity.   \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe pivotal efficacy data derives from 115 patients recruited into the BED-001 study at Emory \nUniversity.  Patients were adult and elderly men presenting with suspected recurrence, based on \nelevated blood PSA levels after primary curative treatment of localized prostate cancer and with \nnegative bone scintigraphy. Patients with non-surgical therapy were treated at least 2 years before. \nFluciclovine (18F) PET-CT was restricted to the abdomino-pelvic region. \n \nHistopathology standard of truth data was available for 99 of the 115 subjects. Histological assessment  \nof extraprostatic sites (either regional lymph nodes or distant sites) was only conducted for sites with \npositive image findings. \n\nThe diagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) PET-CT for the detection of recurrence overall (at any \nlocation), and in 3 different locations (prostate/bed, pelvic lymph nodes, and distant metastases) is \nshown in Table 1. Distant metastases involved distal lymph nodes, soft tissue and bone. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1.

Blinded reads were compared with the \nhistopathological standard of truth. The patient-based sensitivity of fluciclovine (18F) was higher than \n88.6% for all three readers while specificity ranged from 17.2-53.6%. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAxumin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in diagnosis of amino acid metabolism in \nsolid tumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nFluciclovine (18F) distributes immediately following administration to the liver (14% of administered \nactivity), pancreas (3%), lung (7%), red bone marrow (12%) and heart wall (4%).  \nFluciclovine is not incorporated into proteins. Fluciclovine is not metabolised in vivo. \n \nOrgan uptake \nFluciclovine (18F) accumulates in prostate cancer and other types of cancer but also in normal tissues \nand some other prostate pathologies (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, high \ngrade prostatic intraepithelial hyperplasia). In addition, fluciclovine uptake may be increased by an \ninflammatory reaction to recent radiotherapy or cryotherapy. \n \nFluciclovine (18F) is preferentially taken up into prostate cancer cells compared with surrounding \nnormal tissues.  Uptake by tumours is rapid, with the highest tumour-to-normal tissue contrast between \n4 and 10 minutes after injection and continuing for around 30 minutes, with a 61% reduction in mean \ntumour uptake at 90 minutes after injection. \n \nWashout of activity from most organs and tissues (with the exception of the pancreas) is slow. \nActivity in the brain is low. With increasing time post injection, distributed uptake is apparent and is \nmostly associated with skeletal muscle. Washout of 18F activity from the blood is such that about half \nof the maximum 18F concentration in blood is reached by about 1 hour after administration. \n \nElimination \nThe major route of elimination is via the renal pathway. Urinary excretion is slow, reaching \napproximately 3% of administered radioactivity within 4 hours and 5% within 24 hours. \n \nHalf-life  \nThe effective half-life of fluciclovine (18F) equates to the radioactive half-life of fluorine (18F), which \nis approximately 110 minutes.  \n \nRenal/Hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised. \n \nIn in vitro studies, fluciclovine (18F) was not taken up by common drug transporters indicating a \nnegligible potential for drug interactions. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicological studies with rats and dogs have demonstrated that with a single intravenous injection no \ndeaths were observed. Toxicity with repeated administration of up to 1000 mcg/kg/day over 14 days in \nrats and dogs was not observed. This medicinal product is not intended for regular or continuous \nadministration. Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nAxumin 1600 MBq/mL solution for injection \nAxumin 3200 MBq/mL solution for injection \n\nfluciclovine (18F) \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Axumin is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before Axumin is used \n3. How Axumin is used \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How Axumin is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Axumin is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. \n \nAxumin contains the active ingredient fluciclovine (18F) and is given so that doctors can perform a \nspecial type of scan called a PET scan. If you have previously had treatment for prostate cancer and \ninformation from other tests (e.g. prostate specific antigen, PSA) indicates that the cancer may have \nreturned, an Axumin PET scan can help your doctor find the locations where the cancer has come \nback.  \n \nYou should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. \n \nThe use of Axumin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the benefit of this procedure with the \nradiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Axumin is used \n \nAxumin must not be used: \n- if you are allergic to fluciclovine (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Axumin if you: \n- have kidney problems \n- are on a low sodium diet (see section \"Axumin contains sodium\"). \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nBefore administration of Axumin you: \n- should avoid exercise for at least a day before the Axumin scan. \n- should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan (you can take your usual medicines \n\nwith small amounts of water).   \n- may urinate at the latest 60 minutes before the Axumin injection and you should avoid urination \n\nuntil after the scan has been completed. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. Axumin is not intended for use in \nchildren and adolescents aged under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Axumin  \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThis medicine is not indicated for use in women. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nIt is considered unlikely that Axumin will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nAxumin contains sodium \nThis medicine contains up to 39 mg sodium per dose. This should be taken into consideration if you \nare on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How Axumin is used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.  \nAxumin will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given \nto you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for \nthe safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.  \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Axumin to be \nused in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  The \nquantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 370 MBq (megabecquerel, the unit \nused to express radioactivity). \n \nAdministration of Axumin and conduct of the procedure  \nAxumin is administered intravenously as an injection into your vein followed by a flush of sodium \nchloride solution to ensure that you receive the full dose.  \n \nOne injection is usually sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. \n \nDuration of the procedure  \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. The scan will \nusually start approximately 5 minutes after the Axumin injection is given. \n \nAfter administration of Axumin you should:  \n- avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 12 hours following the \n\ninjection \n- urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from your body. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after \nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nIf you have been given more Axumin than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Axumin precisely controlled by \nthe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will \nreceive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the nuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure \nmay provide ways to increase the passing of urine and stools in order to facilitate the removal of \nradioactivity from your body. \n \nShould you have any further question on the use of Axumin, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor \nwho supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In clinical \nstudies side effects were reported by less than 1 in 100 patients given the medicine. \n \nThe following side effects of Axumin are common (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).  \n- Pain or rash at the site of injection, altered taste in the mouth, altered sense of smell. \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk \nof cancer and hereditary abnormalities.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How Axumin is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this medicine. This medicine is stored under the responsibility of the \nspecialist in appropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with national \nregulation on radioactive materials.  \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only.  \n \nAxumin must not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the shield label after Exp. \n \n \n6.

High \nbladder fluciclovine activity may have significant impact on the evaluation of local prostate cancer \nrecurrence, as it may mask areas of local prostate cancer recurrence. Therefore, in view of the \navailable data, the PRAC concluded that a recommendation concerning voiding instructions prior to \nadministration of fluciclovine (18F) was considered necessary. The product information of products \ncontaining fluciclovine (18F) should be amended accordingly.  \n\n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for fluciclovine (18F) the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fluciclovine (18F) is unchanged subject \nto the proposed changes to the product information. \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
