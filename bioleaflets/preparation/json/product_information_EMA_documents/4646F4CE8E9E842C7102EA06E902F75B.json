NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPrepandrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nPrepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) like strain used (PR8-IBCDC-RG2)  3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-α-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion vials once mixed form a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \nThe vaccines contains 5 micrograms thiomersal (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid. \nThe emulsion is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years \nonwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPrepandrix should be used in accordance with official guidance.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve \nmonths after the first dose for maximum efficacy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial population: \n \nBased on very limited data, adults aged >80 years may require a double dose of Prepandrix on an \nelected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune response \n(see section 5.1). \n \nA complete vaccination course with Prepandrix consists of two doses.  However, in the event of an \nofficially declared influenza pandemic, persons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of \nPrepandrix that contained HA antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza subtype as \nthe pandemic influenza strain may receive a single dose of Adjupanrix instead of two doses that are \nrequired in previously unvaccinated individuals. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Prepandrix in children aged less than 3 years and in children and \nadolescents aged 10 to 17 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nThere are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of an AS03-\nadjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and on \nadministration of half a dose of the vaccine (i.e. 1.875 µg HA and half the amount of AS03 adjuvant) \nat 0 and 21 days in children aged 3 to 9 years.  See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \nIf a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs. \n \nFor instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of \nthis vaccine. See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in subjects with a severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \nthiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate \nand sodium deoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nPrepandrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.  \nThere are no data with Prepandrix using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need \nto assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nEpidemiological studies relating to another AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Pandemrix H1N1, also \nmanufactured in the same facility as Prepandrix), in several European countries have indicated an \nincreased risk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated \nindividuals. In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional \n1.4 to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 \nyears have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data \nsuggest that the excess risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination. There is currently no \nevidence to indicate that Prepandrix may be associated with a risk of narcolepsy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical data in children less than 6 years of age who received two doses of pandemic preparedness or \nzoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) indicate an increase in frequency of fever (axillary≥38°C) after the \nadministration of the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the \nfever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young \nchildren (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) post-vaccination. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Prepandrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with \nanother vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are currently no data available on the use of Prepandrix in pregnancy. \n \nAn AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v has been administered to women in each \ntrimester of pregnancy. Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200,000 women who have \nbeen vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased risk of \nadverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study. \n \nAnimal studies with Prepandrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 do not indicate reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do \nnot suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nThe use of Prepandrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary taking \ninto account official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPrepandrix may be used in lactating women. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in approximately 5,000 subjects 18 \nyears old and above who received Prepandrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) strain with at \nleast 3.75 µg HA. \n \nIn adults 18 to 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were \ninjection site pain (76.6%), muscle aches (46.8%), fatigue (43.6%), headache (25.3%) and joint pain \n(13.5%). \n \nIn subjects > 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reaction after vaccination was \ninjection site pain (32.6%). \n \nIn clinical trials in which subjects (N=201) received Prepandrix containing 3.75 microgram HA/AS03 \nof A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) strain, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions were \ncomparable with those reported below. \n \nList of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: lymphadenopathy \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVery common: headache \nUncommon: paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: ecchymosis at the injection site, sweating increased \nUncommon: pruritus, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: arthralgia, myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: induration, swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, fever, fatigue,  \nCommon: shivering, influenza like illness, injection site reactions (such as warmth, pruritus)  \nUncommon: malaise \n \nNo post-marketing surveillance data are available following Prepandrix administration. \n \nFrom post-marketing experience with AS03-containing vaccines containing 3.75 µg HA derived from \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the following adverse reactions have been reported: \n \nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylaxis, allergic reactions \n \nNervous system disorders \nFebrile convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAngioedema, generalised skin reactions, urticaria \n \nIn addition, from post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following \nadverse reactions have been reported: \n \nRare:  \nNeuralgia, transient thrombocytopenia. \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA clinical study (D-H5N1-009) evaluated the reactogenicity in children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age \nwho received either two adult (i.e. 0.5 ml) doses or two half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) doses (21 days apart) \nof pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 manufactured in Dresden, Germany).  \n \nA difference in the frequency of local and general solicited adverse reactions between half adult and \nadult doses was observed after each dose.  The administration of a second half adult or an adult dose \ndid not enhance the reactogenicity, except for rates of general symptoms which were higher after the \nsecond dose, particularly for rates of fever in <6 year olds. The per-dose frequency of adverse \nreactions was as follows: \n \nAdverse reactions 3-5 years 6-9 years \n Half dose Full dose Half dose Full dose \nInduration 9.9% 18.6% 12.0% 12.2% \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPain 48.5% 62.9% 68.0% 73.5% \nRedness 10.9% 19.6% 13.0% 6.1% \nSwelling 11.9% 24.7% 14.0% 20.4% \nFever (>38°C) 4.0% 11.3% 2.0% 17.3% \nFever (>39°C) \n- per-dose \n\nfrequency \n- per-subject \n\nfrequency \n\n \n2.0% \n\n \n3.9% \n\n \n5.2% \n\n \n10.2% \n\n \n0% \n\n \n0% \n\n \n7.1% \n\n \n14.3% \n\nDrowsiness 7.9% 13.4% NA NA \nIrritability 7.9% 18.6% NA NA \nLoss of appetite 6.9% 16.5% NA NA \nShivering 1.0% 12.4% 4.0% 14.3% \nNA=not available \n \nIn other clinical studies where children 6 months to 17 years received Prepandrix, increases in the \nfrequency of some side effects (including injection site pain, redness and fever) were seen after the \nsecond dose in children aged less than 6 years. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the \nintra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous \nH5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected \nagainst the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper \nrespiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk \nof viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all \nanimals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of \nchallenge. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal and \npostnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). The reproductive toxicity studies have been \nconducted using Prepandrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.   \n \n \n6.

Chemical and physical in-use stability has \nbeen demonstrated for 24 hours at 25°C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after mixing of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nOne pack containing: \n- one pack of 50 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml suspension with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n- two packs of 25 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml emulsion with a stopper (butyl rubber).   \n \nThe volume after mixing 1 vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponds to \n10 doses of vaccine (5 ml). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPrepandrix consists of two containers:  \nSuspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,  \nEmulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.  \n \nPrior to administration, the two components should be mixed. \n \nInstructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine: \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken \nand inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. \nIn the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the \nvaccine. \n\n2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended \nto equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be \navailable, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained \nin upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.  \n\n3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other \nvariation being observed, discard the vaccine. \n\n4. The volume of the Prepandrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml.  The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). \n\n5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered \nintramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-\nG.  \n\n7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is \nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 \nminutes) before each withdrawal. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Prepandrix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Prepandrix \n3. How Prepandrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Prepandrix \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Prepandrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Prepandrix is and what it is used for \nPrepandrix is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 years old. It is intended to be given before or during \nthe next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nHow Prepandrix works \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease.  None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.  \n \nAs with all vaccines, Prepandrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Prepandrix \n \nPrepandrix should not be given: \n \n• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts such \nas: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or \nsodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n \n• if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be vaccinated with \nPrepandrix. \n\n \nDo not have Prepandrix if any of the above apply to you.   \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Prepandrix: \n \n• if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life threatening allergic reaction to any  \n\ningredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken \nprotein, ovalbumin formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. \n\n• if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be \npoor. \n\n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Prepandrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell \nthe doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Prepandrix. \n\n• if you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if \nyou fainted with a previous injection. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nPrepandrix.  This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. \n \nChildren \nIf your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after \nthe second dose, especially temperature over 38°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures \nto lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each \ndose are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Prepandrix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or \nhave recently received any other vaccine. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid \ntreatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system.  Prepandrix can still be given \nbut your response to the vaccine may be poor. \n \nPrepandrix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs \nto happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm.  Any side effects that happen may be \nmore serious. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you receive this vaccine \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome side effects listed in Section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect your ability to drive or use \ntools or machines. It is best to see how Prepandrix affects you before you try these activities. \n \nPrepandrix contains thiomersal  \nPrepandrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic \nreaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \nPrepandrix contains sodium and potassium  \nPrepandrix contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per \ndose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n3. How Prepandrix is given \n \n• From 18 years onwards: you will receive two doses of Prepandrix. The second dose should be \n\ngiven after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve months after the first dose. \n \n• From 80 years onwards:  you may receive two double injections of Prepandrix. The first two \n\ninjections should be given at the elected date and the two other injections should preferably be \ngiven 3 weeks after. \n\n \nUse in children \n \nIn a clinical study, children 3 to 9 years of age have received either two adult (0.5 ml) or two half adult \n(0.25 ml) doses of a similar vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  Your doctor will decide the \nappropriate dose for your child. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will give you Prepandrix. \n \n• They will give Prepandrix as an injection into a muscle. \n• This will usually be in the upper arm. \n• The double injections will be given in opposite arms. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions which may cause you to have dangerously low blood pressure.  If this is not treated \nit may lead to shock. Your doctors know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment \nready to use. \n \nOther side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Feeling tired \n• Headache \n• Pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump where the injection was given \n• Fever \n• Aching muscles, joint pain \n\n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• Warmth, itching or bruising where the injection was given \n• Increased sweating, shivering, flu-like symptoms \n• Swollen glands in your neck, armpit or groin \n \nUncommon: may affect upt o 1 in 100 people \n• Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet \n• Feeling dizzy \n• Sleepiness \n• Sleeplessness \n• Diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain, feeling sick \n• Itching, rash \n• Generally feeling unwell \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nAdditional side effects in children \n \nIn a clinical study, children 3 to 9 years of age have received either two adult (0.5 ml) or two half adult \n(0.25 ml) doses of a similar vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  The frequency of side effects \nwas lower in the group of children who received half of the adult dose.  There was no increase after \nthe second dose whether the children received half of the adult or the adult dose, except for some side \neffects which were higher after the second dose, particularly for rates of fever in < 6 years old \nchildren. \n \nIn other clinical studies where children 6 months to 17 years received Prepandrix, increases in the \nfrequency of some side effects (including injection site pain, redness and fever) were seen after the \nsecond dose in children aged less than 6 years. \n \nThe side effects listed below have happened with H1N1 AS03-containing vaccines. They may also \nhappen with Prepandrix. If any of the side effects below occur, please tell your doctor or nurse \nimmediately: \n \n• Allergic reactions leading to a dangerously low blood pressure. If this is not treated, it may lead \n\nto shock.  Your doctors will know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment \nready to use \n\n• Fits \n• Generalised skin reactions including urticaria (hives) \n \nThe side effects listed below have happened in the days or weeks after vaccination with other vaccines \ngiven routinely every year to prevent flu.  These side effects may also happen with Prepandrix. If any \nof the side effects below occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately: \n \nVery rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people \n• Problems with your brain and nerves such as inflammation of the central nervous system \n\n(encephalomyelitis), inflammation of nerves (neuritis) or a type of paralysis known as ‘Guillain-\nBarré Syndrome’. \n\n• Inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis).  This can cause skin rashes, joint pain and \nkidney problems \n\n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n• Serious stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \n• Low blood platelet count. This can cause bleeding or bruising  \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet.

Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken \nand inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. \nIn the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the \nvaccine. \n\n2.  The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended \nto equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be \navailable, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained \nin upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content. \n\n3.  After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other \nvariation being observed, discard the vaccine. \n\n4.  The volume of the Prepandrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 “How Prepandrix is \ngiven”). \n\n5.  The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n6.  Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered \nintramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-\nG.  \n\n7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is \n\n\n\n38 \n\nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 \nminutes) before each withdrawal. \n\n \nThe vaccine should not be administered intravascularly. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
