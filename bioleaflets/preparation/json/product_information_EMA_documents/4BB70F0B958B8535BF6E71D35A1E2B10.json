NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nKaletra (80 mg + 20 mg) / ml oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach 1 ml of Kaletra oral solution contains 80 mg of lopinavir co-formulated with 20 mg of ritonavir \nas a pharmacokinetic enhancer. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n \nEach 1 ml contains 356.3 mg of alcohol (42.4% v/v), 168.6 mg of high fructose corn syrup, 152.7 mg \nof propylene glycol (15.3% w/v) (see section 4.3), 10.2 mg of polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil and \n4.1 mg of acesulfame potassium (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nOral solution \n \nThe solution is light yellow to orange. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKaletra is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children aged from 14 days \nand older. \n \nThe choice of Kaletra to treat protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKaletra should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents  \nThe recommended dosage of Kaletra is 5 ml of oral solution (400/100 mg) twice daily taken with \nfood. \n \nPaediatric population aged from 14 days and older  \nThe oral solution formulation is the recommended option for the most accurate dosing in children \nbased on body surface area or body weight.  However, if it is judged necessary to resort to solid oral \ndosage form for children weighing less than 40 kg or with a BSA between 0.5 and 1.4 m2 and able to \nswallow tablets, Kaletra 100 mg/25 mg tablets may be used.  The adult dose of Kaletra tablets \n(400/100 mg twice daily) may be used in children 40 kg or greater or with a Body Surface Area \n(BSA)* greater than 1.4 m2.  Kaletra tablets are administered orally and must be swallowed whole and \nnot chewed, broken or crushed.  Please refer to the Kaletra 100 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets \nSummary of Product Characteristics. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nTotal amounts of alcohol and propylene glycol from all medicines, including Kaletra oral solution, that \nare to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDosage recommendation for paediatric patients aged from 14 days to 6 months \n \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines \n2 weeks to 6 months \n\nBased on weight \n(mg/kg) \n\nBased on BSA (mg/m2)* Frequency \n\n16/4 mg/kg \n(corresponding to 0.2 ml/kg) \n\n300/75 mg/m2 \n(corresponding to 3.75 ml/m2) \n\nGiven twice daily \nwith food \n\n*Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation \nBSA (m2) = √ (Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 3600) \n\n \nIt is recommended that Kaletra not be administered in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine in \npatients less than 6 months of age. \n \nDosage recommendation for paediatric patients older than 6 months to less than 18 years \n \nWithout Concomitant Efavirenz or Nevirapine \n \nThe following tables contain dosing guidelines for Kaletra oral solution based on body weight and \nBSA. \n \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines based on body weight* \n> 6 months to 18 years \n\nBody weight (kg) Twice daily oral solution dose  \n(dose in mg/kg) \n\nVolume of oral solution \ntwice daily taken with food \n\n(80 mg lopinavir/20 mg \nritonavir per ml)** \n\n7 to < 15 kg \n7 to 10 kg \n\n> 10 to < 15 kg \n\n12/3 mg/kg  \n1.25 ml \n1.75 ml \n\n≥ 15 to 40 kg \n15 to 20 kg \n\n> 20 to 25 kg \n> 25 to 30 kg \n> 30 to 35 kg \n> 35 to 40 kg \n\n10/2.5 mg/kg  \n2.25 ml \n2.75 ml \n3.50 ml \n4.00 ml \n4.75 ml \n\n≥ 40 kg See adult dosage recommendation \n *weight based dosing recommendations are based on limited data  \n ** the volume (ml) of oral solution represents the average dose for the weight range \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines for the dose 230/57.5 mg/m2 \n> 6 months to < 18 years \n\nBody Surface Area* (m2) Twice daily oral solution dose (dose in mg) \n\n0.25 0.7 ml (57.5/14.4 mg) \n0.40 1.2 ml (96/24 mg) \n0.50 1.4 ml (115/28.8 mg) \n0.75 2.2 ml (172.5/43.1 mg) \n0.80 2.3 ml (184/46 mg) \n1.00 2.9 ml (230/57.5 mg) \n1.25 3.6 ml (287.5/71.9 mg) \n1.3 3.7 ml (299/74.8 mg) \n1.4 4.0 ml (322/80.5 mg) \n1.5 4.3 ml (345/86.3 mg) \n1.7 5 ml (402.5/100.6 mg) \n\n *Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation \n BSA (m2) = √ (Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 3600) \n \nConcomitant Therapy: Efavirenz or Nevirapine \n \nThe 230/57.5 mg/m2 dosage might be insufficient in some children when co-administered with \nnevirapine or efavirenz.  An increase of the dose of Kaletra to 300/75 mg/m2 is needed in these \npatients.  The recommended dose of 533/133 mg or 6.5 ml twice daily should not be exceeded. \n \nChildren less than 14 days of age and premature neonates  \nKaletra oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of \nthe mother’s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 42 weeks and a \npostnatal age of at least 14 days has been reached (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment  \nIn HIV-infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, an increase of approximately 30% \nin lopinavir exposure has been observed but is not expected to be of clinical relevance (see section \n5.2).  No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Kaletra must not be given to \nthese patients (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment  \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nKaletra is administered orally and should always be taken with food (see section 5.2).  The dose \nshould be administered using a calibrated 2 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe best corresponding to the \nvolume prescribed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSevere hepatic insufficiency. \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A \nfor clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life \nthreatening events.  These medicinal products include: \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \n\nMedicinal product \nclass \n\nMedicinal products within \nclass \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased \n\nAlpha1-adrenoreceptor \nantagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of \nalfuzosin which may lead to severe \nhypotension.  The concomitant \nadministration with alfuzosin is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of \nranolazine which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, dronedarone Increased plasma concentrations of \namiodarone and dronedarone.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of arrhythmias or \nother serious adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic Acid Increased plasma concentrations of \nfusidic acid. The concomitant \nadministration with fusidic acid is \ncontraindicated in dermatological \ninfections (see section 4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of \nneratinib which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of \nvenetoclax.  Increased risk of tumor lysis \nsyndrome at the dose initiation and \nduring the ramp-up phase (see section \n4.5). \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Increased plasma concentrations of \ncolchicine.  Potential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions in patients with \nrenal and/or hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, terfenadine Increased plasma concentrations of \nastemizole and terfenadine.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of serious \narrhythmias from these agents (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAntipsychotics/ \nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of \nlurasidone which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nPimozide Increased plasma concentrations of \npimozide.  Thereby, increasing the risk \nof serious haematologic abnormalities, \nor other serious adverse effects from this \nagent (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nQuetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of \nquetiapine which may lead to coma.  The \nconcomitant administration with \nquetiapine is contraindicated (see section \n4.5). \n\nErgot alkaloids \n \n\nDihydroergotamine, ergonovine, \nergotamine, methylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of ergot \nderivatives leading to acute ergot \ntoxicity, including vasospasm and \nischaemia (see section 4.5). \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of \ncisapride.  Thereby, increasing the risk \nof serious arrhythmias from this agent \n(see section 4.5). \n\nHepatitis C virus \ndirect acting antivirals \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir Increased risk of alanine transaminase \n(ALT) elevations (see section 4.5). \n\nOmbitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwith or without dasabuvir \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nparitaprevir; thereby, increasing the risk \nof alanine transaminase (ALT) \nelevations (see section 4.5). \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \n\n \n\nHMG Co-A Reductase \nInhibitors \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of \nlovastatin and simvastatin; thereby, \nincreasing the risk of myopathy \nincluding rhabdomyolysis (see section \n4.5). \n\nMicrosomal \ntriglyceride transfer \nprotein (MTTP) \ninhibitor \n\nLomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of \nlomitapide (see section 4.5). \n\nPhosphodiesterase \n(PDE5) inhibitors \n\nAvanafil Increased plasma concentrations of \navanafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nSildenafil \n \n\nContraindicated when used for the \ntreatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only.  Increased \nplasma concentrations of sildenafil.  \nThereby, increasing the potential for \nsildenafil-associated adverse events \n(which include hypotension and \nsyncope).  See section 4.4 and section \n4.5 for co-administration of sildenafil in \npatients with erectile dysfunction. \n\nVardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of \nvardenafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Oral midazolam, triazolam Increased plasma concentrations of oral \nmidazolam and triazolam.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of extreme sedation \nand respiratory depression from these \nagents.   \nFor caution on parenterally administered \nmidazolam, see section 4.5. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal products St. John’s wort Herbal preparations containing St John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the \nrisk of decreased plasma concentrations \nand reduced clinical effects of lopinavir \nand ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \nKaletra oral solution is contraindicated in children below the age of 14 days, pregnant women, patients \nwith hepatic or renal failure and patients treated with disulfiram or metronidazole due to the potential \nrisk of toxicity from the excipient propylene glycol (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of Kaletra has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver \ndisorders.  Kaletra is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.3).  \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant \nantiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these \nmedicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.   \n \nElevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 \nmono-infected and in individuals treated for post-exposure prophylaxis as early as 7 days after the \ninitiation of lopinavir/ritonavir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents.  In some cases the \nhepatic dysfunction was serious. \n \nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir \nand close monitoring should be performed during treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nHaemophilia \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal \nrelationship had been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated.  \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nPancreatitis \nCases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, including those who developed \nhypertriglyceridaemia.  In most of these cases patients have had a prior history of pancreatitis and/or \nconcurrent therapy with other medicinal products associated with pancreatitis.  Marked triglyceride \nelevation is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis.  Patients with advanced HIV disease may be \nat risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \npancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \nKaletra therapy should be suspended if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). \n \nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPR interval prolongation  \nLopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in \nsome healthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with \nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \nreceiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported \nin patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra is likely to increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily \nmetabolised by CYP3A.  These increases of plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal \nproducts could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see sections 4.3 and \n4.5).  \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions.  Therefore, combination of \nbedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, \nco-administration of bedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline SmPC). \n \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (as lopinavir/ritonavir) may \nincrease exposure to delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nTherefore, if co-administration of delamanid with lopinavir/ritonavir is considered necessary, very \nfrequent ECG monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section \n4.5 and refer to the delamanid SmPC). \n \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir.  Concomitant administration with colchicine is \ncontraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with:  \n- tadalafil, indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is not recommended \n\n(see section 4.5); \n- riociguat is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- vorapaxar is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- fusidic acid in osteo-articular infections is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- salmeterol is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- rivaroxaban is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with atorvastatin is not recommended.  If the use of atorvastatin is \nconsidered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with \ncareful safety monitoring.  Caution must also be exercised and reduced doses should be considered if \nKaletra is used concurrently with rosuvastatin.  If treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is \nindicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors  \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving Kaletra.  Co-administration of Kaletra with these medicinal products \nis expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant \nuse of avanafil or vardenafil and lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant \nuse of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nParticular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT \ninterval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin.  Indeed, \nKaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in \nan increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions.  Cardiac events have been reported with \nKaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently \nruled out (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nCo-administration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended.  Rifampicin in combination with \nKaletra causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn significantly decrease the \nlopinavir therapeutic effect.  Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved when a higher \ndose of Kaletra is used but this is associated with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.  \nTherefore, this co-administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4, \nsuch as budesonide and triamcinolone, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment \noutweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal \nsuppression (see section 4.5). \n \nOther \n \nPatients taking the oral solution, particularly those with renal impairment or with decreased ability to \nmetabolise propylene glycol (e.g. those of Asian origin), should be monitored for adverse reactions \npotentially related to propylene glycol toxicity (i.e. seizures, stupor, tachycardia, hyperosmolarity, \nlactic acidosis, renal toxicity, haemolysis) (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nKaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.  While effective viral suppression with antiretroviral \ntherapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot \nbe excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national \nguidelines.  People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \ndisease and AIDS. \n \nBesides propylene glycol as described above, Kaletra oral solution contains alcohol (42% v/v) which \nis potentially harmful for those suffering from liver disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, brain injury or \ndisease as well as for pregnant women and children.  It may modify or increase the effects of other \nmedicines.  Kaletra oral solution contains up to 0.8 g of fructose per dose when taken according to the \ndosage recommendations.  This may be unsuitable in hereditary fructose intolerance.  Kaletra oral \nsolution contains up to 0.3 g of glycerol per dose.  Only at high inadvertent doses, it can cause \nheadache and gastrointestinal upset.  Furthermore, polyoxol 40 hydrogenated castor oil and potassium \npresent in Kaletra oral solution may cause only at high inadvertent doses gastrointestinal upset. \nPatients on a low potassium diet should be cautioned. \n \nParticular risk of toxicity in relation to the amount of alcohol and propylene glycol contained in \nKaletra oral solution \n \nHealthcare professionals should be aware that Kaletra oral solution is highly concentrated and contains \n42.4% alcohol (v/v) and 15.3% propylene glycol (w/v).   Each 1 ml of Kaletra oral solution contains \n356.3 mg of alcohol and 152.7 mg of propylene glycol.    \n \nSpecial attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of Kaletra, transcription of the \nmedication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication \nerrors and overdose.  This is especially important for infants and young children.   \n \nTotal amounts of alcohol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants \nshould be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients.  Infants should be \nmonitored closely for toxicity related to Kaletra oral solution including: hyperosmolality, with or \nwithout lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, central nervous system (CNS) depression (including stupor, \ncoma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes, and hemolysis.  \nPostmarketing life-threatening cases of cardiac toxicity (including complete atrioventricular (AV) \nblock, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression and \nrespiratory complications leading to death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates \nreceiving Kaletra oral solution (see sections 4.3 and 4.9).  \n \nBased on the findings in a paediatric study (observed exposures were approximately 35% AUC12 and \n75% lower Cmin than in adults), young children from 14 days to 3 months could have sub-optimal \nexposure with a potential risk of inadequate virologic suppression and emergence of resistance (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nBecause Kaletra oral solution contains alcohol, it is not recommended for use with polyurethane \nfeeding tubes due to potential incompatibility. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A \nin vitro.  Co-administration of Kaletra and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may \nresult in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or \nprolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions.  Kaletra does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nKaletra has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of \nsome medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP2C9 and \nCYP2C19) and by glucuronidation.  This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and potential \ndecrease of efficacy of co-administered medicinal products. \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n \nMedicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction \nand potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3. \n \nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below.  This list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  \nIndividual SmPCs should be consulted. \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between Kaletra and co-administered medicinal products are

of \ndigoxin concentrations, if \navailable, is recommended in case \nof co-administration of Kaletra \nand digoxin.  Particular caution \nshould be used when prescribing \nKaletra in patients taking digoxin \nas the acute inhibitory effect of \nritonavir on P-gp is expected to \nsignificantly increase digoxin \nlevels.  Initiation of digoxin in \npatients already taking Kaletra is \nlikely to result in lower than \nexpected increases of digoxin \nconcentrations. \n\nBepridil, Systemic \nLidocaine, and Quinidine  \n\nBepridil, Systemic Lidocaine, \nQuinidine:  \nConcentrations may be increased \nwhen co-administered with \nlopinavir/ritonavir.  \n\nCaution is warranted and \ntherapeutic drug concentration \nmonitoring is recommended when \navailable. \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nAntibiotics \nClarithromycin Clarithromycin:  \n\nModerate increases in \nclarithromycin AUC are expected \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir.  \n \n\nFor patients with renal impairment \n(CrCL < 30 ml/min) dose \nreduction of clarithromycin should \nbe considered (see section 4.4).  \nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering clarithromycin with \nKaletra to patients with impaired \nhepatic or renal function. \n\nAnticancer agents and kinase inhibitors \nAbemaciclib  Serum concentrations may be \n\nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of abemaciclib \nand Kaletra should be avoided.  If \nthis co-administration is judged \nunavoidable, refer to the \nabemaciclib SmPC for dosage \nadjustment recommendations.  \nMonitor for ADRs related to \nabemaciclib. \n\nApalutamide Apalutamide is a moderate to \nstrong CYP3A4 inducer and this \nmay lead to a decreased exposure \nof lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nSerum concentrations of \napalutamide may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nDecreased exposure of Kaletra \nmay result in potential loss of \nvirological response.   \nIn addition, co-administration of \napalutamide and Kaletra may lead \nto serious adverse events \nincluding seizure due to higher \napalutamide levels.  Concomitant \nuse of Kaletra with apalutamide is \nnot recommended. \n\nAfatinib \n \n(Ritonavir 200 mg twice \ndaily) \n\nAfatinib: \nAUC: ↑  \nCmax: ↑ \n \nThe extent of increase depends on \nthe timing of ritonavir \nadministration. \n \nDue to BCRP (breast cancer \nresistance protein/ABCG2) and \nacute P-gp inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering afatinib with \nKaletra.  Refer to the afatinib \nSmPC for dosage adjustment \nrecommendations.  Monitor for \nADRs related to afatinib. \n\nCeritinib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A and \nP-gp inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering ceritinib with \nKaletra.  Refer to the ceritinib \nSmPC for dosage adjustment \nrecommendations.  Monitor for \nADRs related to ceritinib. \n\nMost tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors such as dasatinib \nand nilotinib, vincristine, \nvinblastine \n\nMost tyrosine kinase inhibitors \nsuch as dasatinib and nilotinib, \nalso vincristine and vinblastine: \nRisk of increased adverse events \ndue to higher serum \nconcentrations because of \nCYP3A4 inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCareful monitoring of the \ntolerance of these anticancer \nagents. \n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nEncorafenib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of encorafenib \nwith Kaletra may increase \nencorafenib exposure which may \nincrease the risk of toxicity, \nincluding the risk of serious \nadverse events such as QT interval \nprolongation.  Co-administration \nof encorafenib and Kaletra should \nbe avoided.  If the benefit is \nconsidered to outweigh the risk \nand Kaletra must be used, patients \nshould be carefully monitored for \nsafety. \n\nFostamatinib Increase in fostamatinib \nmetabolite R406 exposure. \n\nCo-administration of fostamatinib \nwith Kaletra may increase \nfostamatinib metabolite R406 \nexposure resulting in dose-related \nadverse events such as \nhepatotoxicity, neutropenia, \nhypertension, or diarrhoea.  Refer \nto the fostamatinib SmPC for dose \nreduction recommendations if \nsuch events occur. \n\nIbrutinib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of ibrutinib and \nKaletra may increase ibrutinib \nexposure which may increase the \nrisk of toxicity including risk of \ntumor lysis syndrome. \nCo-administration of ibrutinib and \nKaletra should be avoided.  If the \nbenefit is considered to outweigh \nthe risk and Kaletra must be used, \nreduce the ibrutinib dose to \n140 mg and monitor patient \nclosely for toxicity. \n\nNeratinib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant use of neratinib with \nKaletra is contraindicated due to \nserious and/or life-threatening \npotential reactions including \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.3). \n\nVenetoclax Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir, \nresulting in increased risk of \ntumor lysis syndrome at the dose \ninitiation and during the ramp-up \nphase (see section 4.3 and refer to \nthe venetoclax SmPC). \n \nFor patients who have completed \nthe ramp-up phase and are on a \nsteady daily dose of venetoclax, \nreduce the venetoclax dose by at \nleast 75% when used with strong \nCYP3A inhibitors (refer to the \nvenetoclax SmPC for dosing \ninstructions).  Patients should be \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nclosely monitored for signs related \nto venetoclax toxicities. \n\nAnticoagulants \nWarfarin \n \n \n \n\nWarfarin: \nConcentrations may be affected \nwhen co-administered with \nlopinavir/ritonavir due to \nCYP2C9 induction.   \n\nIt is recommended that INR \n(international normalised ratio) be \nmonitored. \n \n\nRivaroxaban \n \n(Ritonavir 600 mg twice \ndaily) \n\nRivaroxaban:   \nAUC: ↑ 153%  \nCmax: ↑ 55% \nDue to CYP3A and P-gp \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of rivaroxaban \nand Kaletra may increase \nrivaroxaban exposure which may \nincrease the risk of bleeding. \nThe use of rivaroxaban is not \nrecommended in patients \nreceiving concomitant treatment \nwith Kaletra (see section 4.4). \n\nVorapaxar Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe co-administration of \nvorapaxar with Kaletra is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the vorapaxar SmPC). \n\nAnticonvulsants \nPhenytoin \n \n\nPhenytoin: \nSteady-state concentrations was \nmoderately decreased due to \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 induction \nby lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nLopinavir:   \nConcentrations are decreased due \nto CYP3A induction by \nphenytoin.   \n \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering phenytoin with \nKaletra. \n \nPhenytoin levels should be \nmonitored when co-administering \nwith Kaletra. \n \nWhen co-administered with \nphenytoin, an increase of Kaletra \ndosage may be envisaged.

The combination \nshould be used with caution and a \nlower dose of trazodone should be \nconsidered. \n \n\nAntifungals \nKetoconazole and \nItraconazole \n\nKetoconazole, Itraconazole: \nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n\nHigh doses of ketoconazole and \nitraconazole (> 200 mg/day) are \nnot recommended. \n\nVoriconazole Voriconazole:  \nConcentrations may be decreased. \n \n\nCo-administration of voriconazole \nand low dose ritonavir (100 mg \nBID) as contained in Kaletra \nshould be avoided unless an \nassessment of the benefit/risk to \npatient justifies the use of \nvoriconazole. \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nAnti-gout agents \nColchicine single dose \n \n(Ritonavir 200 mg twice \ndaily) \n\nColchicine: \nAUC: ↑ 3-fold \nCmax: ↑ 1.8-fold \nDue to P-gp and/or CYP3A4 \ninhibition by ritonavir. \n \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra with colchicine in patients \nwith renal and/or hepatic \nimpairment is contraindicated due \nto a potential increase of \ncolchicine-related serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions such as \nneuromuscular toxicity (including \nrhabdomyolysis) (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4).  A reduction in \ncolchicine dosage or an \ninterruption of colchicine \ntreatment is recommended in \npatients with normal renal or \nhepatic function if treatment with \nKaletra is required.  Refer to \ncolchicine prescribing \ninformation. \n\nAntihistamines \nAstemizole \nTerfenadine \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and astemizole and \nterfenadine is contraindicated as it \nmay increase the risk of serious \narrhythmias from these agents \n(see section 4.3). \n\nAnti-infectives \nFusidic acid Fusidic acid: \n\nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra with fusidic acid is contra-\nindicated in dermatological \nindications due to the increased \nrisk of adverse events related to \nfusidic acid, notably \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).  \nWhen used for osteo-articular \ninfections, where the co-\nadministration is unavoidable, \nclose clinical monitoring for \nmuscular adverse events is \nstrongly recommended (see section \n4.4).  \n\nAntimycobacterials \nBedaquiline \n(single dose) \n \n(Lopinavir/ritonavir \n400/100 mg BID, multiple \ndose) \n\nBedaquiline: \nAUC: ↑ 22% \nCmax: ↔ \n \nA more pronounced effect on \nbedaquiline plasma exposures \nmay be observed during \nprolonged co-administration with \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibition likely due to \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nDue to the risk of bedaquiline \nrelated adverse events, the \ncombination of bedaquiline and \nKaletra should be avoided.  If the \nbenefit outweighs the risk, \nco-administration of bedaquiline \nwith Kaletra must be done with \ncaution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and \nmonitoring of transaminases is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline SmPC). \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nDelamanid (100 mg BID) \n \n(Lopinavir/ritonavir \n400/100 mg BID) \n\nDelamanid: \nAUC: ↑ 22% \n \nDM-6705 (delamanid active \nmetabolite): \nAUC: ↑ 30% \n \nA more pronounced effect on \nDM-6705 exposure may be \nobserved during prolonged co-\nadministration with \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nDue to the risk of QTc prolongation \nassociated with DM-6705, if \nco-administration of delamanid \nwith Kaletra is considered \nnecessary, very frequent ECG \nmonitoring throughout the full \ndelamanid treatment period is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the delamanid SmPC). \n\nRifabutin, 150 mg QD \n \n\nRifabutin (parent drug and active \n25-O-desacetyl metabolite):  \nAUC: ↑ 5.7-fold \nCmax: ↑ 3.5-fold  \n \n \n\nWhen given with Kaletra the \nrecommended dose of rifabutin is \n150 mg 3 times per week on set \ndays (for example Monday-\nWednesday-Friday).  Increased \nmonitoring for rifabutin-associated \nadverse reactions including \nneutropenia and uveitis is \nwarranted due to an expected \nincrease in exposure to rifabutin.  \nFurther dosage reduction of \nrifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly \non set days is recommended for \npatients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 \ntimes per week is not tolerated.  It \nshould be kept in mind that the \ntwice weekly dosage of 150 mg \nmay not provide an optimal \nexposure to rifabutin thus leading to \na risk of rifamycin resistance and a \ntreatment failure.  No dose \nadjustment is needed for Kaletra.  \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nRifampicin Lopinavir: \nLarge decreases in lopinavir \nconcentrations may be observed \ndue to CYP3A induction by \nrifampicin. \n \n \n\nCo-administration of Kaletra with \nrifampicin is not recommended as \nthe decrease in lopinavir \nconcentrations may in turn \nsignificantly decrease the lopinavir \ntherapeutic effect.  A dose \nadjustment of Kaletra \n400 mg/400 mg (i.e. Kaletra \n400/100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg) \ntwice daily has allowed \ncompensating for the CYP 3A4 \ninducer effect of rifampicin.  \nHowever, such a dose adjustment \nmight be associated with ALT/AST \nelevations and with increase in \ngastrointestinal disorders.  \nTherefore, this co-administration \nshould be avoided unless judged \nstrictly necessary.  If this \nco-administration is judged \nunavoidable, increased dose of \nKaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice \ndaily may be administered with \nrifampicin under close safety and \ntherapeutic drug monitoring.  The \nKaletra dose should be titrated \nupward only after rifampicin has \nbeen initiated (see section 4.4). \n\nAntipsychotics \nLurasidone Due to CYP3A inhibition by \n\nlopinavir/ritonavir, \nconcentrations of lurasidone are \nexpected to increase. \n\nThe concomitant administration \nwith lurasidone is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n\nPimozide Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, \nconcentrations of pimozide are \nexpected to increase. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and pimozide is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nthe risk of serious haematologic \nabnormalities or other serious \nadverse effects from this agent (see \nsection 4.3) \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, \nconcentrations of quetiapine are \nexpected to increase. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and quetiapine is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nquetiapine-related toxicity. \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nBenzodiazepines \nMidazolam \n \n\nOral Midazolam:  \nAUC: ↑ 13-fold  \nParenteral Midazolam: \nAUC: ↑ 4-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir \n \n \n\nKaletra must not be co-administered \nwith oral midazolam (see section \n4.3), whereas caution should be \nused with co-administration of \nKaletra and parenteral midazolam.  \nIf Kaletra is co-administered with \nparenteral midazolam, it should be \ndone in an intensive care unit (ICU) \nor similar setting which ensures \nclose clinical monitoring and \nappropriate medical management in \ncase of respiratory depression \nand/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage \nadjustment for midazolam should be \nconsidered especially if more than a \nsingle dose of midazolam is \nadministered. \n\nBeta2-adrenoceptor agonist (long acting) \nSalmeterol Salmeterol: \n\nConcentrations are expected to \nincrease due to CYP3A inhibition \nby lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe combination may result in \nincreased risk of cardiovascular \nadverse events associated with \nsalmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and \nsinus tachycardia. \nTherefore, concomitant \nadministration of Kaletra with \nsalmeterol is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). \n\nCalcium channel blockers \nFelodipine, Nifedipine, and \nNicardipine \n\nFelodipine, Nifedipine, \nNicardipine: \nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nClinical monitoring of therapeutic \nand adverse effects is \nrecommended when these \nmedicines are concomitantly \nadministered with Kaletra. \n\nCorticosteroids \nDexamethasone Lopinavir: \n\nConcentrations may be decreased \ndue to CYP3A induction by \ndexamethasone. \n \n\nClinical monitoring of antiviral \nefficacy is recommended when \nthese medicines are concomitantly \nadministered with Kaletra. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nInhaled, injectable or \nintranasal fluticasone \npropionate, budesonide, \ntriamcinolone \n\nFluticasone propionate, 50 µg \nintranasal 4 times daily: \nPlasma concentrations ↑ \nCortisol levels ↓ 86%  \n \n\nGreater effects may be expected \nwhen fluticasone propionate is \ninhaled.  Systemic corticosteroid \neffects including Cushing's \nsyndrome and adrenal suppression \nhave been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or \nintranasally administered \nfluticasone propionate; this could \nalso occur with other \ncorticosteroids metabolised via the \nP450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide \nand triamcinolone.  Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of \nKaletra and these glucocorticoids \nis not recommended unless the \npotential benefit of treatment \noutweighs the risk of systemic \ncorticosteroid effects (see section \n4.4).  A dose reduction of the \nglucocorticoid should be \nconsidered with close monitoring \nof local and systemic effects or a \nswitch to a glucocorticoid, which \nis not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone).  Moreover, in \ncase of withdrawal of \nglucocorticoids progressive dose \nreduction may have to be \nperformed over a longer period.   \n\nPhosphodiesterase(PDE5) inhibitors \nAvanafil \n(ritonavir 600 mg BID)  \n\nAvanafil: \nAUC: ↑ 13-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nThe use of avanafil with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nTadalafil  \n \n \n\nTadalafil: \nAUC: ↑ 2-fold \nDue to CYP3A4 inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nFor the treatment of pulmonary \narterial hypertension: \nCo-administration of Kaletra with \nsildenafil is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).  Co-administration of \nKaletra with tadalafil is not \nrecommended. \n \nFor erectile dysfunction: \nParticular caution must be used \nwhen prescribing sildenafil or \ntadalafil in patients receiving \nKaletra with increased monitoring \nfor adverse events including \nhypotension, syncope, visual \nchanges and prolonged erection \n(see section 4.4).   \nWhen co-administered with \nKaletra, sildenafil doses must not \nexceed 25 mg in 48 hours and \ntadalafil doses must not exceed \n10 mg every 72 hours \n \n\nSildenafil \n \n \n\nSildenafil:  \nAUC: ↑ 11-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nVardenafil  \n \n \n\nVardenafil: \nAUC: ↑ 49-fold  \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe use of vardenafil with Kaletra \nis contraindicated (see section 4.3).   \n \n\nErgot alkaloids \nDihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, ergotamine, \nmethylergonovine \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and ergot alkaloids are \ncontraindicated as it may lead to \nacute ergot toxicity, including \nvasospasm and ischaemia (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nGI motility agent \nCisapride Serum concentrations may be \n\nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and cisapride is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nthe risk of serious arrhythmias \nfrom this agent (see section 4.3). \n\nHCV direct acting antivirals \nElbasvir/grazoprevir \n(50/200 mg QD) \n\n Elbasvir: \nAUC: ↑ 2.71-fold \nCmax: ↑ 1.87-fold \nC24: ↑ 3.58-fold \n \nGrazoprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 11.86-fold \nCmax: ↑ 6.31-fold \nC24: ↑ 20.70-fold \n \n(combinations of mechanisms \nincluding CYP3A inhibition) \n \nLopinavir: ↔ \n\nConcomitant administration of \nelbasvir/grazoprevir with Kaletra \nis contraindicated (see section \n4.3). \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to P-glycoprotein, \nBCRP and OATP1B inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir and \nKaletra is not recommended due \nto an increased risk of ALT \nelevations associated with \nincreased glecaprevir exposure. \n\nOmbitasvir/paritaprevir/rito\nnavir + dasabuvir \n \n(25/150/100 mg QD + \n400 mg BID) \n \nLopinavir/ritonavir  \n400/100 mg BID \n\nOmbitasvir: ↔  \n \nParitaprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 2.17-fold \nCmax: ↑ 2.04-fold \nCtrough: ↑ 2.36-fold \n \n(inhibition of CYP3A/efflux \ntransporters) \n \nDasabuvir: ↔ \n \nLopinavir: ↔ \n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated. \n \nLopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg \nQD was administered with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwith or without dasabuvir.

However, \nonly the increase in voxilaprevir \nexposure is considered clinically \nrelevant. \n\nIt is not recommended to \nco-administer Kaletra and \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ \nvoxilaprevir. \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \nSimeprevir 200 mg daily \n(ritonavir 100 mg BID) \n \n\nSimeprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 7.2-fold \nCmax: ↑ 4.7-fold \nCmin: ↑ 14.4-fold \n\nIt is not recommended to \nco-administer Kaletra and \nsimeprevir. \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nHerbal products \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) \n\nLopinavir: \nConcentrations may be reduced \ndue to induction of CYP3A by the \nherbal preparation St John’s wort.   \n \n\nHerbal preparations containing St \nJohn’s wort must not be combined \nwith lopinavir and ritonavir.  If a \npatient is already taking St John’s \nwort, stop St John’s wort and if \npossible check viral levels.  \nLopinavir and ritonavir levels may \nincrease on stopping \nSt John’s wort.  The dose of \nKaletra may need adjusting.  The \ninducing effect may persist for at \nleast 2 weeks after cessation of \ntreatment with St John’s wort (see \nsection 4.3).  Therefore, Kaletra \ncan be started safely 2 weeks after \ncessation of St John's wort.   \n\nImmunosuppressants \nCyclosporin, Sirolimus \n(rapamycin), and \nTacrolimus \n\nCyclosporin, Sirolimus \n(rapamycin), Tacrolimus:  \nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nMore frequent therapeutic \nconcentration monitoring is \nrecommended until plasma levels \nof these products have been \nstabilised. \n\nLipid lowering agents \nLovastatin and Simvastatin Lovastatin, Simvastatin: \n\nMarkedly increased plasma \nconcentrations due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nSince increased concentrations of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \nmay cause myopathy, including \nrhabdomyolysis, the combination \nof these agents with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nLipid-modifying agents \nLomitapide CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the \n\nexposure of lomitapide, with \nstrong inhibitors increasing \nexposure approximately 27-fold.  \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof lomitapide are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant use of Kaletra with \nlomitapide is contraindicated (see \nprescribing information for \nlomitapide) (see section 4.3). \n\nAtorvastatin Atorvastatin: \nAUC: ↑ 5.9-fold  \nCmax: ↑ 4.7-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe combination of Kaletra with \natorvastatin is not recommended.  \nIf the use of atorvastatin is \nconsidered strictly necessary, the \nlowest possible dose of \natorvastatin should be \nadministered with careful safety \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).   \n\nRosuvastatin, 20 mg QD \n \n\nRosuvastatin: \nAUC: ↑ 2-fold  \nCmax: ↑ 5-fold \nWhile rosuvastatin is poorly \nmetabolised by CYP3A4, an \nincrease of its plasma \nconcentrations was observed.  \nThe mechanism of this interaction \nmay result from inhibition of \ntransport proteins. \n\nCaution should be exercised and \nreduced doses should be \nconsidered when Kaletra is \nco-administered with rosuvastatin \n(see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nFluvastatin or Pravastatin Fluvastatin, Pravastatin:  \nNo clinical relevant interaction \nexpected. \nPravastatin is not metabolised by \nCYP450. \nFluvastatin is partially \nmetabolised by CYP2C9. \n\nIf treatment with an HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitor is indicated, \nfluvastatin or pravastatin is \nrecommended. \n\nOpioids \nBuprenorphine, 16 mg QD Buprenorphine: ↔ \n\n \nNo dose adjustment necessary. \n \n\nMethadone \n \n\nMethadone: ↓ \n \n\nMonitoring plasma concentrations \nof methadone is recommended. \n\nOral contraceptives \nEthinyl Oestradiol Ethinyl Oestradiol: ↓ \n\n \nIn case of co-administration of \nKaletra with contraceptives \ncontaining ethinyl oestradiol \n(whatever the contraceptive \nformulation e.g. oral or patch), \nadditional methods of \ncontraception must be used. \n\nSmoking cessation aids \nBupropion Buproprion and its active \n\nmetabolite, hydroxybupropion: \nAUC and Cmax ↓ ~50%  \n \nThis effect may be due to \ninduction of bupropion \nmetabolism. \n \n\nIf the co-administration of Kaletra \nwith bupropion is judged \nunavoidable, this should be done \nunder close clinical monitoring for \nbupropion efficacy, without \nexceeding the recommended \ndosage, despite the observed \ninduction. \n\nThyroid hormone replacement therapy \nLevothyroxine Post-marketing cases have been \n\nreported indicating a potential \ninteraction between ritonavir \ncontaining products and \nlevothyroxine. \n\nThyroid-stimulating hormone \n(TSH) should be monitored in \npatients treated with levothyroxine \nat least the first month after \nstarting and/or ending \nlopinavir/ritonavir treatment. \n\nVasodilating agents \nBosentan Lopinavir -

The prevalence of birth defects after any \ntrimester exposure to lopinavir is comparable to the prevalence observed in the general population.  \nNo pattern of birth defects suggestive of a common etiology was seen.  Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Based on the data mentioned, the malformative risk is unlikely \nin humans.  Lopinavir can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nBreastfeeding \nStudies in rats revealed that lopinavir is excreted in the milk.  It is not known whether this medicinal \nproduct is excreted in human milk.  As a general rule, it is recommended that mothers infected by HIV \ndo not breastfeed their babies under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.  \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown no effects on fertility.  No human data on the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir \non fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Patients \nshould be informed that nausea has been reported during treatment with Kaletra (see section 4.8). \n \nKaletra oral solution contains approximately 42% v/v alcohol.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Kaletra has been investigated in over 2600 patients in Phase II-IV clinical trials, of \nwhich over 700 have received a dose of 800/200 mg (6 capsules or 4 tablets) once daily.  Along with \nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, Kaletra was used in combination \nwith efavirenz or nevirapine.   \n \nThe most common adverse reactions related to Kaletra therapy during clinical trials were diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia.  Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting \nmay occur at the beginning of the treatment while hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia \nmay occur later.  Treatment emergent adverse events led to premature study discontinuation for 7% of \nsubjects from Phase II-IV studies.  \n \nIt is important to note that cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, \nincluding those who developed hypertriglyceridaemia.  Furthermore, rare increases in PR interval have \nbeen reported during Kaletra therapy (see section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult and paediatric patients: \nThe following events have been identified as adverse reactions.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nCushing’s syndrome has been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally \nadministered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via \nthe P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide (see section 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nIncreased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been \nreported with protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nd. Paediatric populations \n \nIn children 14 days of age and older, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults \n(see Table in section b).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nTo date, there is limited human experience of acute overdose with Kaletra. \n \nOverdoses with Kaletra oral solution have been reported (including fatal outcome).  The following \nevents have been reported in association with unintended overdoses in preterm neonates: complete \natrioventricular block, cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure.   \n \nThe adverse clinical signs observed in dogs included salivation, emesis and diarrhoea/abnormal stool.  \nThe signs of toxicity observed in mice, rats or dogs included decreased activity, ataxia, emaciation, \ndehydration and tremors.  \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Kaletra.  Treatment of overdose with Kaletra is to \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance is to be achieved \nby emesis or gastric lavage.  Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal \nof unabsorbed active substance.  Since Kaletra is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance. \n \nHowever, dialysis can remove both alcohol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with Kaletra \noral solution. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR10  \n \nMechanism of action \nLopinavir provides the antiviral activity of Kaletra.  Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 \nproteases.  Inhibition of HIV protease prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein resulting in the \nproduction of immature, non-infectious virus.  \n \nEffects on the electrocardiogram \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 39 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF from placebo were 3.6 (6.3) and \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 31 \n\n13.1(15.8) for 400/100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800/200 mg twice daily LPV/r, \nrespectively.  The induced QRS interval prolongation from 6 ms to 9.5 ms with high dose \nlopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg twice daily) contributes to QT prolongation.  The two regimens \nresulted in exposures on Day 3 which were approximately 1.5 and 3-fold higher than those observed \nwith recommended once daily or twice daily LPV/r doses at steady state.  No subject experienced an \nincrease in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically \nrelevant threshold of 500 ms. \n \nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in the \nsame study on Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.6 ms to 24.4 ms \nin the 12 hour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 286 ms and no second or third degree \nheart block was observed (see section 4.4). \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against laboratory and clinical HIV strains was evaluated in \nacutely infected lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, respectively.  In the \nabsence of human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against five different HIV-1 laboratory strains \nwas 19 nM.  In the absence and presence of 50% human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against \nHIV-1IIIB in MT4 cells was 17 nM and 102 nM, respectively.  In the absence of human serum, the \nmean IC50 of lopinavir was 6.5 nM against several HIV-1 clinical isolates. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro selection of resistanceHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been \nselected in vitro.  HIV-1 has been passaged in vitro with lopinavir alone and with lopinavir plus \nritonavir at concentration ratios representing the range of plasma concentration ratios observed during \nKaletra therapy.  Genotypic and phenotypic analysis of viruses selected in these passages suggest that \nthe presence of ritonavir, at these concentration ratios, does not measurably influence the selection of \nlopinavir-resistant viruses.  Overall, the in vitro characterisation of phenotypic cross-resistance \nbetween lopinavir and other protease inhibitors suggest that decreased susceptibility to lopinavir \ncorrelated closely with decreased susceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did not correlate closely \nwith decreased susceptibility to amprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in ARV-naïve patients   \nIn clinical studies with a limited number of isolates analysed, the selection of resistance to lopinavir \nhas not been observed in naïve patients without significant protease inhibitor resistance at baseline.  \nSee further the detailed description of the clinical studies. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in PI-experienced patients \nThe selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was \ncharacterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in \n2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral \nrebound subsequent to initial response to Kaletra and who demonstrated incremental in vitro resistance \nbetween baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in phenotypic \nsusceptibility to lopinavir).  Incremental resistance was most common in subjects whose baseline \nisolates had several protease inhibitor-associated mutations, but < 40-fold reduced susceptibility to \nlopinavir at baseline.  Mutations V82A, I54V and M46I emerged most frequently.  Mutations L33F, \nI50V and V32I combined with I47V/A were also observed.  The 19 isolates demonstrated a 4.3-fold \nincrease in IC50 compared to baseline isolates (from 6.2- to 43-fold, compared to wild-type virus). \n \nGenotypic correlates of reduced phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir in viruses selected by other \nprotease inhibitors.  The in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against 112 clinical isolates taken from \npatients failing therapy with one or more protease inhibitors was assessed.  Within this panel, the \nfollowing mutations in HIV protease were associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir: \nL10F/I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, M46I/L, F53L, I54L/T/V, L63P, A71I/L/T/V, V82A/F/T, I84V and \nL90M.  The median EC50 of lopinavir against isolates with 0 − 3, 4 − 5, 6 − 7 and 8 − 10 mutations at \nthe above amino acid positions was 0.8, 2.7 13.5 and 44.0-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nHIV, respectively.  The 16 viruses that displayed > 20-fold change in susceptibility all contained \nmutations at positions 10, 54, 63 plus 82 and/or 84.  In addition, they contained a median of \n3 mutations at amino acid positions 20, 24, 46, 53, 71 and 90.  In addition to the mutations described \nabove, mutations V32I and I47A have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir \nsusceptibility from protease inhibitor experienced patients receiving Kaletra therapy, and mutations \nI47A and L76V have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir susceptibility from \npatients receiving Kaletra therapy. \n \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nAntiviral activity of Kaletra in patients failing protease inhibitor therapy  \nThe clinical relevance of reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir has been examined by assessing \nthe virologic response to Kaletra therapy, with respect to baseline viral genotype and phenotype, in 56 \npatients previous failing therapy with multiple protease inhibitors.  The EC50 of lopinavir against the \n56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0.6 to 96-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type HIV.  After \n48 weeks of treatment with Kaletra, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma \nHIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml was observed in 93% (25/27), 73% (11/15), and 25% (2/8) of patients with \n< 10-fold, 10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively.  In \naddition, virologic response was observed in 91% (21/23), 71% (15/21) and 33% (2/6) patients with \n0 − 5, 6 − 7, and 8 − 10 mutations of the above mutations in HIV protease associated with reduced \nin vitro susceptibility to lopinavir.  Since these patients had not previously been exposed to either \nKaletra or efavirenz, part of the response may be attributed to the antiviral activity of efavirenz, \nparticularly in patients harbouring highly lopinavir resistant virus.  The study did not contain a control \narm of patients not receiving Kaletra. \n \nCross-resistance \nActivity of other protease inhibitors against isolates that developed incremental resistance to lopinavir \nafter Kaletra therapy in protease inhibitor experienced patients: The presence of cross resistance to \nother protease inhibitors was analysed in 18 rebound isolates that had demonstrated evolution of \nresistance to lopinavir during 3 Phase II and one Phase III studies of Kaletra in protease inhibitor-\nexperienced patients.  The median fold IC50 of lopinavir for these 18 isolates at baseline and rebound \nwas 6.9- and 63-fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  In general, rebound isolates either \nretained (if cross-resistant at baseline) or developed significant cross-resistance to indinavir, \nsaquinavir and atazanavir.  Modest decreases in amprenavir activity were noted with a median \nincrease of IC50 from 3.7- to 8-fold in the baseline and rebound isolates, respectively.  Isolates retained \nsusceptibility to tipranavir with a median increase of IC50 in baseline and rebound isolates of 1.9- and \n1.8–fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  Please refer to the Aptivus Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for additional information on the use of tipranavir, including genotypic predictors of \nresponse, in treatment of lopinavir-resistant HIV-1 infection.   \n \nClinical results \nThe effects of Kaletra (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers (plasma \nHIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts) have been investigated in controlled studies of Kaletra of \n48 to 360 weeks duration.   \n \nAdult Use \n \nPatients without prior antiretroviral therapy \n \nStudy M98-863 was a randomised, double-blind trial of 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients \ninvestigating Kaletra (400/100 mg twice daily) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) plus \nstavudine and lamivudine.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 259 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to \n949 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.9 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to \n6.8 log10 copies/ml).   \n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nTable 1 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 48: Study M98-863 \n\n Kaletra (N=326) Nelfinavir (N=327) \nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml* 75% 63% \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml*† 67% 52% \nMean increase from baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n207 195 \n\n* intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures  \n† p < 0.001 \n\n \nOne-hundred thirteen nelfinavir-treated patients and 74 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients had an HIV \nRNA above 400 copies/ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96.  Of these, isolates \nfrom 96 nelfinavir-treated patients and 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients could be amplified for \nresistance testing.  Resistance to nelfinavir, defined as the presence of the D30N or L90M mutation in \nprotease, was observed in 41/96 (43%) patients.  Resistance to lopinavir, defined as the presence of \nany primary or active site mutations in protease (see above), was observed in 0/51 (0%) patients.  Lack \nof resistance to lopinavir was confirmed by phenotypic analysis. \n \nSustained virological response to Kaletra (in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors) has been also observed in a small Phase II study (M97-720) through 360 \nweeks of treatment.  One hundred patients were originally treated with Kaletra in the study (including \n51 patients receiving 400/100 mg twice daily and 49 patients at either 200/100 mg twice daily or \n400/200 mg twice daily).  All patients converted to open-label Kaletra at the 400/100 mg twice daily \ndose between week 48 and week 72.  Thirty-nine patients (39%) discontinued the study, including 16 \n(16%) discontinuations due to adverse events, one of which was associated with a death.  Sixty-one \npatients completed the study (35 patients received the recommended 400/100 mg twice daily dose \nthroughout the study).     \n \nTable 2 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 360: Study M97-720 \n\n Kaletra (N=100) \nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml 61% \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml 59% \nMean increase from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) 501 \n\n \nThrough 360 weeks of treatment, genotypic analysis of viral isolates was successfully conducted in 19 \nof 28 patients with confirmed HIV RNA above 400 copies/ml revealed no primary or active site \nmutations in protease (amino acids at positions 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 82, 84 and 90) or protease \ninhibitor phenotypic resistance. \n \nPatients with prior antiretroviral therapy \n \nM97-765 is a randomised, double-blind trial evaluating Kaletra at two dose levels (400/100 mg and \n400/200 mg, both twice daily) plus nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and two nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors in 70 single protease inhibitor experienced, non-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor naïve patients.

Lopinavir is essentially completely metabolised by CYP3A.  Ritonavir \ninhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, thereby increasing the plasma levels of lopinavir.  Across studies, \nadministration of Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily yields mean steady-state lopinavir plasma \nconcentrations 15 to 20-fold higher than those of ritonavir in HIV-infected patients.  The plasma levels \nof ritonavir are less than 7% of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily.  The \nin vitro antiviral EC50 of lopinavir is approximately 10-fold lower than that of ritonavir.  Therefore, the \nantiviral activity of Kaletra is due to lopinavir. \n \nAbsorption \nMultiple dosing with 400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily for 2 weeks and without meal restriction \nproduced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 12.3 ± 5.4 µg/ml, occurring \napproximately 4 hours after administration.  The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the \nmorning dose was 8.1 ± 5.7 µg/ml.  Lopinavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n113.2 ± 60.5 µg•h/ml.  The absolute bioavailability of lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir in \nhumans has not been established. \n \nEffects of food on oral absorption  \nKaletra soft capsules and liquid have been shown to be bioequivalent under nonfasting conditions \n(moderate fat meal).  Administration of a single 400/100 mg dose of Kaletra soft capsules with a \nmoderate fat meal (500 – 682 kcal, 22.7 –25.1% from fat) was associated with a mean increase of 48% \nand 23% in lopinavir AUC and Cmax, respectively, relative to fasting.  For Kaletra oral solution, the \ncorresponding increases in lopinavir AUC and Cmax were 80% and 54%, respectively.  Administration \nof Kaletra with a high fat meal (872 kcal, 55.8% from fat) increased lopinavir AUC and Cmax by 96% \nand 43%, respectively, for soft capsules, and 130% and 56%, respectively, for oral solution.  To \nenhance bioavailability and minimise variability Kaletra is to be taken with food.  \n \nDistribution  \nAt steady state, lopinavir is approximately 98  −  99% bound to serum proteins.  Lopinavir binds to \nboth alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin however, it has a higher affinity for AAG.  At \nsteady state, lopinavir protein binding remains constant over the range of observed concentrations after \n400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily, and is similar between healthy volunteers and HIV-positive patients. \n \nBiotransformation  \nIn vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicate that lopinavir primarily undergoes \noxidative metabolism.  Lopinavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A.  Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor which inhibits the \nmetabolism of lopinavir and therefore, increases plasma levels of lopinavir.  A 14C-lopinavir study in \nhumans showed that 89% of the plasma radioactivity after a single 400/100 mg Kaletra dose was due \nto parent active substance.  At least 13 lopinavir oxidative metabolites have been identified in man.  \nThe 4-oxo and 4-hydroxymetabolite epimeric pair are the major metabolites with antiviral activity, but \n\n\n\n 37 \n\ncomprise only minute amounts of total plasma radioactivity.  Ritonavir has been shown to induce \nmetabolic enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism, and likely the induction of \nlopinavir metabolism.  Pre-dose lopinavir concentrations decline with time during multiple dosing, \nstabilising after approximately 10 days to 2 weeks. \n \nElimination \nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-lopinavir/ritonavir dose, approximately 10.4 ± 2.3% and 82.6 ± 2.5% of an \nadministered dose of 14C-lopinavir can be accounted for in urine and faeces, respectively.  Unchanged \nlopinavir accounted for approximately 2.2% and 19.8% of the administered dose in urine and faeces, \nrespectively.  After multiple dosing, less than 3% of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  The effective (peak to trough) half-life of lopinavir over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n5 − 6 hours, and the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of lopinavir is 6 to 7 l/h. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatrics  \nData from clinical trials in children below 2 years of age include the pharmacokinetics of Kaletra \n300/75 mg/m2 twice daily studied in a total of 31 paediatric patients, ranging in age from 14 days to \n6 months.  The pharmacokinetics of Kaletra 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily with nevirapine and \n230/57.5 mg/ m2 twice daily alone have been studied in 53 paediatric patients ranging in age from \n6 months to 12 years.  The mean (SD) for the studies are reported in the table below.  The \n230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily regimen \nwith nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients \nreceiving the 400/100 mg twice daily regimen without nevirapine.   \n \n\nCmax (µg/ml) Cmin (µg/ml) AUC12 (µg•h/ml) \nAge ≥ 14 days to < 6 weeks cohort (N = 9): \n\n5.17 (1.84) 1.40 (0.48) 43.39 (14.80) \nAge ≥ 6 weeks to < 6 months cohort (N = 18): \n\n9.39 (4.91) 1.95 (1.80) 74.50 (37.87) \nAge ≥ 6 months to < 12 years cohort (N = 53): \n\n8.2 (2.9)a 3.4 (2.1)a 72.6 (31.1)a \n10.0 (3.3)b 3.6 (3.5)b 85.8 (36.9)b \n\nAdultc \n12.3 (5.4) 8.1 (5.7) 113.2 (60.5) \n\na.

Kaletra film-coated tablets 400/100 mg twice daily at steady state \n\n \nGender, Race and Age   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in older people.  No age or gender related \npharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients.  Pharmacokinetic differences due to \nrace have not been identified. \n \nRenal Insufficiency   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, since \nthe renal clearance of lopinavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in \npatients with renal insufficiency. \n \nHepatic Insufficiency   \nThe steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir in HIV-infected patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment were compared with those of HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic \nfunction in a multiple dose study with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily.  A limited increase \nin total lopinavir concentrations of approximately 30% has been observed which is not expected to be \nof clinical relevance (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs identified major target organs as the liver, kidney, \nthyroid, spleen and circulating red blood cells.  Hepatic changes indicated cellular swelling with focal \ndegeneration.  While exposure eliciting these changes were comparable to or below human clinical \nexposure, dosages in animals were over 6-fold the recommended clinical dose.  Mild renal tubular \ndegeneration was confined to mice exposed with at least twice the recommended human exposure; the \nkidney was unaffected in rats and dogs.  Reduced serum thyroxin led to an increased release of TSH \nwith resultant follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid glands of rats.  These changes were reversible \nwith withdrawal of the active substance and were absent in mice and dogs.  Coombs-negative \nanisocytosis and poikilocytosis were observed in rats, but not in mice or dogs.  Enlarged spleens with \nhistiocytosis were seen in rats but not other species.  Serum cholesterol was elevated in rodents but not \ndogs, while triglycerides were elevated only in mice. \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (HERG) were inhibited by 30% at \nthe highest concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir tested, corresponding to a lopinavir exposure 7-fold \ntotal and 15-fold free peak plasma levels achieved in humans at the maximum recommended \ntherapeutic dose.  In contrast, similar concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no \nrepolarisation delay in the canine cardiac Purkinje fibres.  Lower concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir \ndid not produce significant potassium (HERG) current blockade.  Tissue distribution studies \nconducted in the rat did not suggest significant cardiac retention of the active substance; 72-hour AUC \nin heart was approximately 50% of measured plasma AUC.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that \ncardiac lopinavir levels would not be significantly higher than plasma levels. \n \nIn dogs, prominent U waves on the electrocardiogram have been observed associated with prolonged \nPR interval and bradycardia.  These effects have been assumed to be caused by electrolyte \ndisturbance.   \n \nThe clinical relevance of these preclinical data is unknown, however, the potential cardiac effects of \nthis product in humans cannot be ruled out (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nIn rats, embryofoetotoxicity (pregnancy loss, decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal body weights, \nincreased frequency of skeletal variations) and postnatal developmental toxicity (decreased survival of \npups) was observed at maternally toxic dosages.  The systemic exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir at the \nmaternal and developmental toxic dosages was lower than the intended therapeutic exposure in \nhumans. \n \nLong-term carcinogenicity studies of lopinavir/ritonavir in mice revealed a nongenotoxic, mitogenic \ninduction of liver tumours, generally considered to have little relevance to human risk.  \nCarcinogenicity studies in rats revealed no tumourigenic findings.  Lopinavir/ritonavir was not found \nto be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial \nreverse mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal \naberration assays in human lymphocytes. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nYellow debossed with [Abbott logo] and “KA”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKaletra is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children above the age of \n2 years.  \n \nThe choice of Kaletra to treat protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKaletra should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nKaletra tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents  \nThe standard recommended dosage of Kaletra tablets is 400/100 mg (two 200/50 mg) tablets twice \ndaily taken with or without food.  In adult patients, in cases where once-daily dosing is considered \nnecessary for the management of the patient, Kaletra tablets may be administered as 800/200 mg (four \n200/50 mg tablets) once daily with or without food.  The use of a once-daily dosing should be limited \nto those adult patients having only very few protease inhibitor (PI) associated mutations (i.e. less than \n3 PI mutations in line with clinical trial results, see section 5.1 for the full description of the \npopulation) and should take into account the risk of a lesser sustainability of the virologic suppression \n(see section 5.1) and higher risk of diarrhoea (see section 4.8) compared to the recommended standard \ntwice-daily dosing.  An oral solution is available to patients who have difficulty swallowing.  Refer to \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics for Kaletra oral solution for dosing instructions. \n \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nPaediatric population (2 years of age and above)  \nThe adult dose of Kaletra tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) may be used in children 40 kg or greater or \nwith a Body Surface Area (BSA)* greater than 1.4 m2.  For children weighing less than 40 kg or with \na BSA between 0.5 and 1.4 m2 and able to swallow tablets, please refer to the Kaletra 100 mg/25 mg \ntablets Summary of Product Characteristics.  For children unable to swallow tablets, please refer to the \nKaletra oral solution Summary of Product Characteristics.  Based on the current data available, Kaletra \nshould not be administered once daily in paediatric patients (see section 5.1). \n \n* Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation: \n \n\nBSA (m2) = √ (Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 3600) \n \nChildren less than 2 years of age  \nThe safety and efficacy of Kaletra in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade.  \n \nConcomitant Therapy: Efavirenz or nevirapine \nThe following table contains dosing guidelines for Kaletra tablets based on BSA when used in \ncombination with efavirenz or nevirapine in children. \n \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines with  \nconcomitant efavirenz or nevirapine \n\nBody Surface Area (m2) Recommended lopinavir/ritonavir dosing \n(mg) twice daily.   \n\nThe adequate dosing may be achieved with \nthe two available strengths of Kaletra \ntablets: 100/25 mg and 200/50 mg.* \n\n≥ 0.5 to < 0.8 200/50 mg \n≥ 0.8 to < 1.2 300/75 mg \n≥ 1.2 to < 1.4 400/100 mg \n\n≥ 1.4 500/125 mg \n* Kaletra tablets must not be chewed, broken or crushed. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nIn HIV-infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, an increase of approximately 30% \nin lopinavir exposure has been observed but is not expected to be of clinical relevance (see section \n5.2).  No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Kaletra must not be given to \nthese patients (see section 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.   \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \n• No dose adjustment is required for lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \n• Once-daily administration of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended for pregnant women due to \n\nthe lack of pharmacokinetic and clinical data. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nKaletra tablets are administered orally and must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or \ncrushed.  Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere hepatic insufficiency.  \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A \nfor clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life \nthreatening events.  These medicinal products include:  \n \n\nMedicinal product \nclass \n\nMedicinal products within \nclass \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased \n\nAlpha1-\nadrenoreceptor \nantagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of \nalfuzosin which may lead to severe \nhypotension.  The concomitant \nadministration with alfuzosin is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of \nranolazine which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, dronedarone Increased plasma concentrations of \namiodarone and dronedarone.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of arrhythmias or \nother serious adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic Acid Increased plasma concentrations of \nfusidic acid. The concomitant \nadministration with fusidic acid is \ncontraindicated in dermatological \ninfections (see section 4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of \nneratinib which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of \nvenetoclax.  Increased risk of tumor \nlysis syndrome at the dose initiation \nand during the ramp-up phase (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Increased plasma concentrations of \ncolchicine.  Potential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions in patients \nwith renal and/or hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, terfenadine Increased plasma concentrations of \nastemizole and terfenadine.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of serious \narrhythmias from these agents (see \nsection 4.5). \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nAntipsychotics/ \nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of \nlurasidone which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nPimozide Increased plasma concentrations of \npimozide.  Thereby, increasing the risk \nof serious haematologic abnormalities, \nor other serious adverse effects from \nthis agent (see section 4.5). \n\nQuetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of \nquetiapine which may lead to coma.  \nThe concomitant administration with \nquetiapine is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nErgot alkaloids Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, \nergotamine, methylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nergot derivatives leading to acute ergot \ntoxicity, including vasospasm and \nischaemia (see section 4.5). \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of \ncisapride.  Thereby, increasing the risk \nof serious arrhythmias from this agent \n(see section 4.5). \n\nHepatitis C virus \ndirect acting antivirals \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir Increased risk of alanine transaminase \n(ALT) elevations (see section 4.5). \n\nOmbitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwith or without dasabuvir \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nparitaprevir; thereby, increasing the \nrisk of alanine transaminase (ALT) \nelevations (see section 4.5). \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \n\n \n\nHMG Co-A \nReductase Inhibitors \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of \nlovastatin and simvastatin; thereby, \nincreasing the risk of myopathy \nincluding rhabdomyolysis (see section \n4.5). \n\nMicrosomal \ntriglyceride transfer \nprotein (MTTP) \ninhibitor \n\nLomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of \nlomitapide (see section 4.5). \n\nPhosphodiesterase \n(PDE5) inhibitors \n\nAvanafil Increased plasma concentrations of \navanafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nSildenafil \n \n\nContraindicated when used for the \ntreatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only.  Increased \nplasma concentrations of sildenafil.  \nThereby, increasing the potential for \nsildenafil-associated adverse events \n(which include hypotension and \nsyncope).  See section 4.4 and section \n4.5 for co-administration of sildenafil \nin patients with erectile dysfunction. \n\nVardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of \nvardenafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Oral midazolam, triazolam Increased plasma concentrations of oral \nmidazolam and triazolam.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of extreme sedation \nand respiratory depression from these \nagents.   \nFor caution on parenterally \nadministered midazolam, see section \n4.5. \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal products St. John’s wort Herbal preparations containing St \nJohn’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \ndue to the risk of decreased plasma \nconcentrations and reduced clinical \neffects of lopinavir and ritonavir (see \nsection 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment:  \nThe safety and efficacy of Kaletra has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver \ndisorders.  Kaletra is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.3).  \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant \nantiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these \nmedicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.  \n \nElevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 \nmono-infected and in individuals treated for post-exposure prophylaxis as early as 7 days after the \ninitiation of lopinavir/ritonavir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents.  In some cases the \nhepatic dysfunction was serious. \n \nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir \nand close monitoring should be performed during treatment. \n \nRenal impairment \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nHaemophilia \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal \nrelationship had been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated.  \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nPancreatitis \nCases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, including those who developed \nhypertriglyceridaemia.  In most of these cases patients have had a prior history of pancreatitis and/or \nconcurrent therapy with other medicinal products associated with pancreatitis.  Marked triglyceride \nelevation is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis.  Patients with advanced HIV disease may be \nat risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \npancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \nKaletra therapy should be suspended if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8).  \n \nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPR interval prolongation  \nLopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in \nsome healthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with \nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \nreceiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported \nin patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra is likely to increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily \nmetabolised by CYP3A.  These increases of plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal \nproducts could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see sections 4.3 and \n4.5). \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions.  Therefore, combination of \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nbedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, \nco-administration of bedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline SmPC). \n \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (as lopinavir/ritonavir) may \nincrease exposure to delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  \nTherefore, if co-administration of delamanid with lopinavir/ritonavir is considered necessary, very \nfrequent ECG monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section \n4.5 and refer to the delamanid SmPC). \n \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir.  Concomitant administration with colchicine is \ncontraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with:  \n- tadalafil, indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is not recommended \n\n(see section 4.5);  \n- riociguat is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- vorapaxar is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- fusidic acid in osteo-articular infections is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- salmeterol is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n-  rivaroxaban is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with atorvastatin is not recommended.  If the use of atorvastatin is \nconsidered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with \ncareful safety monitoring.  Caution must also be exercised and reduced doses should be considered if \nKaletra is used concurrently with rosuvastatin.  If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is \nindicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving Kaletra.  Co-administration of Kaletra with these medicinal products \nis expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant \nuse of avanafil or vardenafil and lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant \nuse of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nParticular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT \ninterval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin.  Indeed, \nKaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in \nan increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions.  Cardiac events have been reported with \nKaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently \nruled out (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nCo-administration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended.  Rifampicin in combination with \nKaletra causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn significantly decrease the \nlopinavir therapeutic effect.  Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved when a higher \ndose of Kaletra is used but this is associated with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.  \nTherefore, this co-administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4, \nsuch as budesonide and triamcinolone, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment \noutweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal \nsuppression (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nOther \nKaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.  While effective viral suppression with antiretroviral \ntherapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot \nbe excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national \nguidelines.   People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \ndisease and AIDS. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A \nin vitro.  Co-administration of Kaletra and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may \nresult in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or \nprolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions.  Kaletra does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nKaletra has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of \nsome medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP2C9 and \nCYP2C19) and by glucuronidation.  This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and potential \ndecrease of efficacy of co-administered medicinal products. \n  \nMedicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction \nand potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3. \n \nAll interaction studies, when otherwise not stated, were performed using Kaletra capsules, which gives \nan approximately 20% lower exposure of lopinavir than the 200/50 mg tablets. \n \nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below.  This list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  \nIndividual SmPCs should be consulted. \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between Kaletra and co-administered medicinal products are

\n \n \n\nCaution is warranted and therapeutic \ndrug monitoring of digoxin \nconcentrations, if available, is \nrecommended in case of \nco-administration of Kaletra and \ndigoxin.  Particular caution should be \nused when prescribing Kaletra in \npatients taking digoxin as the acute \ninhibitory effect of ritonavir on P-gp \nis expected to significantly increase \ndigoxin levels.  Initiation of digoxin \nin patients already taking Kaletra is \nlikely to result in lower than expected \nincreases of digoxin concentrations. \n\nBepridil, Systemic \nLidocaine, and \nQuinidine  \n\nBepridil, Systemic Lidocaine, \nQuinidine:  \nConcentrations may be increased \nwhen co-administered with \nlopinavir/ritonavir.  \n\nCaution is warranted and therapeutic \ndrug concentration monitoring is \nrecommended when available. \n\nAntibiotics \nClarithromycin Clarithromycin:  \n\nModerate increases in \nclarithromycin AUC are expected \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir.  \n \n\nFor patients with renal impairment \n(CrCL < 30 ml/min) dose reduction \nof clarithromycin should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4).  Caution \nshould be exercised in administering \nclarithromycin with Kaletra to \npatients with impaired hepatic or \nrenal function. \n\nAnticancer agents and kinase inhibitors \nAbemaciclib Serum concentrations may be \n\nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of abemaciclib \nand Kaletra should be avoided.  If \nthis co-administration is judged \nunavoidable, refer to the abemaciclib \nSmPC for dosage adjustment \nrecommendations.  Monitor for \nADRs related to abemaciclib. \n\nApalutamide Apalutamide is a moderate to \nstrong CYP3A4 inducer and this \nmay lead to a decreased exposure \nof lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nSerum concentrations of \napalutamide may be increased due \nto CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nDecreased exposure of Kaletra may \nresult in potential loss of virological \nresponse.   \nIn addition, co-administration of \napalutamide and Kaletra may lead to \nserious adverse events including \nseizure due to higher apalutamide \nlevels.

Co-administration of \nencorafenib and Kaletra should be \navoided.  If the benefit is considered \nto outweigh the risk and Kaletra must \nbe used, patients should be carefully \nmonitored for safety. \n\nFostamatinib Increase in fostamatinib \nmetabolite R406 exposure. \n\nCo-administration of fostamatinib \nwith Kaletra may increase \nfostamatinib metabolite R406 \nexposure resulting in dose-related \nadverse events such as \nhepatotoxicity, neutropenia, \nhypertension, or diarrhoea.  Refer to \nthe fostamatinib SmPC for dose \nreduction recommendations if such \nevents occur. \n\nIbrutinib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of ibrutinib and \nKaletra may increase ibrutinib \nexposure which may increase the risk \nof toxicity including risk of tumor \nlysis syndrome. Co-administration of \nibrutinib and Kaletra should be \navoided.  If the benefit is considered \nto outweigh the risk and Kaletra must \nbe used, reduce the ibrutinib dose to \n140 mg and monitor patient closely \nfor toxicity. \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nNeratinib Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant use of neratinib with \nKaletra is contraindicated due to \nserious and/or life-threatening \npotential reactions including \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.3). \n\nVenetoclax Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A inhibition \nby lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in \nincreased risk of tumor lysis \nsyndrome at the dose initiation and \nduring the ramp-up phase (see \nsection 4.3 and refer to the \nvenetoclax SmPC). \n \nFor patients who have completed the \nramp-up phase and are on a steady \ndaily dose of venetoclax, reduce the \nvenetoclax dose by at least 75% \nwhen used with strong CYP3A \ninhibitors (refer to the venetoclax \nSmPC for dosing instructions).  \nPatients should be closely monitored \nfor signs related to venetoclax \ntoxicities. \n\nAnticoagulants \nWarfarin \n \n \n \n\nWarfarin: \nConcentrations may be affected \nwhen co-administered with \nlopinavir/ritonavir due to \nCYP2C9 induction.   \n\nIt is recommended that INR \n(international normalised ratio) be \nmonitored. \n \n\nRivaroxaban \n \n(Ritonavir 600 mg twice \ndaily) \n\nRivaroxaban:   \nAUC: ↑ 153%  \nCmax: ↑ 55% \nDue to CYP3A and P-gp \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCo-administration of rivaroxaban and \nKaletra may increase rivaroxaban \nexposure which may increase the risk \nof bleeding. \nThe use of rivaroxaban is not \nrecommended in patients receiving \nconcomitant treatment with Kaletra \n(see section 4.4). \n\nVorapaxar Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe co-administration of vorapaxar \nwith Kaletra is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4 and refer to the vorapaxar \nSmPC). \n\nAnticonvulsants \nPhenytoin \n \n\nPhenytoin: \nSteady-state concentrations was \nmoderately decreased due to \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 induction \nby lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nLopinavir:   \nConcentrations are decreased due \nto CYP3A induction by \nphenytoin.   \n \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering phenytoin with Kaletra. \nPhenytoin levels should be monitored \nwhen co-administering with Kaletra. \nWhen co-administered with \nphenytoin, an increase of Kaletra \ndosage may be envisaged.  Dose \nadjustment has not been evaluated in \nclinical practice. \nKaletra must not be administered \nonce daily in combination with \nphenytoin. \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nCarbamazepine and \nPhenobarbital  \n\nCarbamazepine: \nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nLopinavir: \nConcentrations may be decreased \ndue to CYP3A induction by \ncarbamazepine and phenobarbital.   \n \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering carbamazepine or \nphenobarbital with Kaletra. \nCarbamazepine and phenobarbital \nlevels should be monitored when \nco-administering with Kaletra. \nWhen co-administered with \ncarbamazepine or phenobarbital, an \nincrease of Kaletra dosage may be \nenvisaged.  Dose adjustment has not \nbeen evaluated in clinical practice. \nKaletra must not be administered \nonce daily in combination with \ncarbamazepine and phenobarbital. \n\nLamotrigine and \nValproate \n\nLamotrigine:  \nAUC: ↓ 50% \nCmax: ↓ 46% \nCmin: ↓ 56% \n \nDue to induction of lamotrigine \nglucuronidation \n \nValproate: ↓ \n\nPatients should be monitored closely \nfor a decreased VPA effect when \nKaletra and valproic acid or valproate \nare given concomitantly. \n \nIn patients starting or stopping \nKaletra while currently taking \nmaintenance dose of lamotrigine:  \nlamotrigine dose may need to be \nincreased if Kaletra is added, or \ndecreased if Kaletra is discontinued; \ntherefore plasma lamotrigine \nmonitoring should be conducted, \nparticularly before and during 2 \nweeks after starting or stopping \nKaletra, in order to see if lamotrigine \ndose adjustment is needed. \nIn patients currently taking Kaletra \nand starting lamotrigine: no dose \nadjustments to the recommended \ndose escalation of lamotrigine should \nbe necessary.  \n\nAntidepressants and Anxiolytics \nTrazodone single dose \n \n(Ritonavir, 200 mg \nBID) \n \n\nTrazodone: \nAUC: ↑ 2.4-fold \n \nAdverse events of nausea, \ndizziness, hypotension and \nsyncope were observed following \nco-administration of trazodone \nand ritonavir.   \n\nIt is unknown whether the \ncombination of Kaletra causes a \nsimilar increase in trazodone \nexposure.

A reduction in colchicine \ndosage or an interruption of \ncolchicine treatment is recommended \nin patients with normal renal or \nhepatic function if treatment with \nKaletra is required.  Refer to \ncolchicine prescribing information. \n\nAntihistamines \nAstemizole \nTerfenadine \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and astemizole and \nterfenadine is contraindicated as it \nmay increase the risk of serious \narrhythmias from these agents (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nAnti-infectives \nFusidic acid Fusidic acid: \n\nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra with fusidic acid is contra-\nindicated in dermatological \nindications due to the increased risk \nof adverse events related to fusidic \nacid, notably rhabdomyolysis (see \nsection 4.3).  When used for osteo-\narticular infections, where the co-\nadministration is unavoidable, close \nclinical monitoring for muscular \nadverse events is strongly \nrecommended (see section 4.4).  \n\nAntimycobacterials \nBedaquiline \n(single dose) \n \n(Lopinavir/ritonavir \n400/100 mg BID, \nmultiple dose) \n\nBedaquiline: \nAUC: ↑ 22% \nCmax: ↔ \n \nA more pronounced effect on \nbedaquiline plasma exposures \nmay be observed during \nprolonged co-administration with \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibition likely due to \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nDue to the risk of bedaquiline related \nadverse events, the combination of \nbedaquiline and Kaletra should be \navoided.  If the benefit outweighs the \nrisk, co-administration of bedaquiline \nwith Kaletra must be done with \ncaution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and \nmonitoring of transaminases is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline SmPC). \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nDelamanid (100 mg \nBID) \n \n(Lopinavir/ritonavir \n400/100 mg BID) \n\nDelamanid: \nAUC: ↑ 22% \n \nDM-6705 (delamanid active \nmetabolite): \nAUC: ↑ 30% \n \nA more pronounced effect on \nDM-6705 exposure may be \nobserved during prolonged co-\nadministration with \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nDue to the risk of QTc prolongation \nassociated with DM-6705, if \nco-administration of delamanid with \nKaletra is considered necessary, very \nfrequent ECG monitoring throughout \nthe full delamanid treatment period is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the delamanid SmPC). \n\nRifabutin, 150 mg QD \n \n\nRifabutin (parent drug and active \n25-O-desacetyl metabolite):  \nAUC: ↑ 5.7-fold \nCmax: ↑ 3.5-fold  \n \n \n\nWhen given with Kaletra the \nrecommended dose of rifabutin is \n150 mg 3 times per week on set days \n(for example Monday-Wednesday-\nFriday).  Increased monitoring for \nrifabutin-associated adverse reactions \nincluding neutropenia and uveitis is \nwarranted due to an expected increase \nin exposure to rifabutin.  Further \ndosage reduction of rifabutin to \n150 mg twice weekly on set days is \nrecommended for patients in whom \nthe 150 mg dose 3 times per week is \nnot tolerated.  It should be kept in \nmind that the twice weekly dosage of \n150 mg may not provide an optimal \nexposure to rifabutin thus leading to a \nrisk of rifamycin resistance and a \ntreatment failure.  No dose \nadjustment is needed for Kaletra.  \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nRifampicin Lopinavir: \nLarge decreases in lopinavir \nconcentrations may be observed \ndue to CYP3A induction by \nrifampicin. \n \n \n\nCo-administration of Kaletra with \nrifampicin is not recommended as   \nthe decrease in lopinavir \nconcentrations may in turn \nsignificantly decrease the lopinavir \ntherapeutic effect.  A dose adjustment \nof Kaletra 400 mg/400 mg (i.e. \nKaletra 400/100 mg + ritonavir \n300 mg) twice daily has allowed \ncompensating for the CYP 3A4 \ninducer effect of rifampicin.  \nHowever, such a dose adjustment \nmight be associated with ALT/AST \nelevations and with increase in \ngastrointestinal disorders.  Therefore, \nthis co-administration should be \navoided unless judged strictly \nnecessary.  If this co-administration is \njudged unavoidable, increased dose \nof Kaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice \ndaily may be administered with \nrifampicin under close safety and \ntherapeutic drug monitoring.  The \nKaletra dose should be titrated \nupward only after rifampicin has been \ninitiated (see section 4.4). \n\nAntipsychotics \nLurasidone Due to CYP3A inhibition by \n\nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof lurasidone are expected to \nincrease. \n\nThe concomitant administration with \nlurasidone is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nPimozide Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof pimozide are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and pimozide is \ncontraindicated as it may increase the \nrisk of serious haematologic \nabnormalities or other serious \nadverse effects from this agent (see \nsection 4.3) \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof quetiapine are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and quetiapine is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nquetiapine-related toxicity. \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nBenzodiazepines \nMidazolam \n \n\nOral Midazolam:  \nAUC: ↑ 13-fold  \nParenteral Midazolam: \nAUC: ↑ 4-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir \n \n\nKaletra must not be co-administered \nwith oral midazolam (see section \n4.3), whereas caution should be used \nwith co-administration of Kaletra and \nparenteral midazolam.  If Kaletra is \nco-administered with parenteral \nmidazolam, it should be done in an \nintensive care unit (ICU) or similar \nsetting which ensures close clinical \nmonitoring and appropriate medical \nmanagement in case of respiratory \ndepression and/or prolonged sedation.  \nDosage adjustment for midazolam \nshould be considered especially if \nmore than a single dose of midazolam \nis administered. \n\nBeta2-adrenoceptor agonist (long acting) \nSalmeterol Salmeterol: \n\nConcentrations are expected to \nincrease due to CYP3A inhibition \nby lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe combination may result in \nincreased risk of cardiovascular \nadverse events associated with \nsalmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus \ntachycardia. \nTherefore, concomitant \nadministration of Kaletra with \nsalmeterol is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nCalcium channel blockers \nFelodipine, Nifedipine, \nand Nicardipine \n\nFelodipine, Nifedipine, \nNicardipine: \nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nClinical monitoring of therapeutic \nand adverse effects is recommended \nwhen these medicines are \nconcomitantly administered with \nKaletra. \n\nCorticosteroids \nDexamethasone Lopinavir: \n\nConcentrations may be decreased \ndue to CYP3A induction by \ndexamethasone. \n\nClinical monitoring of antiviral \nefficacy is recommended when these \nmedicines are concomitantly \nadministered with Kaletra. \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nInhaled, injectable or \nintranasal fluticasone \npropionate, budesonide, \ntriamcinolone \n\nFluticasone propionate, 50 µg \nintranasal 4 times daily: \nPlasma concentrations ↑ \nCortisol levels ↓ 86%  \n \n\nGreater effects may be expected \nwhen fluticasone propionate is \ninhaled.  Systemic corticosteroid \neffects including Cushing's syndrome \nand adrenal suppression have been \nreported in patients receiving \nritonavir and inhaled or intranasally \nadministered fluticasone propionate; \nthis could also occur with other \ncorticosteroids metabolised via the \nP450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide \nand triamcinolone.  Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of Kaletra \nand these glucocorticoids is not \nrecommended unless the potential \nbenefit of treatment outweighs the \nrisk of systemic corticosteroid effects \n(see section 4.4).  A dose reduction of \nthe glucocorticoid should be \nconsidered with close monitoring of \nlocal and systemic effects or a switch \nto a glucocorticoid, which is not a \nsubstrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone).  Moreover, in case \nof withdrawal of glucocorticoids \nprogressive dose reduction may have \nto be performed over a longer period.   \n\nPhosphodiesterase(PDE5) inhibitors \nAvanafil  \n(ritonavir 600 mg BID)  \n\nAvanafil: \nAUC: ↑ 13-fold  \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe use of avanafil with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).   \n \n\nTadalafil  \n \n \n\nTadalafil: \nAUC: ↑ 2-fold \nDue to CYP3A4 inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nFor the treatment of pulmonary \narterial hypertension: \nCo-administration of Kaletra with \nsildenafil is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).  Co-administration of \nKaletra with tadalafil is not \nrecommended. \n \nFor erectile dysfunction: \nParticular caution must be used when \nprescribing sildenafil or tadalafil in \npatients receiving Kaletra with \nincreased monitoring for adverse \nevents including hypotension, \nsyncope, visual changes and \nprolonged erection (see section 4.4).   \nWhen co-administered with Kaletra, \nsildenafil doses must not exceed \n25 mg in 48 hours and tadalafil doses \nmust not exceed 10 mg every 72 \nhours.   \n\nSildenafil \n \n \n\nSildenafil:  \nAUC: ↑ 11-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n \n\nVardenafil  \n \n \n\nVardenafil: \nAUC: ↑ 49-fold  \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe use of vardenafil with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).   \n \n\n\n\n 60 \n\nErgot alkaloids \nDihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, ergotamine, \nmethylergonovine \n\nSerum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and ergot alkaloids are \ncontraindicated as it may lead to \nacute ergot toxicity, including \nvasospasm and ischaemia (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nGI motility agent \nCisapride Serum concentrations may be \n\nincreased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and cisapride is \ncontraindicated as it may increase the \nrisk of serious arrhythmias from this \nagent (see section 4.3). \n\nHCV direct acting antivirals \nElbasvir/grazoprevir \n(50/200 mg QD) \n\n \nElbasvir: \nAUC: ↑ 2.71-fold \nCmax: ↑ 1.87-fold \nC24: ↑ 3.58-fold \n \nGrazoprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 11.86-fold \nCmax: ↑ 6.31-fold \nC24: ↑ 20.70-fold \n \n(combinations of mechanisms \nincluding CYP3A inhibition) \n \nLopinavir: ↔ \n\nConcomitant administration of \nelbasvir/grazoprevir with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to P-glycoprotein, \nBCRP and OATP1B inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir and Kaletra \nis not recommended due to an \nincreased risk of ALT elevations \nassociated with increased glecaprevir \nexposure. \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nOmbitasvir/paritaprevir/\nritonavir + dasabuvir \n \n(25/150/100 mg QD + \n400 mg BID) \n \nLopinavir/ritonavir  \n400/100 mg BID \n\nOmbitasvir: ↔  \n \nParitaprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 2.17-fold \nCmax: ↑ 2.04-fold \nCtrough: ↑ 2.36-fold \n \n(inhibition of CYP3A/efflux \ntransporters) \n \nDasabuvir: ↔ \n \nLopinavir: ↔ \n\nCo-administration is contraindicated. \n \nLopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg QD \nwas administered with \nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with \nor without dasabuvir.

However, only \nthe increase in voxilaprevir \nexposure is considered clinically \nrelevant. \n\nIt is not recommended to \nco-administer Kaletra and \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir. \n\nHCV protease inhibitors \nSimeprevir 200 mg \ndaily (ritonavir 100 mg \nBID) \n \n\nSimeprevir: \nAUC: ↑ 7.2-fold \nCmax: ↑ 4.7-fold \nCmin: ↑ 14.4-fold \n\nIt is not recommended to \nco-administer Kaletra and simeprevir. \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nHerbal products \nSt John’s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) \n\nLopinavir: \nConcentrations may be reduced \ndue to induction of CYP3A by the \nherbal preparation St John’s wort.   \n \n\nHerbal preparations containing St \nJohn’s wort must not be combined \nwith lopinavir and ritonavir.  If a \npatient is already taking St John’s \nwort, stop St John’s wort and if \npossible check viral levels.  Lopinavir \nand ritonavir levels may increase on \nstopping St John’s wort.  The dose of \nKaletra may need adjusting.  The \ninducing effect may persist for at \nleast 2 weeks after cessation of \ntreatment with St John’s wort (see \nsection 4.3).  Therefore, Kaletra can \nbe started safely 2 weeks after \ncessation of St John's wort.   \n\nImmunosuppressants \nCyclosporin, Sirolimus \n(rapamycin), and \nTacrolimus \n\nCyclosporin, Sirolimus \n(rapamycin), Tacrolimus:  \nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nMore frequent therapeutic \nconcentration monitoring is \nrecommended until plasma levels of \nthese products have been stabilised. \n\nLipid lowering agents \nLovastatin and \nSimvastatin \n\nLovastatin, Simvastatin: \nMarkedly increased plasma \nconcentrations due to CYP3A \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nSince increased concentrations of \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may \ncause myopathy, including \nrhabdomyolysis, the combination of \nthese agents with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nLipid-modifying agents \nLomitapide CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the \n\nexposure of lomitapide, with \nstrong inhibitors increasing \nexposure approximately 27-fold.  \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof lomitapide are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant use of Kaletra with \nlomitapide is contraindicated (see \nprescribing information for \nlomitapide) (see section 4.3). \n\nAtorvastatin Atorvastatin: \nAUC: ↑ 5.9-fold  \nCmax: ↑ 4.7-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe combination of Kaletra with \natorvastatin is not recommended.  If \nthe use of atorvastatin is considered \nstrictly necessary, the lowest possible \ndose of atorvastatin should be \nadministered with careful safety \nmonitoring (see section 4.4).   \n\nRosuvastatin, 20 mg QD \n \n\nRosuvastatin: \nAUC: ↑ 2-fold  \nCmax:  ↑ 5-fold \nWhile rosuvastatin is poorly \nmetabolised by CYP3A4, an \nincrease of its plasma \nconcentrations was observed.  The \nmechanism of this interaction may \nresult from inhibition of transport \nproteins. \n\nCaution should be exercised and \nreduced doses should be considered \nwhen Kaletra is co-administered with \nrosuvastatin (see section 4.4). \n\nFluvastatin or \nPravastatin \n\nFluvastatin, Pravastatin:  If treatment with an HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitor is indicated, \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nNo clinical relevant interaction \nexpected. \nPravastatin is not metabolised by \nCYP450. \nFluvastatin is partially \nmetabolised by CYP2C9. \n\nfluvastatin or pravastatin is \nrecommended. \n\nOpioids \nBuprenorphine, 16 mg \nQD \n\nBuprenorphine: ↔ \n \n\nNo dose adjustment necessary. \n \n\nMethadone \n \n\nMethadone: ↓ \n \n\nMonitoring plasma concentrations of \nmethadone is recommended. \n\nOral contraceptives \nEthinyl Oestradiol Ethinyl Oestradiol: ↓ \n\n \nIn case of co-administration of \nKaletra with contraceptives \ncontaining ethinyl oestradiol \n(whatever the contraceptive \nformulation e.g. oral or patch), \nadditional methods of contraception \nmust be used. \n\nSmoking cessation aids \nBupropion Buproprion and its active \n\nmetabolite, hydroxybupropion: \nAUC and Cmax ↓ ~50%  \n \nThis effect may be due to \ninduction of bupropion \nmetabolism. \n \n\nIf the co-administration of Kaletra \nwith bupropion is judged \nunavoidable, this should be done \nunder close clinical monitoring for \nbupropion efficacy, without \nexceeding the recommended dosage, \ndespite the observed induction. \n\nThyroid hormone replacement therapy \nLevothyroxine Post-marketing cases have been \n\nreported indicating a potential \ninteraction between ritonavir \ncontaining products and \nlevothyroxine. \n\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \nshould be monitored in patients \ntreated with levothyroxine at least the \nfirst month after starting and/or \nending lopinavir/ritonavir treatment. \n\nVasodilating agents \nBosentan Lopinavir - ritonavir: \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir plasma \nconcentrations may decrease due \nto CYP3A4 induction by \nbosentan. \n \nBosentan: \nAUC: ↑ 5-fold  \nCmax:  ↑ 6-fold \nInitially, bosentan Cmin: ↑ by \napproximately 48-fold.  \nDue to CYP3A4 inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nCaution should be exercised in \nadministering Kaletra with bosentan. \nWhen Kaletra is administered \nconcomitantly with bosentan, the \nefficacy of the HIV therapy should \nbe monitored and patients should be \nclosely observed for bosentan \ntoxicity, especially during the first \nweek of co-administration.   \n\nRiociguat Serum concentrations may be \nincreased due to CYP3A and P-gp \ninhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe co-administration of riociguat \nwith Kaletra is not recommended \n(see section 4.4 and refer to riociguat \nSmPC). \n\nOther medicinal products \nBased on known metabolic profiles, clinically significant interactions are not expected between \nKaletra and dapsone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin or fluconazole. \n\n \n\n\n\n 64 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in \norder to characterise the safety for the foetus. \n \nLopinavir/ritonavir has been evaluated in over 3000 women during pregnancy, including over 1000 \nduring the first trimester. \n \nIn post-marketing surveillance through the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, established since \nJanuary 1989, an increased risk of birth defects exposures with Kaletra has not been reported among \nover 1000 women exposed during the first trimester.  The prevalence of birth defects after any \ntrimester exposure to lopinavir is comparable to the prevalence observed in the general population.  \nNo pattern of birth defects suggestive of a common etiology was seen.  Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Based on the data mentioned, the malformative risk is unlikely \nin humans.  Lopinavir can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nBreastfeeding \nStudies in rats revealed that lopinavir is excreted in the milk.  It is not known whether this medicinal \nproduct is excreted in human milk.  As a general rule, it is recommended that mothers infected by HIV \ndo not breastfeed their babies under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.  \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown no effects on fertility.  No human data on the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir \non fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Patients \nshould be informed that nausea has been reported during treatment with Kaletra (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Kaletra has been investigated in over 2600 patients in Phase II-IV clinical trials, of \nwhich over 700 have received a dose of 800/200 mg (6 capsules or 4 tablets) once daily.  Along with \nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, Kaletra was used in combination \nwith efavirenz or nevirapine. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions related to Kaletra therapy during clinical trials were diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia.  The risk of diarrhoea may be \ngreater with once-daily dosing of Kaletra.  Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning \nof the treatment while hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later.  Treatment \nemergent adverse events led to premature study discontinuation for 7% of subjects from Phase II-IV \nstudies. \n \nIt is important to note that cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, \nincluding those who developed hypertriglyceridaemia.  Furthermore, rare increases in PR interval have \nbeen reported during Kaletra therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult and paediatric patients: \n \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nThe following events have been identified as adverse reactions.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nCushing’s syndrome has been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally \nadministered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via \nthe P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide (see section 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nIncreased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been \nreported with protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n 67 \n\n \nd. Paediatric populations \n \nIn children 2 years of age and older, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults (see \nTable in section b).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nTo date, there is limited human experience of acute overdose with Kaletra. \n \nThe adverse clinical signs observed in dogs included salivation, emesis and diarrhoea/abnormal stool.  \nThe signs of toxicity observed in mice, rats or dogs included decreased activity, ataxia, emaciation, \ndehydration and tremors.  \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Kaletra.  Treatment of overdose with Kaletra is to \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance is to be achieved \nby emesis or gastric lavage.  Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal \nof unabsorbed active substance.  Since Kaletra is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR10  \n \nMechanism of action \nLopinavir provides the antiviral activity of Kaletra.  Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 \nproteases.  Inhibition of HIV protease prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein resulting in the \nproduction of immature, non-infectious virus.  \n \nEffects on the electrocardiogram \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 39 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF from placebo were 3.6 (6.3) and \n13.1(15.8) for 400/100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800/200 mg twice daily LPV/r, \nrespectively.  The induced QRS interval prolongation from 6 ms to 9.5 ms with high dose \nlopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg twice daily) contributes to QT prolongation.  The two regimens \nresulted in exposures on Day 3 which were approximately 1.5 and 3-fold higher than those observed \nwith recommended once-daily or twice-daily LPV/r doses at steady state.  No subject experienced an \nincrease in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically \nrelevant threshold of 500 ms. \n \nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in the \nsame study on Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.6 ms to 24.4 ms \nin the 12 hour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 286 ms and no second or third degree \nheart block was observed (see section 4.4). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 68 \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against laboratory and clinical HIV strains was evaluated in \nacutely infected lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, respectively.  In the \nabsence of human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against five different HIV-1 laboratory strains \nwas 19 nM.  In the absence and presence of 50% human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against \nHIV-1IIIB in MT4 cells was 17 nM and 102 nM, respectively.  In the absence of human serum, the \nmean IC50 of lopinavir was 6.5 nM against several HIV-1 clinical isolates. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro selection of resistance \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in vitro.  HIV-1 has been \npassaged in vitro with lopinavir alone and with lopinavir plus ritonavir at concentration ratios \nrepresenting the range of plasma concentration ratios observed during Kaletra therapy.  Genotypic and \nphenotypic analysis of viruses selected in these passages suggest that the presence of ritonavir, at these \nconcentration ratios, does not measurably influence the selection of lopinavir-resistant viruses.  \nOverall, the in vitro characterisation of phenotypic cross-resistance between lopinavir and other \nprotease inhibitors suggest that decreased susceptibility to lopinavir correlated closely with decreased \nsusceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did not correlate closely with decreased susceptibility to \namprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in ARV-naïve patients   \nIn clinical studies with a limited number of isolates analysed, the selection of resistance to lopinavir \nhas not been observed in naïve patients without significant protease inhibitor resistance at baseline.  \nSee further the detailed description of the clinical studies. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in PI-experienced patients \nThe selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was \ncharacterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in \n2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral \nrebound subsequent to initial response to Kaletra and who demonstrated incremental in vitro resistance \nbetween baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in phenotypic \nsusceptibility to lopinavir).  Incremental resistance was most common in subjects whose baseline \nisolates had several protease inhibitor-associated mutations, but < 40-fold reduced susceptibility to \nlopinavir at baseline.  Mutations V82A, I54V and M46I emerged most frequently.  Mutations L33F, \nI50V and V32I combined with I47V/A were also observed.  The 19 isolates demonstrated a 4.3-fold \nincrease in IC50 compared to baseline isolates (from 6.2- to 43-fold, compared to wild-type virus). \n \nGenotypic correlates of reduced phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir in viruses selected by other \nprotease inhibitors.  The in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against 112 clinical isolates taken from \npatients failing therapy with one or more protease inhibitors was assessed.  Within this panel, the \nfollowing mutations in HIV protease were associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir: \nL10F/I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, M46I/L, F53L, I54L/T/V, L63P, A71I/L/T/V, V82A/F/T, I84V and \nL90M.  The median EC50 of lopinavir against isolates with 0 − 3, 4 − 5, 6 − 7 and 8 − 10 mutations at \nthe above amino acid positions was 0.8, 2.7 13.5 and 44.0-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type \nHIV, respectively.  The 16 viruses that displayed > 20-fold change in susceptibility all contained \nmutations at positions 10, 54, 63 plus 82 and/or 84.  In addition, they contained a median of 3 \nmutations at amino acid positions 20, 24, 46, 53, 71 and 90.  In addition to the mutations described \nabove, mutations V32I and I47A have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir \nsusceptibility from protease inhibitor experienced patients receiving Kaletra therapy, and mutations \nI47A and L76V have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir susceptibility from \npatients receiving Kaletra therapy. \n \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\nAntiviral activity of Kaletra in patients failing protease inhibitor therapy \nThe clinical relevance of reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir has been examined by assessing \nthe virologic response to Kaletra therapy, with respect to baseline viral genotype and phenotype, in 56 \npatients previous failing therapy with multiple protease inhibitors.  The EC50 of lopinavir against the \n56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0.6 to 96-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type HIV.  After \n48 weeks of treatment with Kaletra, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma \nHIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml was observed in 93% (25/27), 73% (11/15), and 25% (2/8) of patients with \n< 10-fold, 10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively.  In \naddition, virologic response was observed in 91% (21/23), 71% (15/21) and 33% (2/6) patients with \n0 − 5, 6 − 7, and 8 − 10 mutations of the above mutations in HIV protease associated with reduced \nin vitro susceptibility to lopinavir.  Since these patients had not previously been exposed to either \nKaletra or efavirenz, part of the response may be attributed to the antiviral activity of efavirenz, \nparticularly in patients harbouring highly lopinavir resistant virus.  The study did not contain a control \narm of patients not receiving Kaletra. \n \nCross-resistance \nActivity of other protease inhibitors against isolates that developed incremental resistance to lopinavir \nafter Kaletra therapy in protease inhibitor experienced patients: The presence of cross resistance to \nother protease inhibitors was analysed in 18 rebound isolates that had demonstrated evolution of \nresistance to lopinavir during 3 Phase II and one Phase III studies of Kaletra in protease inhibitor-\nexperienced patients.  The median fold IC50 of lopinavir for these 18 isolates at baseline and rebound \nwas 6.9- and 63-fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  In general, rebound isolates either \nretained (if cross-resistant at baseline) or developed significant cross-resistance to indinavir, \nsaquinavir and atazanavir.  Modest decreases in amprenavir activity were noted with a median \nincrease of IC50 from 3.7- to 8-fold in the baseline and rebound isolates, respectively.  Isolates retained \nsusceptibility to tipranavir with a median increase of IC50 in baseline and rebound isolates of 1.9- and \n1.8–fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  Please refer to the Aptivus Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for additional information on the use of tipranavir, including genotypic predictors of \nresponse, in treatment of lopinavir-resistant HIV-1 infection. \n \nClinical results \nThe effects of Kaletra (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers (plasma \nHIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts) have been investigated in controlled studies of Kaletra of \n48 to 360 weeks duration.   \n \nAdult Use \n \nPatients without prior antiretroviral therapy \n \nStudy M98-863 was a randomised, double-blind trial of 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients \ninvestigating Kaletra (400/100 mg twice daily) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) plus \nstavudine and lamivudine.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 259 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to \n949 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.9 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to \n6.8 log10 copies/ml).   \n \nTable 1 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 48: Study M98-863 \n\n Kaletra (N=326) Nelfinavir (N=327) \nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml* 75% 63% \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml*† 67% 52% \nMean increase from baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n207 195 \n\n* intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures  \n† p < 0.001 \n\n \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nOne-hundred thirteen nelfinavir-treated patients and 74 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients had an HIV \nRNA above 400 copies/ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96.  Of these, isolates \nfrom 96 nelfinavir-treated patients and 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients could be amplified for \nresistance testing.  Resistance to nelfinavir, defined as the presence of the D30N or L90M mutation in \nprotease, was observed in 41/96 (43%) patients.  Resistance to lopinavir, defined as the presence of \nany primary or active site mutations in protease (see above), was observed in 0/51 (0%) patients.  Lack \nof resistance to lopinavir was confirmed by phenotypic analysis. \n \nStudy M05-730 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial comparing treatment with Kaletra \n800/200 mg once daily plus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine versus Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily \nplus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine in 664 antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients.  Given the \npharmacokinetic interaction between Kaletra and tenofovir (see section 4.5), the results of this study \nmight not be strictly extrapolable when other backbone regimens are used with Kaletra.  Patients were \nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Kaletra 800/200 mg once daily (n = 333) or Kaletra \n400/100 mg twice daily (n = 331).  Further stratification within each group was 1:1 (tablet versus soft \ncapsule).  Patients were administered either the tablet or the soft capsule formulation for 8 weeks, after \nwhich all patients were administered the tablet formulation once daily or twice daily for the remainder \nof the study.  Patients were administered emtricitabine 200 mg once daily and tenofovir DF 300 mg \nonce daily (equivalent to 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil).  Protocol defined non-inferiority of once-daily \ndosing compared with twice-daily dosing was demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence \ninterval for the difference in proportion of subjects responding (once daily minus twice daily) \nexcluded -12% at Week 48.  Mean age of patients enrolled was 39 years (range: 19 to 71); 75% were \nCaucasian, and 78% were male.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 216 cells/mm3 (range: 20 to \n775 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log10 copies/ml (range: 1.7 to \n7.0 log10 copies/ml).   \n \nTable 2 \n \n\nVirologic Response of Study Subjects at Week 48 and Week 96 \n\n Week 48 Week 96 \n QD BID  Difference \n\n[95% CI] \nQD BID  Difference \n\n[95% CI] \nNC= Failure 257/333 \n\n(77.2%) \n251/331 \n(75.8%) \n\n1.3 % \n[-5.1, 7.8] \n\n216/333 \n(64.9%) \n\n229/331 \n(69.2%) \n\n-4.3% \n[-11.5, 2.8] \n\nObserved data 257/295 \n(87.1%) \n\n250/280 \n(89.3%) \n\n-2.2% \n[-7.4, 3.1] \n\n216/247 \n(87.4%) \n\n229/248 \n(92.3%) \n\n-4.9% \n[-10.2, 0.4] \n\nMean increase from \nbaseline in CD4+ T-cell \ncount (cells/mm3) \n\n186 198  238 254  \n\n \nThrough Week 96, genotypic resistance testing results were available from 25 patients in the QD \ngroup and 26 patients in the BID group who had incomplete virologic response.  In the QD group, no \npatient demonstrated lopinavir resistance, and in the BID group, 1 patient who had significant protease \ninhibitor resistance at baseline demonstrated additional lopinavir resistance on study. \n \nSustained virological response to Kaletra (in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors) has been also observed in a small Phase II study (M97-720) through 360 \nweeks of treatment.  One hundred patients were originally treated with Kaletra in the study (including \n51 patients receiving 400/100 mg twice daily and 49 patients at either 200/100 mg twice daily or \n400/200 mg twice daily).  All patients converted to open-label Kaletra at the 400/100 mg twice-daily \ndose between week 48 and week 72.  Thirty-nine patients (39%) discontinued the study, including 16 \n(16%) discontinuations due to adverse events, one of which was associated with a death.

Patients had not been on prior lopinavir/ritonavir \ntherapy.  They were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg once \ndaily (n = 300) or lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 299).  Patients were administered at \nleast two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors selected by the investigator.  The \nenrolled population was moderately PI-experienced with more than half of patients having never \nreceived prior PI and around 80% of patients presenting a viral strain with less than 3 PI mutations.  \nMean age of patients enrolled was 41 years (range: 21 to 73); 51% were Caucasian and 66% were \nmale.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 254 cells/mm3 (range: 4 to 952 cells/mm3) and mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10 copies/ml (range: 1.7 to 6.6 log10 copies/ml).  Around 85% \nof patients had a viral load of < 100,000 copies/ml. \n \nTable 4 \n \n\nVirologic Response of Study Subjects at Week 48 Study 802 \n\n QD BID Difference \n[95% CI] \n\nNC= Failure 171/300 \n(57%) \n\n161/299 \n(53.8%) \n\n3.2% \n[-4.8%, 11.1%] \n\nObserved data 171/225 \n(76.0%) \n\n161/223 \n(72.2%) \n\n3.8% \n[-4.3%, 11.9%] \n\nMean increase from baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n135 122  \n\n \nThrough Week 48, genotypic resistance testing results were available from 75 patients in the QD \ngroup and 75 patients in the BID group who had incomplete virologic response.  In the QD group, \n6/75 (8%) patients demonstrated new primary protease inhibitor mutations (codons 30, 32, 48, 50, 82, \n84, 90), as did 12/77 (16%) patients in the BID group. \n \nPaediatric Use \n \nM98-940 was an open-label study of a liquid formulation of Kaletra in 100 antiretroviral naïve (44%) \nand experienced (56%) paediatric patients.  All patients were non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor naïve.  Patients were randomised to either 230 mg lopinavir/57.5 mg ritonavir per m2 or \n300 mg lopinavir/75 mg ritonavir per m2.  Naïve patients also received nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors.  Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors.  Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after \n3 weeks of therapy in each patient.  Subsequently, all patients were continued on the 300/75 mg per m2 \n\n\n\n 72 \n\ndose.  Patients had a mean age of 5 years (range 6 months to 12 years) with 14 patients less than 2 \nyears old and 6 patients one year or less.

Children were eligible when \nthey were aged <18 years, ≥15 kg in weight, receiving cART that included lopinavir/ritonavir, HIV-1 \nribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/ml for at least 24 weeks and able to swallow tablets.  At week 48, \nthe efficacy and safety with twice-daily dosing (n=87) in the paediatric population given \nlopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg tablets was consistent with the efficacy and safety findings in \nprevious adult and paediatric studies using lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily.  The percentage of patients \nwith confirmed viral rebound >50 copies/ml during 48 weeks of follow-up was higher in the paediatric \npatients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets once daily (12%) than in patients receiving the twice-daily \ndosing (8%, p = 0.19), mainly due to lower adherence in the once-daily group.  The efficacy data \nfavouring the twice-daily regimen are reinforced by a differential in pharmacokinetic parameters \nsignificantly favouring the twice-daily regimen (see section 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lopinavir co-administered with ritonavir have been evaluated in \nhealthy adult volunteers and in HIV-infected patients; no substantial differences were observed \nbetween the two groups.  Lopinavir is essentially completely metabolised by CYP3A.  Ritonavir \ninhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, thereby increasing the plasma levels of lopinavir.  Across studies, \nadministration of Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily yields mean steady-state lopinavir plasma \nconcentrations 15 to 20-fold higher than those of ritonavir in HIV-infected patients.  The plasma levels \nof ritonavir are less than 7% of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily.  The \nin vitro antiviral EC50 of lopinavir is approximately 10-fold lower than that of ritonavir.  Therefore, the \nantiviral activity of Kaletra is due to lopinavir. \n \nAbsorption \nMultiple dosing with 400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily for 2 weeks and without meal restriction \nproduced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 12.3 ± 5.4 µg/ml, occurring \napproximately 4 hours after administration.  The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the \nmorning dose was 8.1 ± 5.7 µg/ml.  Lopinavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n113.2 ± 60.5 µg•h/ml.  The absolute bioavailability of lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir in \nhumans has not been established. \n \nEffects of food on oral absorption \nAdministration of a single 400/100 mg dose of Kaletra tablets under fed conditions (high fat, 872 kcal, \n56% from fat) compared to fasted state was associated with no significant changes in Cmax and AUCinf.  \nTherefore, Kaletra tablets may be taken with or without food.  Kaletra tablets have also shown less \npharmacokinetic variability under all meal conditions compared to Kaletra soft capsules. \n \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nDistribution \nAt steady state, lopinavir is approximately 98 − 99% bound to serum proteins.  Lopinavir binds to both \nalpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin however, it has a higher affinity for AAG.  At steady \nstate, lopinavir protein binding remains constant over the range of observed concentrations after \n400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily, and is similar between healthy volunteers and HIV-positive patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicate that lopinavir primarily undergoes \noxidative metabolism.  Lopinavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A.  Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor which inhibits the \nmetabolism of lopinavir and therefore, increases plasma levels of lopinavir.  A 14C-lopinavir study in \nhumans showed that 89% of the plasma radioactivity after a single 400/100 mg Kaletra dose was due \nto parent active substance.  At least 13 lopinavir oxidative metabolites have been identified in man.  \nThe 4-oxo and 4-hydroxymetabolite epimeric pair are the major metabolites with antiviral activity, but \ncomprise only minute amounts of total plasma radioactivity.  Ritonavir has been shown to induce \nmetabolic enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism, and likely the induction of \nlopinavir metabolism.  Pre-dose lopinavir concentrations decline with time during multiple dosing, \nstabilising after approximately 10 days to 2 weeks. \n \nElimination \nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-lopinavir/ritonavir dose, approximately 10.4 ± 2.3% and 82.6 ± 2.5% of an \nadministered dose of 14C-lopinavir can be accounted for in urine and faeces, respectively.  Unchanged \nlopinavir accounted for approximately 2.2% and 19.8% of the administered dose in urine and faeces, \nrespectively.  After multiple dosing, less than 3% of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  The effective (peak to trough) half-life of lopinavir over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n5 − 6 hours, and the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of lopinavir is 6 to 7 l/h. \n \nOnce-daily dosing: the pharmacokinetics of once daily Kaletra have been evaluated in HIV-infected \nsubjects naïve to antiretroviral treatment.  Kaletra 800/200 mg was administered in combination with \nemtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg as part of a once-daily regimen.  Multiple dosing of \n800/200 mg Kaletra once daily for 2 weeks without meal restriction (n=16) produced a mean ± SD \nlopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 14.8 ± 3.5 µg/ml, occurring approximately 6 hours after \nadministration.  The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the morning dose was \n5.5 ± 5.4 µg/ml.  Lopinavir AUC over a 24 hour dosing interval averaged 206.5 ± 89.7 µg•h/ml. \n \nAs compared to the BID regimen, the once-daily dosing is associated with a reduction in the \nCmin/Ctrough values of approximately 50%.   \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatrics \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in children below 2 years of age.  The pharmacokinetics of \nKaletra oral solution 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily and 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily have been studied in a \ntotal of 53 paediatric patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years.  The lopinavir mean steady-\nstate AUC, Cmax, and Cmin were 72.6 ± 31.1 µg•h/ml, 8.2 ± 2.9 µg/ml and 3.4 ± 2.1 µg/ml, respectively \nafter Kaletra oral solution 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily without nevirapine (n=12), and were \n85.8 ± 36.9 µg•h/ml, 10.0 ± 3.3 µg/ml and 3.6 ± 3.5 µg/ml, respectively after 300/75 mg/m2 twice \ndaily with nevirapine (n=12).  The 230/57.5 mg/m2 twice-daily regimen without nevirapine and the \n300/75 mg/m2 twice-daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar \nto those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400/100 mg twice-daily regimen without nevirapine.   \n \nGender, Race and Age   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in older people.  No age or gender related \npharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients.  Pharmacokinetic differences due to \nrace have not been identified. \n \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nPregnancy and postpartum \nIn an open-label pharmacokinetic study, 12 HIV-infected pregnant women who were less than 20 \nweeks of gestation and on combination antiretroviral therapy initially received lopinavir/ritonavir 400 \nmg/100 mg (two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily up to a gestational age of 30 weeks. At 30 weeks age \nof gestation, the dose was increased to 500/125 mg (two 200/50 mg tablets plus one 100/25 mg tablet) \ntwice daily until subjects were 2 weeks postpartum. Plasma concentrations of lopinavir were measured \nover four 12-hour periods during second trimester (20-24 weeks gestation), third trimester before dose \nincrease (30 weeks gestation), third trimester after dose increase (32 weeks gestation), and at 8 weeks \npost-partum. The dose increase did not result in a significant increase in the plasma lopinavir \nconcentration.  \n \nIn another open-label pharmacokinetic study, 19 HIV-infected pregnant women received \nlopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily as part of combination antiretroviral therapy during \npregnancy from before conception. A series of blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals \nover the course of 12 hours in trimester 2 and trimester 3, at birth, and 4–6 weeks postpartum (in \nwomen who continued treatment post-delivery) for pharmacokinetic analysis of total and unbound \nlevels of plasma lopinavir concentrations. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic data from HIV-1 infected pregnant women receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets \n400/100 mg twice daily are presented in Table 6 (see section 4.2). \n \nTable 6 \n \n\nMean (%CV) Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Lopinavir  \nin HIV-Infected Pregnant Women \n\nPharmacokinetic \nParameter \n\n2nd Trimester \nn = 17* \n\n3rd Trimester \nn = 23 \n\nPostpartum \nn = 17** \n\nAUC0-12 μg•hr/mL 68.7 (20.6) 61.3 (22.7) 94.3 (30.3) \nCmax 7.9 (21.1) 7.5 (18.7) 9.8 (24.3) \n\nCpredose μg /mL 4.7 (25.2) 4.3 (39.0) 6.5 (40.4) \n*   n = 18 for Cmax \n** n = 16 for Cpredose \n\n \nRenal Insufficiency   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, since \nthe renal clearance of lopinavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in \npatients with renal insufficiency. \n \nHepatic Insufficiency \nThe steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir in HIV-infected patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment were compared with those of HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic \nfunction in a multiple dose study with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily.  A limited increase \nin total lopinavir concentrations of approximately 30% has been observed which is not expected to be \nof clinical relevance (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs identified major target organs as the liver, kidney, \nthyroid, spleen and circulating red blood cells.  Hepatic changes indicated cellular swelling with focal \ndegeneration.  While exposure eliciting these changes were comparable to or below human clinical \nexposure, dosages in animals were over 6-fold the recommended clinical dose.  Mild renal tubular \ndegeneration was confined to mice exposed with at least twice the recommended human exposure; the \nkidney was unaffected in rats and dogs.  Reduced serum thyroxin led to an increased release of TSH \nwith resultant follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid glands of rats.  These changes were reversible \nwith withdrawal of the active substance and were absent in mice and dogs.  Coombs-negative \nanisocytosis and poikilocytosis were observed in rats, but not in mice or dogs.  Enlarged spleens with \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nhistiocytosis were seen in rats but not other species.  Serum cholesterol was elevated in rodents but not \ndogs, while triglycerides were elevated only in mice.  \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (HERG) were inhibited by 30% at \nthe highest concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir tested, corresponding to a lopinavir exposure 7-fold \ntotal and 15-fold free peak plasma levels achieved in humans at the maximum recommended \ntherapeutic dose.  In contrast, similar concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no \nrepolarisation delay in the canine cardiac Purkinje fibres.  Lower concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir \ndid not produce significant potassium (HERG) current blockade.  Tissue distribution studies \nconducted in the rat did not suggest significant cardiac retention of the active substance; 72-hour AUC \nin heart was approximately 50% of measured plasma AUC.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that \ncardiac lopinavir levels would not be significantly higher than plasma levels. \n \nIn dogs, prominent U waves on the electrocardiogram have been observed associated with prolonged \nPR interval and bradycardia.  These effects have been assumed to be caused by electrolyte \ndisturbance.   \n \nThe clinical relevance of these preclinical data is unknown, however, the potential cardiac effects of \nthis product in humans cannot be ruled out (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nIn rats, embryofoetotoxicity (pregnancy loss, decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal body weights, \nincreased frequency of skeletal variations) and postnatal developmental toxicity (decreased survival of \npups) was observed at maternally toxic dosages.  The systemic exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir at the \nmaternal and developmental toxic dosages was lower than the intended therapeutic exposure in \nhumans.   \n \nLong-term carcinogenicity studies of lopinavir/ritonavir in mice revealed a nongenotoxic, mitogenic \ninduction of liver tumours, generally considered to have little relevance to human risk.   \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in rats revealed no tumourigenic findings.  Lopinavir/ritonavir was not found \nto be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial \nreverse mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal \naberration assays in human lymphocytes. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of lopinavir co-formulated with 25 mg of ritonavir as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nPale yellow debossed with [Abbott logo] and “KC”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKaletra is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected children above the age of 2 years, adolescents and \nadults.  \n \nThe choice of Kaletra to treat protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKaletra should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nKaletra tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents  \nThe standard recommended dosage of Kaletra tablets is 400/100 mg (two 200/50 mg) tablets twice \ndaily taken with or without food.  In adult patients, in cases where once-daily dosing is considered \nnecessary for the management of the patient, Kaletra tablets may be administered as 800/200 mg (four \n200/50 mg tablets) once daily with or without food.  The use of a once-daily dosing should be limited \nto those adult patients having only very few protease inhibitor (PI) associated mutations (i.e. less than \n3 PI mutations in line with clinical trial results, see section 5.1 for the full description of the \npopulation) and should take into account the risk of a lesser sustainability of the virologic suppression \n(see section 5.1) and higher risk of diarrhoea (see section 4.8) compared to the recommended standard \ntwice-daily dosing.  An oral solution is available to patients who have difficulty swallowing.  Refer to \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics for Kaletra oral solution for dosing instructions. \n \nPaediatric population (2 years of age and above) \nThe adult dose of Kaletra tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) may be used in children 40 kg or greater or \nwith a Body Surface Area (BSA)* greater than 1.4 m2.  For children weighing less than 40 kg or with \na BSA between 0.5 and 1.4 m2 and able to swallow tablets, refer to the dosing guideline tables below.  \nFor children unable to swallow tablets, please refer to the Kaletra oral solution Summary of Product \nCharacteristics.  Based on the current data available, Kaletra should not be administered once daily in \npaediatric patients (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n 79 \n\n \nBefore prescribing Kaletra 100/25 mg tablets, infants and young children should be assessed for the \nability to swallow intact tablets.  If a child is unable to reliably swallow a Kaletra tablet, Kaletra oral \nsolution formulation should be prescribed. \n \nThe following table contains dosing guidelines for Kaletra 100/25 mg tablets based on body weight \nand BSA.   \n \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines \nwithout concomitant efavirenz or nevirapine*  \n\nWeight (kg) Body Surface Area (m2) Recommended number of  \n100/25 mg tablets twice-daily \n\n15 to 25 ≥ 0.5 to < 0.9 2 tablets (200/50 mg) \n> 25 to 35 ≥ 0.9 to < 1.4 3 tablets (300/75 mg) \n\n> 35 ≥ 1.4 4 tablets (400/100 mg) \n *weight based dosing recommendations are based on limited data  \n \nIf more convenient for patients, the Kaletra 200/50 mg tablets may also be considered alone or in \ncombination with the Kaletra 100/25 mg tablet to achieve the recommended dose. \n \n* Body surface area can be calculated with the following equation: \n \n\nBSA (m2) = √ (Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / 3600) \n \nChildren less than 2 years of age \nThe safety and efficacy of Kaletra in children aged less than 2 years have not been established.  \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on the posology can be \nmade. \n \nConcomitant Therapy: Efavirenz or nevirapine \nThe following table contains dosing guidelines for Kaletra 100/25 mg tablets based on BSA when \nused in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine in children. \n \n\nPaediatric dosing guidelines with concomitant  \nefavirenz or nevirapine  \n\nBody Surface Area (m2) Recommended number of  \n100/25 mg tablets twice-daily \n\n≥ 0.5 to < 0.8 2 tablets (200/50 mg) \n≥ 0.8 to < 1.2 3 tablets (300/75 mg) \n≥ 1.2 to < 1.4 4 tablets (400/100 mg) \n\n≥ 1.4 5 tablets (500/125 mg) \n \nIf more convenient for patients, the Kaletra 200/50 mg tablets may also be considered alone or in \ncombination with the Kaletra 100/25 mg tablet to achieve the recommended dose. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn HIV-infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, an increase of approximately 30% \nin lopinavir exposure has been observed but is not expected to be of clinical relevance (see section \n5.2).  No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Kaletra must not be given to \nthese patients (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nRenal impairment \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \n• No dose adjustment is required for lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \n• Once-daily administration of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended for pregnant women due to \n\nthe lack of pharmacokinetic and clinical data. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nKaletra tablets are administered orally and must be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or \ncrushed.  Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere hepatic insufficiency.  \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A \nfor clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life \nthreatening events.  These medicinal products include:  \n \n\nMedicinal product \nclass \n\nMedicinal products within \nclass \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased \n\nAlpha1-adrenoreceptor \nantagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of \nalfuzosin which may lead to severe \nhypotension.  The concomitant \nadministration with alfuzosin is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of \nranolazine which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, dronedarone Increased plasma concentrations of \namiodarone and dronedarone.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of arrhythmias or other \nserious adverse reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic Acid Increased plasma concentrations of fusidic \nacid. The concomitant administration with \nfusidic acid is contraindicated in \ndermatological infections (see section \n4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of \nneratinib which may increase the potential \nfor serious and/or life-threatening \nreactions (see section 4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of \nvenetoclax.  Increased risk of tumor lysis \nsyndrome at the dose initiation and during \nthe ramp-up phase (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 81 \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Increased plasma concentrations of \ncolchicine.  Potential for serious and/or \nlife-threatening reactions in patients with \nrenal and/or hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, terfenadine Increased plasma concentrations of \nastemizole and terfenadine.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of serious arrhythmias \nfrom these agents (see section 4.5). \n\nAntipsychotics/ \nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of \nlurasidone which may increase the \npotential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening reactions (see section 4.5). \n\nPimozide Increased plasma concentrations of \npimozide.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious haematologic abnormalities, or \nother serious adverse effects from this \nagent (see section 4.5). \n\nQuetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of \nquetiapine which may lead to coma.  The \nconcomitant administration with \nquetiapine is contraindicated (see section \n4.5). \n\nErgot alkaloids Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, \nergotamine, methylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of ergot \nderivatives leading to acute ergot toxicity, \nincluding vasospasm and ischaemia (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of \ncisapride.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious arrhythmias from this agent (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nHepatitis C virus direct \nacting antivirals \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir Increased risk of alanine transaminase \n(ALT) elevations (see section 4.5). \n\nOmbitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir \nwith or without dasabuvir \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nparitaprevir; thereby, increasing the risk of \nalanine transaminase (ALT) elevations \n(see section 4.5). \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \n\n \n\nHMG Co-A Reductase \nInhibitors \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of \nlovastatin and simvastatin; thereby, \nincreasing the risk of myopathy including \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.5). \n\nMicrosomal triglyceride \ntransfer protein (MTTP) \ninhibitor \n\nLomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of \nlomitapide (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 82 \n\nPhosphodiesterase \n(PDE5) inhibitors \n\nAvanafil Increased plasma concentrations of \navanafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nSildenafil \n \n\nContraindicated when used for the \ntreatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only.  Increased \nplasma concentrations of sildenafil.  \nThereby, increasing the potential for \nsildenafil-associated adverse events \n(which include hypotension and syncope).  \nSee section 4.4 and section 4.5 for \nco-administration of sildenafil in patients \nwith erectile dysfunction. \n\nVardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of \nvardenafil (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Oral midazolam, triazolam Increased plasma concentrations of oral \nmidazolam and triazolam.  Thereby, \nincreasing the risk of extreme sedation \nand respiratory depression from these \nagents.   \nFor caution on parenterally administered \nmidazolam, see section 4.5. \n\nLopinavir/ritonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal products St. John’s wort Herbal preparations containing St John’s \nwort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the \nrisk of decreased plasma concentrations \nand reduced clinical effects of lopinavir \nand ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of Kaletra has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver \ndisorders.  Kaletra is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.3).  \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant \nantiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these \nmedicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, \ninterruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.  \n \nElevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 \nmono-infected and in individuals treated for post-exposure prophylaxis as early as 7 days after the \ninitiation of lopinavir/ritonavir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents.  In some cases the \nhepatic dysfunction was serious. \n \nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir \nand close monitoring should be performed during treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 83 \n\nRenal impairment \nSince the renal clearance of lopinavir and ritonavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are \nnot expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because lopinavir and ritonavir are highly protein \nbound, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nHaemophilia \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal \nrelationship had been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated.  \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nPancreatitis \nCases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, including those who developed \nhypertriglyceridaemia.  In most of these cases patients have had a prior history of pancreatitis and/or \nconcurrent therapy with other medicinal products associated with pancreatitis.  Marked triglyceride \nelevation is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis.  Patients with advanced HIV disease may be \nat risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \npancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \nKaletra therapy should be suspended if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8).  \n \nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPR interval prolongation  \nLopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in \nsome healthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with \nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \nreceiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported \nin patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A.  \nKaletra is likely to increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily \nmetabolised by CYP3A.  These increases of plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal \nproducts could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see sections 4.3 and \n4.5). \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions.  Therefore, combination of \nbedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, \nco-administration of bedaquiline with lopinavir/ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline SmPC). \n \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (as lopinavir/ritonavir) may \nincrease exposure to delamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  \nTherefore, if co-administration of delamanid with lopinavir/ritonavir is considered necessary, very \nfrequent ECG monitoring throughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section \n4.5 and refer to the delamanid SmPC). \n \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir.  Concomitant administration with colchicine is \ncontraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with:  \n- tadalafil, indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is not recommended \n\n(see section 4.5);  \n- riociguat is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- vorapaxar is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- fusidic acid in osteo-articular infections is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- salmeterol is not recommended (see section 4.5); \n- rivaroxaban is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combination of Kaletra with atorvastatin is not recommended.  If the use of atorvastatin is \nconsidered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with \ncareful safety monitoring.  Caution must also be exercised and reduced doses should be considered if \nKaletra is used concurrently with rosuvastatin.  If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is \nindicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving Kaletra.  Co-administration of Kaletra with these medicinal products \nis expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant \nuse of avanafil or vardenafil and lopinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant \nuse of sildenafil prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with Kaletra is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nParticular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT \ninterval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin.  Indeed, \nKaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in \nan increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions.  Cardiac events have been reported with \nKaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently \nruled out (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n\n\n\n 85 \n\n \nCo-administration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended.  Rifampicin in combination with \nKaletra causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn significantly decrease the \nlopinavir therapeutic effect.  Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved when a higher \ndose of Kaletra is used but this is associated with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.  \nTherefore, this co-administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4, \nsuch as budesonide and triamcinolone, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment \noutweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal \nsuppression (see section 4.5). \n \nOther \nKaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.  While effective viral suppression with antiretroviral \ntherapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot \nbe excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national \nguidelines.   People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \ndisease and AIDS. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nKaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A \nin vitro.  Co-administration of Kaletra and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may \nresult in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or \nprolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions.  Kaletra does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nKaletra has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of \nsome medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP2C9 and \nCYP2C19) and by glucuronidation.  This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and potential \ndecrease of efficacy of co-administered medicinal products. \n  \nMedicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction \nand potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3. \n \nAll interaction studies, when otherwise not stated, were performed using Kaletra capsules, which gives \nan approximately 20% lower exposure of lopinavir than the 200/50 mg tablets. \n \nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below.  This list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  \nIndividual SmPCs should be consulted. \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between Kaletra and co-administered medicinal products are

Increased \nmonitoring for rifabutin-associated \nadverse reactions including \nneutropenia and uveitis is warranted \ndue to an expected increase in \nexposure to rifabutin.  Further \ndosage reduction of rifabutin to \n150 mg twice weekly on set days is \nrecommended for patients in whom \nthe 150 mg dose 3 times per week is \nnot tolerated.  It should be kept in \nmind that the twice weekly dosage \nof 150 mg may not provide an \noptimal exposure to rifabutin thus \nleading to a risk of rifamycin \nresistance and a treatment failure.  \nNo dose adjustment is needed for \nKaletra.  \n\nRifampicin Lopinavir: \nLarge decreases in lopinavir \nconcentrations may be observed \ndue to CYP3A induction by \nrifampicin. \n \n \n\nCo-administration of Kaletra with \nrifampicin is not recommended as   \nthe decrease in lopinavir \nconcentrations may in turn \nsignificantly decrease the lopinavir \ntherapeutic effect.  A dose \nadjustment of Kaletra \n400 mg/400 mg (i.e. Kaletra \n400/100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg) \ntwice daily has allowed \ncompensating for the CYP 3A4 \ninducer effect of rifampicin.  \nHowever, such a dose adjustment \nmight be associated with ALT/AST \nelevations and with increase in \ngastrointestinal disorders.  \nTherefore, this co-administration \nshould be avoided unless judged \nstrictly necessary.  If this \nco-administration is judged \nunavoidable, increased dose of \nKaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice \ndaily may be administered with \nrifampicin under close safety and \ntherapeutic drug monitoring.  The \nKaletra dose should be titrated \nupward only after rifampicin has \nbeen initiated (see section 4.4). \n\nAntipsychotics \nLurasidone Due to CYP3A inhibition by \n\nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof lurasidone are expected to \nincrease. \n\nThe concomitant administration \nwith lurasidone is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n 95 \n\nPimozide Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof pimozide are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and pimozide is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nthe risk of serious haematologic \nabnormalities or other serious \nadverse effects from this agent (see \nsection 4.3) \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir, concentrations \nof quetiapine are expected to \nincrease. \n\nConcomitant administration of \nKaletra and quetiapine is \ncontraindicated as it may increase \nquetiapine-related toxicity. \n\nBenzodiazepines \nMidazolam \n \n\nOral Midazolam:  \nAUC: ↑ 13-fold  \nParenteral Midazolam: \nAUC: ↑ 4-fold \nDue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir \n \n \n\nKaletra must not be co-administered \nwith oral midazolam (see section \n4.3), whereas caution should be \nused with co-administration of \nKaletra and parenteral midazolam.  \nIf Kaletra is co-administered with \nparenteral midazolam, it should be \ndone in an intensive care unit (ICU) \nor similar setting which ensures \nclose clinical monitoring and \nappropriate medical management in \ncase of respiratory depression \nand/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage \nadjustment for midazolam should be \nconsidered especially if more than a \nsingle dose of midazolam is \nadministered. \n\nBeta2-adrenoceptor agonist (long acting) \nSalmeterol Salmeterol: \n\nConcentrations are expected to \nincrease due to CYP3A inhibition \nby lopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nThe combination may result in \nincreased risk of cardiovascular \nadverse events associated with \nsalmeterol, including QT \nprolongation, palpitations and sinus \ntachycardia. \nTherefore, concomitant \nadministration of Kaletra with \nsalmeterol is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nCalcium channel blockers \nFelodipine, Nifedipine, \nand Nicardipine \n\nFelodipine, Nifedipine, \nNicardipine: \nConcentrations may be increased \ndue to CYP3A inhibition by \nlopinavir/ritonavir. \n\nClinical monitoring of therapeutic \nand adverse effects is recommended \nwhen these medicines are \nconcomitantly administered with \nKaletra. \n\nCorticosteroids \nDexamethasone Lopinavir: \n\nConcentrations may be decreased \ndue to CYP3A induction by \ndexamethasone. \n \n\nClinical monitoring of antiviral \nefficacy is recommended when \nthese medicines are concomitantly \nadministered with Kaletra. \n\n\n\n 96 \n\nInhaled, injectable or \nintranasal fluticasone \npropionate, budesonide, \ntriamcinolone \n\nFluticasone propionate, 50 µg \nintranasal 4 times daily: \nPlasma concentrations ↑ \nCortisol levels ↓ 86%  \n \n\nGreater effects may be expected \nwhen fluticasone propionate is \ninhaled.  Systemic corticosteroid \neffects including Cushing's \nsyndrome and adrenal suppression \nhave been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or \nintranasally administered \nfluticasone propionate; this could \nalso occur with other corticosteroids \nmetabolised via the P450 3A \npathway e.g. budesonide and \ntriamcinolone.  Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of \nKaletra and these glucocorticoids is \nnot recommended unless the \npotential benefit of treatment \noutweighs the risk of systemic \ncorticosteroid effects (see section \n4.4).  A dose reduction of the \nglucocorticoid should be considered \nwith close monitoring of local and \nsystemic effects or a switch to a \nglucocorticoid, which is not a \nsubstrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone).

The prevalence of birth defects after any \ntrimester exposure to lopinavir is comparable to the prevalence observed in the general population.  \nNo pattern of birth defects suggestive of a common etiology was seen.  Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Based on the data mentioned, the malformative risk is unlikely \nin humans.  Lopinavir can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nBreastfeeding \nStudies in rats revealed that lopinavir is excreted in the milk.  It is not known whether this medicinal \nproduct is excreted in human milk.  As a general rule, it is recommended that mothers infected by HIV \ndo not breastfeed their babies under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.  \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown no effects on fertility.  No human data on the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir \non fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Patients \nshould be informed that nausea has been reported during treatment with Kaletra (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Kaletra has been investigated in over 2600 patients in Phase II-IV clinical trials, of \nwhich over 700 have received a dose of 800/200 mg (6 capsules or 4 tablets) once daily.  Along with \nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, Kaletra was used in combination \nwith efavirenz or nevirapine. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions related to Kaletra therapy during clinical trials were diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia.  The risk of diarrhoea may be \ngreater with once-daily dosing of Kaletra.  Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning \nof the treatment while hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later.  Treatment \nemergent adverse events led to premature study discontinuation for 7% of subjects from Phase II-IV \nstudies. \n \nIt is important to note that cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra, \nincluding those who developed hypertriglyceridaemia.  Furthermore, rare increases in PR interval have \nbeen reported during Kaletra therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 102 \n\nb.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nCushing’s syndrome has been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally \nadministered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via \nthe P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide (see section 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nIncreased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myalgia, myositis, and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been \nreported with protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 104 \n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nd. Paediatric populations \n \nIn children 2 years of age and older, the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults (see \nTable in section b).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nTo date, there is limited human experience of acute overdose with Kaletra. \n \nThe adverse clinical signs observed in dogs included salivation, emesis and diarrhoea/abnormal stool.  \nThe signs of toxicity observed in mice, rats or dogs included decreased activity, ataxia, emaciation, \ndehydration and tremors.  \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Kaletra.  Treatment of overdose with Kaletra is to \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance is to be achieved \nby emesis or gastric lavage.  Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal \nof unabsorbed active substance.  Since Kaletra is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR10  \n \nMechanism of action \nLopinavir provides the antiviral activity of Kaletra.  Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 \nproteases.  Inhibition of HIV protease prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein resulting in the \nproduction of immature, non-infectious virus.  \n \nEffects on the electrocardiogram \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 39 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF from placebo were 3.6 (6.3) and \n13.1(15.8) for 400/100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800/200 mg twice daily LPV/r, \nrespectively.  The induced QRS interval prolongation from 6 ms to 9.5 ms with high dose \nlopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg twice daily) contributes to QT prolongation.  The two regimens \nresulted in exposures on Day 3 which were approximately 1.5 and 3-fold higher than those observed \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 105 \n\nwith recommended once-daily or twice-daily LPV/r doses at steady state.  No subject experienced an \nincrease in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically \nrelevant threshold of 500 ms. \n \nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in the \nsame study on Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.6 ms to 24.4 ms \nin the 12 hour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 286 ms and no second or third degree \nheart block was observed (see section 4.4). \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \nThe in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against laboratory and clinical HIV strains was evaluated in \nacutely infected lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, respectively.  In the \nabsence of human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against five different HIV-1 laboratory strains \nwas 19 nM.  In the absence and presence of 50% human serum, the mean IC50 of lopinavir against \nHIV-1IIIB in MT4 cells was 17 nM and 102 nM, respectively.  In the absence of human serum, the \nmean IC50 of lopinavir was 6.5 nM against several HIV-1 clinical isolates. \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro selection of resistance \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in vitro.  HIV-1 has been \npassaged in vitro with lopinavir alone and with lopinavir plus ritonavir at concentration ratios \nrepresenting the range of plasma concentration ratios observed during Kaletra therapy.  Genotypic and \nphenotypic analysis of viruses selected in these passages suggest that the presence of ritonavir, at these \nconcentration ratios, does not measurably influence the selection of lopinavir-resistant viruses.  \nOverall, the in vitro characterisation of phenotypic cross-resistance between lopinavir and other \nprotease inhibitors suggest that decreased susceptibility to lopinavir correlated closely with decreased \nsusceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did not correlate closely with decreased susceptibility to \namprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in ARV-naïve patientsIn clinical studies with a limited number of isolates \nanalysed, the selection of resistance to lopinavir has not been observed in naïve patients without \nsignificant protease inhibitor resistance at baseline.  See further the detailed description of the clinical \nstudies. \n \nAnalysis of resistance in PI-experienced patients \nThe selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was \ncharacterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in \n2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral \nrebound subsequent to initial response to Kaletra and who demonstrated incremental in vitro resistance \nbetween baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in phenotypic \nsusceptibility to lopinavir).  Incremental resistance was most common in subjects whose baseline \nisolates had several protease inhibitor-associated mutations, but < 40-fold reduced susceptibility to \nlopinavir at baseline.  Mutations V82A, I54V and M46I emerged most frequently.  Mutations L33F, \nI50V and V32I combined with I47V/A were also observed.  The 19 isolates demonstrated a 4.3-fold \nincrease in IC50 compared to baseline isolates (from 6.2- to 43-fold, compared to wild-type virus). \n \nGenotypic correlates of reduced phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir in viruses selected by other \nprotease inhibitors.  The in vitro antiviral activity of lopinavir against 112 clinical isolates taken from \npatients failing therapy with one or more protease inhibitors was assessed.  Within this panel, the \nfollowing mutations in HIV protease were associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir: \nL10F/I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, M46I/L, F53L, I54L/T/V, L63P, A71I/L/T/V, V82A/F/T, I84V and \nL90M.  The median EC50 of lopinavir against isolates with 0 − 3, 4 − 5, 6 − 7 and 8 − 10 mutations at \nthe above amino acid positions was 0.8, 2.7 13.5 and 44.0-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type \nHIV, respectively.  The 16 viruses that displayed > 20-fold change in susceptibility all contained \nmutations at positions 10, 54, 63 plus 82 and/or 84.  In addition, they contained a median of 3 \nmutations at amino acid positions 20, 24, 46, 53, 71 and 90.  In addition to the mutations described \n\n\n\n 106 \n\nabove, mutations V32I and I47A have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir \nsusceptibility from protease inhibitor experienced patients receiving Kaletra therapy, and mutations \nI47A and L76V have been observed in rebound isolates with reduced lopinavir susceptibility from \npatients receiving Kaletra therapy. \n \nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results. \n \nAntiviral activity of Kaletra in patients failing protease inhibitor therapy \nThe clinical relevance of reduced in vitro susceptibility to lopinavir has been examined by assessing \nthe virologic response to Kaletra therapy, with respect to baseline viral genotype and phenotype, in 56 \npatients previous failing therapy with multiple protease inhibitors.  The EC50 of lopinavir against the \n56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0.6 to 96-fold higher than the EC50 against wild type HIV.  After \n48 weeks of treatment with Kaletra, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma \nHIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ml was observed in 93% (25/27), 73% (11/15), and 25% (2/8) of patients with \n< 10-fold, 10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively.  In \naddition, virologic response was observed in 91% (21/23), 71% (15/21) and 33% (2/6) patients with \n0 − 5, 6 − 7, and 8 − 10 mutations of the above mutations in HIV protease associated with reduced \nin vitro susceptibility to lopinavir.  Since these patients had not previously been exposed to either \nKaletra or efavirenz, part of the response may be attributed to the antiviral activity of efavirenz, \nparticularly in patients harbouring highly lopinavir resistant virus.  The study did not contain a control \narm of patients not receiving Kaletra. \n \nCross-resistance  \nActivity of other protease inhibitors against isolates that developed incremental resistance to lopinavir \nafter Kaletra therapy in protease inhibitor experienced patients: The presence of cross resistance to \nother protease inhibitors was analysed in 18 rebound isolates that had demonstrated evolution of \nresistance to lopinavir during 3 Phase II and one Phase III studies of Kaletra in protease inhibitor-\nexperienced patients.  The median fold IC50 of lopinavir for these 18 isolates at baseline and rebound \nwas 6.9- and 63-fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  In general, rebound isolates either \nretained (if cross-resistant at baseline) or developed significant cross-resistance to indinavir, \nsaquinavir and atazanavir.  Modest decreases in amprenavir activity were noted with a median \nincrease of IC50 from 3.7- to 8-fold in the baseline and rebound isolates, respectively.  Isolates retained \nsusceptibility to tipranavir with a median increase of IC50 in baseline and rebound isolates of 1.9- and \n1.8–fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.  Please refer to the Aptivus Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for additional information on the use of tipranavir, including genotypic predictors of \nresponse, in treatment of lopinavir-resistant HIV-1 infection. \n \nClinical results \nThe effects of Kaletra (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers (plasma \nHIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts) have been investigated in controlled studies of Kaletra of \n48 to 360 weeks duration.   \n \nAdult Use \n \nPatients without prior antiretroviral therapy \n \nStudy M98-863 was a randomised, double-blind trial of 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients \ninvestigating Kaletra (400/100 mg twice daily) compared to nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) plus \nstavudine and lamivudine.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 259 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to \n949 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.9 log10 copies/ml (range: 2.6 to \n6.8 log10 copies/ml).   \n \n\n\n\n 107 \n\nTable 1 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 48: Study M98-863 \n\n Kaletra (N=326) Nelfinavir (N=327) \nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml* 75% 63% \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml*† 67% 52% \nMean increase from baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n207 195 \n\n* intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures  \n† p < 0.001 \n\n \nOne-hundred thirteen nelfinavir-treated patients and 74 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients had an HIV \nRNA above 400 copies/ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96.  Of these, isolates \nfrom 96 nelfinavir-treated patients and 51 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients could be amplified for \nresistance testing.  Resistance to nelfinavir, defined as the presence of the D30N or L90M mutation in \nprotease, was observed in 41/96 (43%) patients.  Resistance to lopinavir, defined as the presence of \nany primary or active site mutations in protease (see above), was observed in 0/51 (0%) patients.  Lack \nof resistance to lopinavir was confirmed by phenotypic analysis. \n \nStudy M05-730 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial comparing treatment with Kaletra \n800/200 mg once daily plus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine versus Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily \nplus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine in 664 antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients.  Given the \npharmacokinetic interaction between Kaletra and tenofovir (see section 4.5), the results of this study \nmight not be strictly extrapolable when other backbone regimens are used with Kaletra.  Patients were \nrandomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Kaletra 800/200 mg once daily (n = 333) or Kaletra \n400/100 mg twice daily (n = 331).  Further stratification within each group was 1:1 (tablet versus soft \ncapsule).  Patients were administered either the tablet or the soft capsule formulation for 8 weeks, after \nwhich all patients were administered the tablet formulation once daily or twice daily for the remainder \nof the study.  Patients were administered emtricitabine 200 mg once daily and tenofovir DF 300 mg \nonce daily (equivalent to 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil).  Protocol defined non-inferiority of once-daily \ndosing compared with twice-daily dosing was demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence \ninterval for the difference in proportion of subjects responding (once daily minus twice daily) \nexcluded -12% at Week 48.  Mean age of patients enrolled was 39 years (range: 19 to 71); 75% were \nCaucasian, and 78% were male.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 216 cells/mm3 (range: 20 to \n775 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log10 copies/ml (range: 1.7 to \n7.0 log10 copies/ml).   \n \nTable 2 \n \n\nVirologic Response of Study Subjects at Week 48 and Week 96 \n\n Week 48 Week 96 \n QD BID  Difference \n\n[95% CI] \nQD BID  Difference \n\n[95% CI] \nNC= Failure 257/333 \n\n(77.2%) \n251/331 \n(75.8%) \n\n1.3 % \n[-5.1, 7.8] \n\n216/333 \n(64.9%) \n\n229/331 \n(69.2%) \n\n-4.3% \n[-11.5, 2.8] \n\nObserved data 257/295 \n(87.1%) \n\n250/280 \n(89.3%) \n\n-2.2% \n[-7.4, 3.1] \n\n216/247 \n(87.4%) \n\n229/248 \n(92.3%) \n\n-4.9% \n[-10.2, 0.4] \n\nMean increase from \nbaseline in CD4+ T-cell \ncount (cells/mm3) \n\n186 198  238 254  \n\n \nThrough Week 96, genotypic resistance testing results were available from 25 patients in the QD \ngroup and 26 patients in the BID group who had incomplete virologic response.

One hundred patients were originally treated with Kaletra in the study (including \n51 patients receiving 400/100 mg twice daily and 49 patients at either 200/100 mg twice daily or \n400/200 mg twice daily).  All patients converted to open-label Kaletra at the 400/100 mg twice daily \ndose between week 48 and week 72.  Thirty-nine patients (39%) discontinued the study, including 16 \n(16%) discontinuations due to adverse events, one of which was associated with a death.  Sixty-one \npatients completed the study (35 patients received the recommended 400/100 mg twice-daily dose \nthroughout the study).   \n \nTable 3 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 360: Study M97-720 \n\n Kaletra (N=100) \nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml 61% \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/ml 59% \nMean increase from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) 501 \n\n \nThrough 360 weeks of treatment, genotypic analysis of viral isolates was successfully conducted in 19 \nof 28 patients with confirmed HIV RNA above 400 copies/ml revealed no primary or active site \nmutations in protease (amino acids at positions 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 82, 84 and 90) or protease \ninhibitor phenotypic resistance \n \nPatients with prior antiretroviral therapy \n \nM06-802 was a randomised open-label study comparing the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of \nonce-daily and twice-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets in 599 subjects with detectable viral \nloads while receiving their current antiviral therapy.  Patients had not been on prior lopinavir/ritonavir \ntherapy.  They were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg once \ndaily (n = 300) or lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 299).  Patients were administered at \nleast two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors selected by the investigator.  The \nenrolled population was moderately PI-experienced with more than half of patients having never \nreceived prior PI and around 80% of patients presenting a viral strain with less than 3 PI mutations.  \nMean age of patients enrolled was 41 years (range: 21 to 73); 51% were Caucasian and 66% were \nmale.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 254 cells/mm3 (range: 4 to 952 cells/mm3) and mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10 copies/ml (range: 1.7 to 6.6 log10 copies/ml).

In the QD group, \n\n\n\n 109 \n\n6/75 (8%) patients demonstrated new primary protease inhibitor mutations (codons 30, 32, 48, 50, 82, \n84, 90), as did 12/77 (16%) patients in the BID group. \n \nPaediatric Use \n \nM98-940 was an open-label study of a liquid formulation of Kaletra in 100 antiretroviral naïve (44%) \nand experienced (56%) paediatric patients.  All patients were non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor naïve.  Patients were randomised to either 230 mg lopinavir/57.5 mg ritonavir per m2 or \n300 mg lopinavir/75 mg ritonavir per m2.  Naïve patients also received nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors.  Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors.  Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after \n3 weeks of therapy in each patient.  Subsequently, all patients were continued on the 300/75 mg per m2 \ndose.  Patients had a mean age of 5 years (range 6 months to 12 years) with 14 patients less than 2 \nyears old and 6 patients one year or less.  Mean baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 838 cells/mm3 and \nmean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.7 log10 copies/ml.   \n \nTable 5 \n \n\nOutcomes at Week 48: Study M98-940 \n\n Antiretroviral Naïve \n(N=44) \n\nAntiretroviral \nExperienced (N=56) \n\nHIV RNA < 400 copies/ml 84% 75% \nMean increase from baseline in \nCD4+ T-cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n404 284 \n\n \nKONCERT/PENTA 18 is a prospective multicentre, randomised, open-label study that evaluated the \npharmacokinetic profile, efficacy and safety of twice-daily versus once-daily dosing of \nlopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg tablets dosed by weight as part of combination antiretroviral therapy \n(cART) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children (n=173).  Children were eligible when \nthey were aged <18 years, ≥15 kg in weight, receiving cART that included lopinavir/ritonavir, HIV-1 \nribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/ml for at least 24 weeks and able to swallow tablets.  At week 48, \nthe efficacy and safety with twice-daily dosing (n=87) in the paediatric population given \nlopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg tablets was consistent with the efficacy and safety findings in \nprevious adult and paediatric studies using lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily.  The percentage of patients \nwith confirmed viral rebound >50 copies/ml during 48 weeks of follow-up was higher in the paediatric \npatients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets once daily (12%) than in patients receiving the twice-daily \ndosing (8%, p = 0.19), mainly due to lower adherence in the once-daily group.  The efficacy data \nfavouring the twice-daily regimen are reinforced by a differential in pharmacokinetic parameters \nsignificantly favouring the twice-daily regimen (see section 5.2).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lopinavir co-administered with ritonavir have been evaluated in \nhealthy adult volunteers and in HIV-infected patients; no substantial differences were observed \nbetween the two groups.  Lopinavir is essentially completely metabolised by CYP3A.  Ritonavir \ninhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, thereby increasing the plasma levels of lopinavir.  Across studies, \nadministration of Kaletra 400/100 mg twice daily yields mean steady-state lopinavir plasma \nconcentrations 15 to 20-fold higher than those of ritonavir in HIV-infected patients.  The plasma levels \nof ritonavir are less than 7% of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily.  The \nin vitro antiviral EC50 of lopinavir is approximately 10-fold lower than that of ritonavir.  Therefore, the \nantiviral activity of Kaletra is due to lopinavir. \n \nAbsorption \nMultiple dosing with 400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily for 2 weeks and without meal restriction \nproduced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 12.3 ± 5.4 µg/ml, occurring \napproximately 4 hours after administration.  The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nmorning dose was 8.1 ± 5.7 µg/ml.  Lopinavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n113.2 ± 60.5 µg•h/ml.  The absolute bioavailability of lopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir in \nhumans has not been established. \n \nEffects of food on oral absorption \nAdministration of a single 400/100 mg dose of Kaletra tablets under fed conditions (high fat, 872 kcal, \n56% from fat) compared to fasted state was associated with no significant changes in Cmax and AUCinf.  \nTherefore, Kaletra tablets may be taken with or without food.  Kaletra tablets have also shown less \npharmacokinetic variability under all meal conditions compared to Kaletra soft capsules. \n \nDistribution \nAt steady state, lopinavir is approximately 98 − 99% bound to serum proteins.  Lopinavir binds to both \nalpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin however, it has a higher affinity for AAG.  At steady \nstate, lopinavir protein binding remains constant over the range of observed concentrations after \n400/100 mg Kaletra twice daily, and is similar between healthy volunteers and HIV-positive patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicate that lopinavir primarily undergoes \noxidative metabolism.  Lopinavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, \nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A.  Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor which inhibits the \nmetabolism of lopinavir and therefore, increases plasma levels of lopinavir.  A 14C-lopinavir study in \nhumans showed that 89% of the plasma radioactivity after a single 400/100 mg Kaletra dose was due \nto parent active substance.  At least 13 lopinavir oxidative metabolites have been identified in man.  \nThe 4-oxo and 4-hydroxymetabolite epimeric pair are the major metabolites with antiviral activity, but \ncomprise only minute amounts of total plasma radioactivity.  Ritonavir has been shown to induce \nmetabolic enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism, and likely the induction of \nlopinavir metabolism.  Pre-dose lopinavir concentrations decline with time during multiple dosing, \nstabilising after approximately 10 days to 2 weeks. \n \nElimination \nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-lopinavir/ritonavir dose, approximately 10.4 ± 2.3% and 82.6 ± 2.5% of an \nadministered dose of 14C-lopinavir can be accounted for in urine and faeces, respectively.  Unchanged \nlopinavir accounted for approximately 2.2% and 19.8% of the administered dose in urine and faeces, \nrespectively.  After multiple dosing, less than 3% of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the \nurine.  The effective (peak to trough) half-life of lopinavir over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged \n5 − 6 hours, and the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of lopinavir is 6 to 7 l/h. \n \nOnce-daily dosing: the pharmacokinetics of once daily Kaletra have been evaluated in HIV-infected \nsubjects naïve to antiretroviral treatment.  Kaletra 800/200 mg was administered in combination with \nemtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg as part of a once-daily regimen.  Multiple dosing of \n800/200 mg Kaletra once daily for 2 weeks without meal restriction (n=16) produced a mean ± SD \nlopinavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 14.8 ± 3.5 µg/ml, occurring approximately 6 hours after \nadministration.  The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the morning dose was \n5.5 ± 5.4 µg/ml.  Lopinavir AUC over a 24 hour dosing interval averaged 206.5 ± 89.7 µg•h/ml. \n \nAs compared to the BID regimen, the once-daily dosing is associated with a reduction in the \nCmin/Ctrough values of approximately 50%.   \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nPaediatrics \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in children below 2 years of age.  The pharmacokinetics of \nKaletra 100/25 mg tablet twice-daily weight-band dosing without nevirapine have been studied in a \ntotal of 53 paediatric patients.  The lopinavir mean ± standard deviation steady-state AUC, Cmax and \nC12 were 112.5 ± 37.1 μg•h/ml, 12.4 ± 3.5 μg/ml and 5.71 ± 2.99 μg/ml, respectively. The twice-daily \nweight-band dosing without nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those \nobtained in adult patients receiving the 400/100 mg twice-daily regimen without nevirapine.   \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n \nGender, Race and Age   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in older people.  No age or gender related \npharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients.  Pharmacokinetic differences due to \nrace have not been identified. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \nIn an open-label pharmacokinetic study, 12 HIV-infected pregnant women who were less than 20 \nweeks of gestation and on combination antiretroviral therapy initially received lopinavir/ritonavir 400 \nmg/100 mg (two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily up to a gestational age of 30 weeks. At 30 weeks age \nof gestation, the dose was increased to 500/125 mg (two 200/50 mg tablets plus one 100/25 mg tablet) \ntwice daily until subjects were 2 weeks postpartum. Plasma concentrations of lopinavir were measured \nover four 12-hour periods during second trimester (20-24 weeks gestation), third trimester before dose \nincrease (30 weeks gestation), third trimester after dose increase (32 weeks gestation), and at 8 weeks \npost-partum. The dose increase did not result in a significant increase in the plasma lopinavir \nconcentration.  \n \nIn another open-label pharmacokinetic study, 19 HIV-infected pregnant women received \nlopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily as part of combination antiretroviral therapy during \npregnancy from before conception. A series of blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals \nover the course of 12 hours in trimester 2 and trimester 3, at birth, and 4–6 weeks postpartum (in \nwomen who continued treatment post-delivery) for pharmacokinetic analysis of total and unbound \nlevels of plasma lopinavir concentrations. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic data from HIV-1 infected pregnant women receiving lopinavir/ritonavir tablets \n400/100 mg twice daily are presented in Table 6 (see section 4.2). \n \nTable 6 \n \n\nMean (%CV) Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Lopinavir  \nin HIV-Infected Pregnant Women \n\nPharmacokinetic \nParameter \n\n2nd Trimester \nn = 17* \n\n3rd Trimester \nn = 23 \n\nPostpartum \nn = 17** \n\nAUC0-12 μg•hr/mL 68.7 (20.6) 61.3 (22.7) 94.3 (30.3) \nCmax 7.9 (21.1) 7.5 (18.7) 9.8 (24.3) \n\nCpredose μg /mL 4.7 (25.2) 4.3 (39.0) 6.5 (40.4) \n*   n = 18 for Cmax                  ** n = 16 for Cpredose \n\n \nRenal Insufficiency   \nKaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, since \nthe renal clearance of lopinavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in \npatients with renal insufficiency. \n \nHepatic Insufficiency \nThe steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir in HIV-infected patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment were compared with those of HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic \nfunction in a multiple dose study with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily.  A limited increase \nin total lopinavir concentrations of approximately 30% has been observed which is not expected to be \nof clinical relevance (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs identified major target organs as the liver, kidney, \nthyroid, spleen and circulating red blood cells.  Hepatic changes indicated cellular swelling with focal \ndegeneration.  While exposure eliciting these changes were comparable to or below human clinical \nexposure, dosages in animals were over 6-fold the recommended clinical dose.  Mild renal tubular \ndegeneration was confined to mice exposed with at least twice the recommended human exposure; the \n\n\n\n 112 \n\nkidney was unaffected in rats and dogs.  Reduced serum thyroxin led to an increased release of TSH \nwith resultant follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid glands of rats.  These changes were reversible \nwith withdrawal of the active substance and were absent in mice and dogs.  Coombs-negative \nanisocytosis and poikilocytosis were observed in rats, but not in mice or dogs.  Enlarged spleens with \nhistiocytosis were seen in rats but not other species.  Serum cholesterol was elevated in rodents but not \ndogs, while triglycerides were elevated only in mice.  \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channels (HERG) were inhibited by 30% at \nthe highest concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir tested, corresponding to a lopinavir exposure 7-fold \ntotal and 15-fold free peak plasma levels achieved in humans at the maximum recommended \ntherapeutic dose.  In contrast, similar concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no \nrepolarisation delay in the canine cardiac Purkinje fibres.  Lower concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir \ndid not produce significant potassium (HERG) current blockade.  Tissue distribution studies \nconducted in the rat did not suggest significant cardiac retention of the active substance; 72-hour AUC \nin heart was approximately 50% of measured plasma AUC.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that \ncardiac lopinavir levels would not be significantly higher than plasma levels. \n \nIn dogs, prominent U waves on the electrocardiogram have been observed associated with prolonged \nPR interval and bradycardia.  These effects have been assumed to be caused by electrolyte \ndisturbance.   \n \nThe clinical relevance of these preclinical data is unknown, however, the potential cardiac effects of \nthis product in humans cannot be ruled out (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nIn rats, embryofoetotoxicity (pregnancy loss, decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal body weights, \nincreased frequency of skeletal variations) and postnatal developmental toxicity (decreased survival of \npups) was observed at maternally toxic dosages.  The systemic exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir at the \nmaternal and developmental toxic dosages was lower than the intended therapeutic exposure in \nhumans.   \n \nLong-term carcinogenicity studies of lopinavir/ritonavir in mice revealed a nongenotoxic, mitogenic \ninduction of liver tumours, generally considered to have little relevance to human risk.   \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in rats revealed no tumourigenic findings.  Lopinavir/ritonavir was not found \nto be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial \nreverse mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal \naberration assays in human lymphocytes. \n \n \n6.

Fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints \nmay be taken under doctor’s supervision (see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section on \nOther medicines and Kaletra); \n\n• elbasvir/grazoprevir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV]); \n• ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \n\nvirus [HCV]); \n• neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n• avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); \n• sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\nartery).  Sildenafil used to treat erectile dysfunction may be taken under doctor’s supervision \n(see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nRead the list of medicines below under ‘Other medicines and Kaletra’ for information on certain \nother medicines which require special care. \n \nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about making necessary changes \neither in the treatment for your other condition(s) or in your antiretroviral treatment.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kaletra. \n \nImportant information \n \n• People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease \n\nand AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while \ntaking Kaletra.   \n\n• You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid \ninfecting other people. \n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your child have/had \n \n• Haemophilia type A and B as Kaletra might increase the risk of bleeding. \n• Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving Kaletra. \n• A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects. \n \nTell your doctor if you or your child experience \n \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in \n\nthe legs and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels. \n• Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels \n\nin the blood. \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the \n\nblood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and \nthese symptoms may suggest this condition. \n\n• In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \n\n\n\n 142 \n\nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune \nresponse, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. \n\n• In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n• Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression (reduction in the activity of the immune system), higher body mass index, \namong others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.   \n\n• Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines.  On \nrare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  \n\n• Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats.  Kaletra \nmay cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart.  These changes \nmay be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram). \n\n \nOther medicines and Kaletra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take \nany other medicines.  \n• antibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, rifampicin, clarithromycin); \n• anticancer medicines (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, ibrutinib, \n\nvenetoclax, most tyrosine kinases inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib, also vincristine and \nvinblastine); \n\n• anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, rivaroxaban, vorapaxar); \n• antidepressants (e.g. trazodone, bupropion); \n• anti-epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine and \n\nvalproate); \n• antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole); \n• anti-gout medicines (e.g. colchicine).  You must not take Kaletra with colchicine if you have \n\nkidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Kaletra’ above); \n• anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline, delamanid); \n• antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir); \n• erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil and tadalafil); \n• fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints (e.g. osteomyelitis); \n• heart medicines including: \n\n− digoxin; \n− calcium channel antagonists (e.g. felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine); \n− medicines used to correct heart rhythm (e.g. bepridil, systemic lidocaine, quinidine); \n\n• HIV CCR5-antagonist (e.g. maraviroc); \n• HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (e.g. raltegravir); \n• medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib); \n• levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems); \n• medicines used to lower blood cholesterol (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin or \n\nsimvastatin); \n• medicines used to treat asthma and other lung-related problems such as chronic obstructive \n\npulmonary disease (COPD) (e.g. salmeterol); \n\n\n\n 143 \n\n• medicines used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \nartery) (e.g. bosentan, riociguat, sildenafil, tadalafil); \n\n• medicines affecting the immune system (e.g. cyclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin), tacrolimus); \n• medicines used for smoking cessation (e.g. bupropion); \n• pain-relieving medicines (e.g. fentanyl); \n• morphine-like medicines (e.g. methadone); \n• oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy (see section below titled \n\nContraceptives); \n• protease inhibitors (e.g. fosamprenavir, indinavir,  ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir); \n• sedatives (e.g. midazolam administered by injection); \n• steroids (e.g. budesonide, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, ethinyl oestradiol, \n\ntriamcinolone); \n• medicines that cause a reaction with alcohol (e.g. disulfiram). \n \nRead the list of medicines above ‘Do not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines’ for \ninformation on medicines that you must not take with Kaletra. \n \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take \nany other medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription. \n \nErectile dysfunction medicines (avanafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil) \n \n• Do not take Kaletra if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil. \n• You must not take Kaletra with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high \n\nblood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Kaletra section above). \n• If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and Kaletra together, you may be at risk of side effects such as \n\nlow blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours.  \nIf an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid \npermanent damage to your penis.  Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. \n\n \nContraceptives \n \n• If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent \n\npregnancy, you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as \nKaletra may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n• Kaletra does not reduce the risk of passing HIV to others.  Appropriate precautions (e.g. use of a \ncondom) should be taken to prevent passing on the disease through sexual contact. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you \n\nmay be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.   \n• If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this \n\nmedicine because it contains propylene glycol and alcohol.  Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers \nshould not take Kaletra oral solution unless specifically directed by the doctor.   \n\n• It is recommended that HIV-infected women do not breast-feed their infants because there is a \npossibility that the baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk. \n\n \nDriving or using machines \n \nKaletra has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or operate \nmachines.  Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) \nthat impact your ability to do so safely.  Instead, contact your doctor. \n \nKaletra contains 42% v/v alcohol.  The amount of alcohol in this medicine may affect your ability to \ndrive or use machines and may affect your judgement and reaction times. \n\n\n\n 144 \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Kaletra \n \nKaletra contains 42% v/v alcohol and 15% propylene glycol w/v.  Each 1 ml of Kaletra oral solution \ncontains 356.3 mg of alcohol and 152.7 mg of propylene glycol.  Alcohol and propylene glycol are \npotentially harmful for those suffering from liver disease, kidney disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, brain \ninjury or disease, as well as for pregnant women and children.  They may modify or increase the effect \nof other medicines. \n \nAt the recommended adult dose(s) of this medicine, the estimated blood alcohol concentration in your \nbody is about 0.002 - 0.01 g/dL.  This is similar to an adult drinking 4-22 ml of beer or 1-4 ml of wine.   \n \nOther medicines may also contain alcohol and alcohol may be consumed in food and drinks.  The \ncombined effects may lead to increased blood alcohol levels and increase the side effects of alcohol. \n \nThis medicinal product contains up to 0.8 g of fructose per dose when taken according to the dosage \nrecommendations.  Unsuitable in hereditary fructose intolerance.  Due to the possibility of undetected \nfructose intolerance, this medicinal product should only be given to babies and infants after \nconsultation with a doctor. \n \nKaletra contains glycerol which is harmful in high doses.  Can cause headache and stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \nKaletra contains polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil.  This may cause nausea, vomiting, colic, severe \npurgation at high doses.  It should not be given when intestinal obstruction is present. \n \nKaletra contains potassium as acesulfame potassium, which may be harmful to people on a low \npotassium diet.  High potassium in the blood can cause stomach upset and diarrhoea. \n \nKaletra contains sodium as saccharin sodium, sodium chloride and sodium citrate, which may be \nharmful to people on a low sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to take Kaletra \n \n Kaletra is recommended for use in adults and children 14 days of age and older who are infected \n\nwith HIV. \n Take care when dosing children.  Dosing should be less than 5 ml twice daily for children weighing \n\nless than 40 kg. \n \nIf you or your child is able to swallow tablets, Kaletra is also supplied as film-coated tablets \ncontaining 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir and film-coated tablets containing 100 mg of \nlopinavir and 25 mg of ritonavir. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure how you should take your medicine. \n \nHow much Kaletra should be taken and when? \n \nFor children 14 days and older and weighing up to 15 kg \n• Your doctor will decide the right dose based on the child’s height and weight.   \n• It is important that all doses of Kaletra oral solution are taken with food. \n• Use the 2 ml oral syringe provided to measure the dose. \n \nFor children weighing more than 15 kg \n \n• Your doctor will decide the right dose based on the child’s height and weight.   \n\n\n\n 145 \n\n• It is important that all doses of Kaletra oral solution are taken with food. \n• Use the 5 ml oral syringe provided to measure the dose. \n \nUse in adults \n \n• The usual adult dose is 5 ml of the oral solution twice a day i.e. every 12 hours, in combination \n\nwith other anti-HIV medicines.

If you are not sure how to use \nthe oral dosing syringe ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  They will tell you how to use the syringe \ncorrectly.   \n \nDo not shake the bottle – this is because air bubbles can form which will affect how well you can \nmeasure the dose.   \n \nOpen the child-proof cap by pushing down on it with your palm and twisting it counter clockwise, or \nin the direction of the arrow on the top of the cap.  Talk to your pharmacist if you have difficulty \nopening the bottle. \n \n\n \n \n \nUsing the 2 ml oral dosing syringe for doses up to 2 ml  \n \nThe syringe has two \nmain parts, a ‘plunger’ \nand a ‘barrel’. In this \npicture we have pulled \nout the plunger so that \nyou can see each part \nclearly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCollar \n\nPlunger \n\nBarrel \n\nTip \n\n\n\n 146 \n\n \n1.

Place the dosing syringe in your child’s mouth towards the \ncheek and gently push the plunger down to release the \nmedicine. \n\nReplace the bottle cap after each dose.  \n \nAfter each dose of Kaletra separate the plunger and the syringe.  Wash the plunger and the syringe \nwith washing up liquid and warm water as soon as you can; you may soak both in soapy water for up \nto 15 minutes.  Rinse the syringe and plunger with clean water.  Put the syringe back together and \ndraw up and expel tap water a few times to rinse.  Let the syringe dry completely before you use that \nsyringe for dosing.  \n \nDo not use the dosing syringes supplied with Kaletra oral solution to administer any other medicines \nyou or your child may be taking.  \n \nIf you or your child take more Kaletra than you should \n \n• If you realise you have taken more Kaletra than you were supposed to, contact your doctor right \n\naway.   \n• If you cannot contact your doctor, go to the hospital. \n \nIf you or your child forget to take Kaletra \n \n− If you notice you miss a dose within 6 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed dose \n\nas soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as prescribed \nby your doctor. \n\n \n− If you notice you miss a dose by more than 6 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Take the next dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you or your child stop taking Kaletra \n \n• Do not stop or change the daily dose of Kaletra without first consulting with your doctor. \n• Kaletra should always be taken twice every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter \n\nhow much better you feel.   \n• Taking Kaletra as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the development \n\nof resistance to the product. \n• If a side effect is preventing you from taking Kaletra as directed tell your doctor right away.  \n• Always keep enough Kaletra on hand so you don’t run out.  When you travel or need to stay in \n\nthe hospital make sure you will have enough Kaletra to last until you can get a new supply. \n• Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Kaletra can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  It may be \ndifficult to tell which side effects have been caused by Kaletra and which may occur due to other \nmedicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the HIV infection.   \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported by patients who took this medicine.  You should tell \nyour doctor promptly about these or any other symptoms.

What Kaletra is and what it is used for \n \n• Your doctor has prescribed Kaletra to help to control your Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n\n(HIV) infection.  Kaletra does this by slowing down the spread of the infection in your body. \n• Kaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. \n• Kaletra is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected with \n\nHIV, the virus which causes AIDS.   \n• Kaletra contains the active substances lopinavir and ritonavir.  Kaletra is an antiretroviral \n\nmedicine.  It belongs to a group of medicines called protease inhibitors. \n• Kaletra is prescribed for use in combination with other antiviral medicines.  Your doctor will \n\ndiscuss with you and determine which medicines are best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Kaletra \n \nDo not take Kaletra \n• if you are allergic to lopinavir, ritonavir or any of the other ingredients of Kaletra (see section \n\n6);  \n• if you have severe liver problems. \n \nDo not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines: \n• astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may be \n\navailable without prescription); \n• midazolam taken orally (taken by mouth), triazolam (used to relieve anxiety and/or trouble \n\nsleeping); \n• pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); \n• quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \n• lurasidone (used to treat depression); \n• ranolazine (used to treat chronic chest pain [angina]); \n• cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); \n• ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat headaches); \n• amiodarone, dronedarone (used to treat abnormal heart beat); \n• lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n\n\n\n 153 \n\n• lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n• alfuzosin (used in men to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia \n\n(BPH)); \n• fusidic acid (used to treat skin infections caused by Staphylococcus bacteria such as impetigo \n\nand infected dermatitis).  Fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints \nmay be taken under doctor’s supervision (see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section on \nOther medicines and Kaletra); \n\n• elbasvir/grazoprevir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV]); \n• ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \n\nvirus [HCV]); \n• neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n• avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); \n• sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\nartery).  Sildenafil used to treat erectile dysfunction may be taken under doctor’s supervision \n(see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nRead the list of medicines below under ‘Other medicines and Kaletra’ for information on certain \nother medicines which require special care. \n \nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about making necessary changes \neither in the treatment for your other condition(s) or in your antiretroviral treatment.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kaletra. \n \nImportant information \n \n• People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease \n\nand AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while \ntaking Kaletra.   \n\n• You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid \ninfecting other people. \n \n\nTell your doctor if you or your child have/had \n \n• Haemophilia type A and B as Kaletra might increase the risk of bleeding. \n• Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving Kaletra. \n• A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects. \n \nTell your doctor if you or your child experience \n \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in \n\nthe legs and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels. \n• Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels \n\nin the blood. \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the \n\nblood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and \nthese symptoms may suggest this condition. \n\n• In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted.  It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune \n\n\n\n 154 \n\nresponse, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. \n\n• In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n• Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression (reduction in the activity of the immune system), higher body mass index, \namong others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.   \n\n• Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines.  On \nrare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  \n\n• Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats.  Kaletra \nmay cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart.  These changes \nmay be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram). \n\n \nOther medicines and Kaletra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take \nany other medicines.  \n• antibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, rifampicin, clarithromycin); \n• anticancer medicines (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, ibrutinib, \n\nvenetoclax, most tyrosine kinases inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib, also vincristine and \nvinblastine); \n\n• anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, rivaroxaban, vorapaxar); \n• antidepressants (e.g. trazodone, bupropion); \n• anti-epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine and \n\nvalproate); \n• antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole); \n• anti-gout medicines (e.g. colchicine).  You must not take Kaletra with colchicine if you have \n\nkidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Kaletra’ above); \n• anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline, delamanid); \n• antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir); \n• erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil and tadalafil); \n• fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints (e.g. osteomyelitis); \n• heart medicines including: \n\n− digoxin; \n− calcium channel antagonists (e.g. felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine); \n− medicines used to correct heart rhythm (e.g. bepridil, systemic lidocaine, quinidine); \n\n• HIV CCR5-antagonist (e.g. maraviroc); \n• HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (e.g. raltegravir); \n• medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib); \n• levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems); \n• medicines used to lower blood cholesterol (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin or \n\nsimvastatin);  \n• medicines used to treat asthma and other lung-related problems such as chronic obstructive \n\npulmonary disease (COPD) (e.g. salmeterol); \n• medicines used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\nartery) (e.g. bosentan, riociguat, sildenafil, tadalafil); \n\n\n\n 155 \n\n• medicines affecting the immune system (e.g. cyclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin), tacrolimus); \n• medicines used for smoking cessation (e.g. bupropion); \n• pain-relieving medicines (e.g. fentanyl); \n• morphine-like medicines (e.g. methadone); \n• non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (e.g. efavirenz, nevirapine); \n• oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy (see section below titled \n\nContraceptives); \n• protease inhibitors (e.g. fosamprenavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir); \n• sedatives (e.g. midazolam administered by injection); \n• steroids (e.g. budesonide, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, ethinyl oestradiol, \n\ntriamcinolone). \n \nRead the list of medicines above ‘Do not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines’ for \ninformation on medicines that you must not take with Kaletra. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription. \n \nErectile dysfunction medicines (avanafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil) \n \n• Do not take Kaletra if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil. \n• You must not take Kaletra with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high \n\nblood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Kaletra section above). \n• If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and Kaletra together, you may be at risk of side effects such as \n\nlow blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours.  \nIf an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid \npermanent damage to your penis.  Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. \n\n \nContraceptives \n \n• If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent \n\npregnancy, you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as \nKaletra may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n• Kaletra does not reduce the risk of passing HIV to others.  Appropriate precautions (e.g. use of a \ncondom) should be taken to prevent passing on the disease through sexual contact. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you \n\nmay be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.   \n• Breast-feeding mothers should not take Kaletra unless specifically directed by the doctor.   \n• It is recommended that HIV-infected women do not breast-feed their infants because there is a \n\npossibility that the baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk. \n \nDriving or using machines \n \nKaletra has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or operate \nmachines.  Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) \nthat impact your ability to do so safely.  Instead, contact your doctor. \n \n \n3. How to take Kaletra \n \n\nIt is important that Kaletra tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n \n\n\n\n 156 \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure how you should take your medicine. \n \nHow much Kaletra should be taken and when? \n \nUse in adults \n \n• The usual adult dose is 400 mg/100 mg twice a day i.e. every 12 hours, in combination with \n\nother anti-HIV medicines.  Adult patients who have not previously taken other antiviral \nmedicines can also take Kaletra tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose.  Your doctor will \nadvise on the number of tablets to be taken.  Adult patients who have previously taken other \nantiviral medicines can take Kaletra tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose if their doctor \ndecides it is appropriate. \n\n• Kaletra must not be taken once daily with efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, phenobarbital \nand phenytoin. \n\n• Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nUse in children \n \n• For children, your doctor will decide the right dose (number of tablets) based on the child’s \n\nheight and weight.   \n• Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nKaletra is also supplied as 100 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets.  Kaletra oral solution is available for \npatients who cannot take tablets. \n \nIf you or your child take more Kaletra than you should \n \n• If you realise you have taken more Kaletra than you were supposed to, contact your doctor right \n\naway.   \n• If you cannot contact your doctor, go to the hospital. \n \nIf you or your child forget to take Kaletra \n \nIf you are taking Kaletra twice a day \n− If you notice you miss a dose within 6 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed dose \n\nas soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as prescribed \nby your doctor. \n\n \n− If you notice you miss a dose by more than 6 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Take the next dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you are taking Kaletra once a day \n− If you notice you miss a dose within 12 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed \n\ndose as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as \nprescribed by your doctor. \n\n \n− If you notice you miss a dose by more than 12 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Take the next dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you or your child stop taking Kaletra \n \n• Do not stop or change the daily dose of Kaletra without first consulting with your doctor. \n\n\n\n 157 \n\n• Kaletra should always be taken every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter how \nmuch better you feel.   \n\n• Taking Kaletra as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the development \nof resistance to the product. \n\n• If a side effect is preventing you from taking Kaletra as directed tell your doctor right away.  \n• Always keep enough Kaletra on hand so you don’t run out.  When you travel or need to stay in \n\nthe hospital make sure you will have enough Kaletra to last until you can get a new supply. \n• Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Kaletra can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  It may be \ndifficult to tell which side effects have been caused by Kaletra and which may occur due to other \nmedicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the HIV infection.   \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported by patients who took this medicine.

What Kaletra is and what it is used for \n \n• Your doctor has prescribed Kaletra to help to control your Human Immunodeficiency Virus \n\n(HIV) infection.  Kaletra does this by slowing down the spread of the infection in your body. \n• Kaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. \n• Kaletra is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected with \n\nHIV, the virus which causes AIDS.   \n• Kaletra contains the active substances lopinavir and ritonavir.  Kaletra is an antiretroviral \n\nmedicine.  It belongs to a group of medicines called protease inhibitors. \n• Kaletra is prescribed for use in combination with other antiviral medicines.  Your doctor will \n\ndiscuss with you and determine which medicines are best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Kaletra \n \nDo not take Kaletra \n• if you are allergic to lopinavir, ritonavir or any of the other ingredients of Kaletra (see section \n\n6);  \n• if you have severe liver problems. \n \nDo not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines: \n• astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may be \n\navailable without prescription); \n• midazolam taken orally (taken by mouth), triazolam (used to relieve anxiety and/or trouble \n\nsleeping); \n• pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); \n• quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \n• lurasidone (used to treat depression); \n• ranolazine (used to treat chronic chest pain [angina]); \n• cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); \n• ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat headaches); \n• amiodarone, dronedarone (used to treat abnormal heart beat); \n• lovastatin, simvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n\n\n\n 163 \n\n• lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n• alfuzosin (used in men to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia \n\n(BPH)); \n• fusidic acid (used to treat skin infections caused by Staphylococcus bacteria such as impetigo \n\nand infected dermatitis).  Fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints \nmay be taken under doctor’s supervision (see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section on \nOther medicines and Kaletra); \n\n• elbasvir/grazoprevir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV]); \n• ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \n\nvirus [HCV]); \n• neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n• avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); \n• sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\nartery).  Sildenafil used to treat erectile dysfunction may be taken under doctor’s supervision \n(see Other medicines and Kaletra section); \n\n• products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nRead the list of medicines below under ‘Other medicines and Kaletra’ for information on certain \nother medicines which require special care. \n \nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about making necessary changes \neither in the treatment for your other condition(s) or in your antiretroviral treatment.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kaletra. \n \nImportant information \n \n• People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease \n\nand AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while \ntaking Kaletra.   \n\n• You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid \ninfecting other people. \n\n \nTell your doctor if you or your child have/had \n \n• Haemophilia type A and B as Kaletra might increase the risk of bleeding. \n• Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving Kaletra. \n• A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic \n\nhepatitis B or C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects. \n \nTell your doctor if you or your child experience \n \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in \n\nthe legs and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels. \n• Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels \n\nin the blood. \n• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the \n\nblood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and \nthese symptoms may suggest this condition. \n\n• In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and \nsymptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted.  It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune \n\n\n\n 164 \n\nresponse, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms.  \n\n• In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n• Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression (reduction in the activity of the immune system), higher body mass index, \namong others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.   \n\n• Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines.  On \nrare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  \n\n• Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats.  Kaletra \nmay cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart.  These changes \nmay be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram). \n\n \nOther medicines and Kaletra \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take \nany other medicines.  \n• antibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, rifampicin, clarithromycin); \n• anticancer medicines (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, ibrutinib, \n\nvenetoclax, most tyrosine kinases inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib, also vincristine and \nvinblastine); \n\n• anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, rivaroxaban, vorapaxar); \n• antidepressants (e.g. trazodone, bupropion); \n• anti-epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine and \n\nvalproate); \n• antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole); \n• anti-gout medicines (e.g. colchicine).  You must not take Kaletra with colchicine if you have \n\nkidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Kaletra’ above); \n• anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline, delamanid); \n• antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir); \n• erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil and tadalafil); \n• fusidic acid used to treat long-term infections of the bones and joints (e.g. osteomyelitis); \n• heart medicines including: \n\n− digoxin; \n− calcium channel antagonists (e.g. felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine); \n− medicines used to correct heart rhythm (e.g. bepridil, systemic lidocaine, quinidine); \n\n• HIV CCR5-antagonist (e.g. maraviroc); \n• HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (e.g. raltegravir); \n• medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib); \n• levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems); \n• medicines used to lower blood cholesterol (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin or \n\nsimvastatin);  \n• medicines used to treat asthma and other lung-related problems such as chronic obstructive \n\npulmonary disease (COPD) (e.g. salmeterol); \n• medicines used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\nartery) (e.g. bosentan, riociguat, sildenafil, tadalafil); \n\n\n\n 165 \n\n• medicines affecting the immune system (e.g. cyclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin), tacrolimus); \n• medicines used for smoking cessation (e.g. bupropion); \n• pain-relieving medicines (e.g. fentanyl); \n• morphine-like medicines (e.g. methadone); \n• non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (e.g. efavirenz, nevirapine); \n• oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy (see section below titled \n\nContraceptives); \n• protease inhibitors (e.g. fosamprenavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir); \n• sedatives (e.g. midazolam administered by injection); \n• steroids (e.g. budesonide, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, ethinyl oestradiol, \n\ntriamcinolone). \n \nRead the list of medicines above ‘Do not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines’ for \ninformation on medicines that you must not take with Kaletra. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription. \n \nErectile dysfunction medicines (avanafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil) \n \n• Do not take Kaletra if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil. \n• You must not take Kaletra with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high \n\nblood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Kaletra section above). \n• If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and Kaletra together, you may be at risk of side effects such as \n\nlow blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours.  \nIf an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid \npermanent damage to your penis.  Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. \n\n \nContraceptives \n \n• If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent \n\npregnancy, you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as \nKaletra may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. \n\n• Kaletra does not reduce the risk of passing HIV to others.  Appropriate precautions (e.g. use of a \ncondom) should be taken to prevent passing on the disease through sexual contact. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you \n\nmay be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.   \n• Breast-feeding mothers should not take Kaletra unless specifically directed by the doctor.   \n• It is recommended that HIV-infected women do not breast-feed their infants because there is a \n\npossibility that the baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk. \n \nDriving or using machines \n \nKaletra has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or operate \nmachines.  Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) \nthat impact your ability to do so safely.  Instead, contact your doctor. \n \n \n3. How to take Kaletra \n \n\nIt is important that Kaletra tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n \n\n\n\n 166 \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure how you should take your medicine. \n \nHow much Kaletra should be taken and when? \n \nUse in adults \n \n• The usual adult dose is 400 mg/100 mg twice a day i.e. every 12 hours, in combination with \n\nother anti-HIV medicines.  Adult patients who have not previously taken other antiviral \nmedicines can also take Kaletra tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose.  Your doctor will \nadvise on the number of tablets to be taken.  Adult patients who have previously taken other \nantiviral medicines can take Kaletra tablets once daily as an 800 mg/200 mg dose if their doctor \ndecides it is appropriate.   \n\n• Kaletra must not be taken once daily with efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, phenobarbital \nand phenytoin. \n\n• Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nUse in children of 2 years of age and above \n \n• For children, your doctor will decide the right dose (number of tablets) based on the child’s \n\nheight and weight.   \n• Kaletra tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \nKaletra is also supplied as 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets.  Kaletra oral solution is available for \npatients who cannot take tablets. \n \nIf you or your child take more Kaletra than you should \n \n• If you realise you have taken more Kaletra than you were supposed to, contact your doctor right \n\naway.   \n• If you cannot contact your doctor, go to the hospital. \n \nIf you or your child forget to take Kaletra \n \nIf you are taking Kaletra twice a day \n− If you notice you miss a dose within 6 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed dose \n\nas soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as prescribed \nby your doctor. \n\n \n− If you notice you miss a dose by more than 6 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Take the next dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you are taking Kaletra once a day \n− If you notice you miss a dose within 12 hours of your normal dosing time, take your missed \n\ndose as soon as possible, and then continue with your normal dose at the regular time as \nprescribed by your doctor. \n\n \n− If you notice you miss a dose by more than 12 hours after your normal dosing time, do not take \n\nthe missed dose.  Take the next dose as usual.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n\n \nIf you or your child stop taking Kaletra \n \n• Do not stop or change the daily dose of Kaletra without first consulting with your doctor. \n\n\n\n 167 \n\n• Kaletra should always be taken every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter how \nmuch better you feel.   \n\n• Taking Kaletra as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the development \nof resistance to the product. \n\n• If a side effect is preventing you from taking Kaletra as directed tell your doctor right away.  \n• Always keep enough Kaletra on hand so you don’t run out.  When you travel or need to stay in \n\nthe hospital make sure you will have enough Kaletra to last until you can get a new supply. \n• Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Kaletra can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  It may be \ndifficult to tell which side effects have been caused by Kaletra and which may occur due to other \nmedicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the HIV infection.   \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported by patients who took this medicine.
