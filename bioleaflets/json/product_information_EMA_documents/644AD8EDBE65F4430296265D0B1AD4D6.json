PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nPowder for solution for infusion \n\nWhite to off-white lyophilized powder \n\n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \nFor adult patients treated with a direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor (apixaban or rivaroxaban) when \nreversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nRestricted to hospital use only. \n\nPosology \nAndexanet alfa is administered as an intravenous bolus at a target rate of approximately 30 mg/min \nover 15 minutes (low dose) or 30 minutes (high dose), followed by administration of a continuous \ninfusion of 4 mg/min (low dose) or 8 mg/min (high dose) for 120 minutes (see table 1). \n\n \nTable 1:  Dosing regimens \n\n \n Initial \n\nintravenous \nbolus \n\nContinuous \nintravenous \n\ninfusion \n\nTotal number \nof 200 mg \n\nvials needed \n\nLow dose 400 mg at a target rate of \n30 mg/min \n\n4 mg/min for 120 minutes \n(480 mg) 5 \n\nHigh dose 800 mg at a target rate of \n30 mg/min \n\n8 mg/min for 120 minutes \n(960 mg) 9 \n\n\n\n3  \n\nReversal of apixaban \nThe recommended dose regimen of Ondexxya is based on the dose of apixaban the patient is taking at \nthe time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient’s last dose of apixaban \n(see table 2). \n\n \nTable 2:  Summary of dosing for reversal of apixaban \n\n \n \n \n \n\nFXa inhibitor \n\n \n \n \n\nLast dose \n\nTiming of last dose before \nOndexxya initiation \n\n< 8 hours or unknown ≥ 8 hours \n\n \n \n\nApixaban \n\n≤ 5 mg Low dose  \n \n\nLow dose > 5 mg/ \nUnknown \n\n \nHigh dose \n\n \n\nReversal of rivaroxaban \nThe recommended dose regimen of Ondexxya is based on the dose of rivaroxaban the patient is taking \nat the time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient’s last dose of \nrivaroxaban (see table 3). \n\n \nTable 3:  Summary of dosing for reversal of rivaroxaban \n\n \n \n \n \n\nFXa inhibitor \n\n \n \n \n\nLast dose \n\nTiming of last dose before \nOndexxya initiation \n\n< 8 hours or unknown ≥ 8 hours \n\n \n \n\nRivaroxaban \n\n≤ 10 mg Low dose  \n \n\nLow dose > 10 mg/ \nUnknown \n\n \nHigh dose \n\n \n\nRestarting antithrombotic therapy \nFollowing administration of Ondexxya and cessation of a major bleed, re-anticoagulation should be \nconsidered to prevent thrombotic events due to the patient’s underlying medical condition. \nAntithrombotic therapy can be re-initiated as soon as medically indicated following treatment if the \npatient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. Medical judgement should \nbalance the benefits of anticoagulation with the risks of re-bleeding (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients (aged 65 years and over):  No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n \nRenal impairment: The effect of renal impairment on andexanet alfa exposure levels has not been \nevaluated.  Based on the existing data on clearance, no dose adjustment is recommended. \n\n \nHepatic impairment: Based on the existing data on clearance of andexanet alfa, no dose adjustment is \nrecommended. The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n\n\n4  \n\nPaediatric population: The safety and efficacy of andexanet alfa in children and adolescents have not \nbeen established.  No data are available. \n\n \nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nIntravenous use \nAfter an appropriate number of vials of Ondexxya has been reconstituted, the reconstituted solution \n(10 mg/mL) is transferred to a suitable empty intravenous bag comprised of polyolefin (PO) or \npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) material without further dilution (see section 6.6) prior to administration by \nIV infusion using a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or equivalent low protein- \nbinding filter. \n\n \nOndexxya is administered as an IV bolus at a target rate of approximately 30 mg/min over 15 to \n30 minutes, followed by administration of a continuous infusion of 4 mg (low dose) or 8 mg (high \ndose) per minute for 120 minutes (see table 1). \n\n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any other ingredients listed in section 6.1. \n\nKnown allergic reaction to hamster proteins. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nLimitations of use \nClinical efficacy is based upon reversal of anti-FXa-activity in healthy volunteers dosed with apixaban \nor rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa is not suitable for pre-treatment of urgent surgery. Use for edoxaban- \nor enoxaparin-reversal is not recommended due to lack of data. Andexanet alfa will not reverse the \neffects of non-FXa inhibitors (see section 5.1). \n\n \nTreatment monitoring should be based mainly on clinical parameters indicative of appropriate \nresponse (i.e., achievement of haemostasis), lack of efficacy (i.e., re-bleeding), and adverse events \n(i.e., thromboembolic events). Treatment monitoring of andexanet alfa should not be based on anti-\nFXa-activity. Commercial anti-FXa-activity assays are unsuitable for measuring anti-FXa activity \nfollowing administration of andexanet alfa as these assays result in erroneously elevated anti-FXa \nactivity levels, thereby causing a substantial underestimation of the reversal activity of andexanet alfa. \n\n \nDosage recommendation is based upon data-modelling in healthy volunteers. Validation has not been \nsuccessful, yet. Data from bleeding patients are limited. Preliminary data suggest higher risk of \nthrombosis for patients receiving the higher dose of andexanet, previous lower dose of the anti-FXa \ninhibitor, and patients on rivaroxaban. \n\n \nIn ANNEXA-4, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) patients (GCS > 7 and haematoma volume < 60 mL) \nhave been included. Treatment of patients with more severe ICH with andexanet alfa has not been \nstudied. \n\n \nThrombotic events \nThrombotic events have been reported following treatment with andexanet alfa (see sections 4.8 and \n5.1).  Patients being treated with FXa inhibitor therapy have underlying disease states that predispose \nthem to thrombotic events. Reversing FXa inhibitor therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of \ntheir underlying disease. In addition, independent pro-thrombotic effect of andexanet alfa cannot be \nruled out.  Duration of this effect in bleeding patients is not known.  Laboratory parameters as anti- \nFXa activity, endogenous thrombotic potential (ETP), or markers of thrombosis might not be reliable \nfor guidance. To reduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be considered as soon as \nmedically appropriate after completion of treatment. \n\n\n\n5  \n\nIn healthy volunteers, dose-dependent increases in coagulation markers F1+2, TAT, and D-dimer after \nadministration of andexanet alfa were observed, but no thromboembolic events were reported. These \nmarkers were not measured in patients enrolled in the ANNEXA-4 study, but thromboembolic events \nhave been observed (see section 5.1). Monitoring for signs and symptoms of thrombosis is, therefore, \nstrongly recommended. \n\n \nUse of andexanet alfa in conjunction with other supportive measures \nAndexanet alfa can be used in conjunction with standard haemostatic supportive measures, which \nshould be considered as medically appropriate. \n\n \nThe safety of andexanet alfa has not been evaluated in patients who received prothrombin complex \nconcentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, or whole blood within seven days prior to the bleeding event, \nas they were excluded from clinical trials.  Pro-coagulant factor treatments (e.g., 3- or 4-factor \nprothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)/activated PCC, recombinant factor VIIa, fresh frozen \nplasma) and whole blood should be avoided unless absolutely required, due to lack of data in \ncombination with these treatments. \n\n \nInfusion-related reactions \nIn case of mild or moderate infusion reactions, careful observation may be sufficient.  For moderate \nsymptoms, consideration may be given to a brief interruption or slowing of the infusion with \nresumption of the infusion after symptoms subside. Diphenhydramine may be administered. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nNo interaction studies with andexanet alfa have been performed. \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of andexanet alfa in pregnant women.  Animal studies are insufficient \nwith respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Andexanet alfa is not recommended during \npregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether andexanet alfa is excreted in human milk.  A risk to newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded.  Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with andexanet alfa. \n\n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of andexanet alfa on human fertility. \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nAndexanet alfa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety has been evaluated in clinical trials including 247 healthy subjects administered an FXa \ninhibitor, as well as in 352 patients in a  Phase IIIb/IV trial (ANNEXA-4), who had acute major \nbleeding and were under treatment with an FXa inhibitor (mostly apixaban and rivaroxaban). \n\n \nIn the clinical trials in healthy subjects administered an FXa inhibitor and then receiving andexanet \nalfa, no serious or severe adverse reactions were reported. The most frequently observed adverse \nreactions were mild or moderate infusion-related reactions (see table 4) comprising symptoms such as \nflushing, feeling hot, cough, dysgeusia, and dyspnoea occurring within a few minutes to a few hours of \n\n\n\n6  \n\nthe infusion. Among the healthy subjects studied, women experienced more adverse reactions (mainly \ninfusion-related reactions) than men. \n\n \nIn the healthy subject trials, elevations > 2 x ULN in D-dimer and prothrombin fragments F1+2 were \nfrequently observed. These elevations were maintained between several hours to a few days following \nadministration, but no thrombotic events were reported.  Clinical relevance in the target population \n(patients with uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding who are anticoagulated due to high to very high \nrisk of thrombosis) is unknown. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 4 provides the list of adverse reactions from clinical studies of healthy subjects treated with \nandexanet alfa. The second column provides the list of adverse reactions from the interim results of \nthe Phase IIIb/IV ANNEXA-4 study, including 352 patients with acute major bleeding treated with \nandexanet alfa. The adverse reactions are classified by system organ class (SOC) and frequency, \nusing the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); or not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). \n\n \nTable 4:  List of adverse reactions in healthy subjects and bleeding patients \n\n \n\nSystem organ class/ \nPreferred term \n\nFrequency in \nhealthy \n\nvolunteers \n\nFrequency in \nbleeding \npatients \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nUrticaria common  \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCerebral infarction  uncommon \n\nCerebrovascular accident  uncommon \n\nDizziness postural common  \n\nHeadache common  \n\nIschaemic stroke  common \n\nTransient ischaemic attack  uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nAcute myocardial infarction  uncommon \n\nCardiac arrest  uncommon \n\nMyocardial infarction  uncommon \n\nPalpitations common  \n\nVascular disorders \n\nDeep vein thrombosis  uncommon \n\nIliac artery occlusion  uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nCough common  \n\nDyspnoea common  \n\nPulmonary embolism  uncommon \n\n\n\n7  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class/ \nPreferred term \n\nFrequency in \nhealthy \n\nvolunteers \n\nFrequency in \nbleeding \npatients \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nAbdominal discomfort common  \n\nAbdominal pain common  \n\nDry mouth common  \n\nDysgeusia common  \n\nNausea common  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nPruritus common  \n\nPruritus generalised common  \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain common  \n\nMuscle spasms common  \n\nGeneral disorders and administrative site conditions \n\nFlushing very common  \n\nFeeling hot very common  \n\nChest discomfort common  \n\nHyperhidrosis common  \n\nPeripheral coldness common  \n\nPyrexia  common \n\nInvestigations \nTransient elevations of D-dimer and F1+2 fragments very common  \n\n \n \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nBased on data from 352 patients from the Phase IIIb/IV ANNEXA-4 study treated with an FXa \ninhibitor and experiencing an acute major bleeding episode, one patient experienced a serious or severe \ninfusion-related reaction. Thirty-six of 352 patients with complete 30-day safety follow up (10.3%) \nhad thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction (MI              \n), and stroke. Ten of 36 (27.8%) patients had restarted antithrombotic therapy at the time of the event, \nand all 36 patients had been anticoagulated for a prior history of VTE and/or atrial fibrillation at       \nthe time of receiving andexanet alfa (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important, as it \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nThere is no clinical experience with overdose of andexanet alfa. No dose-limiting toxicities have been \nobserved during clinical trials. \n\n\n\n8  \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group:  All other therapeutic products, antidotes.  ATC code: V03AB38 \nMechanism of action \nAndexanet alfa is a recombinant form of human FXa protein that has been modified to lack FXa \nenzymatic activity. The active site serine was substituted with alanine, rendering the molecule unable \nto cleave and activate prothrombin, and the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain was removed \nto eliminate the ability of the protein to assemble into the prothrombinase complex, thus removing any \nanti-coagulant effects. \n\n \nAndexanet alfa is a specific reversal agent for FXa inhibitors. The predominant mechanism of action \nis the binding and sequestration of the FXa inhibitor, although there may be a minor contribution from \nthe inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity through binding to TFPI.  The \ninteraction between andexanet alfa and TFPI has not been fully characterized.  Andexanet alfa binds \ndirect FXa inhibitors with high affinity, making them unavailable to exert their anticoagulant effects. \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe effects of andexanet alfa can be measured through pharmacodynamic markers, including free \nfraction of available FXa inhibitor as well as through restoration of thrombin generation. \n\n \nCommercial anti-FXa-activity assays are unsuitable for measuring anti-FXa activity following \nadministration of andexanet alfa. Due to the reversible binding of andexanet alfa to the FXa inhibitor, \nthe high sample dilution currently used in these assays leads to dissociation of the inhibitor from \nandexanet alfa, resulting in detection of erroneously elevated anti-FXa activity levels, thereby causing \na substantial underestimation of the reversal activity of andexanet alfa. \n\n \nIn prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies in healthy subjects, the dose and \ndose regimen of andexanet alfa required to reverse anti-FXa activity and restore thrombin generation \nfor FXa inhibitors (apixaban or rivaroxaban) were determined with modified assays that are not \ncommercially available. \n\n \nThe maximal reversal of anti-FXa activity was achieved within two minutes of completing the bolus \nadministration. Administration of andexanet alfa as a bolus followed by continuous infusion resulted \nin a sustained decrease in anti-FXa activity. The anti-FXa activity returned to the placebo levels and \nabove approximately two hours after the end of a bolus or infusion dependent on dosage. \n\n \nWhen andexanet alfa was administered as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion, the maximum \ndecrease in unbound FXa inhibitors was rapid (within two minutes of the end of the bolus) and was \nsustained over the course of the infusion then gradually increased over time, reaching a maximum at \napproximately two hours following the end of infusion. \n\n \nRestoration of thrombin generation following administration was dose- and dose-regimen-dependent \nand did not correlate with anti-FXa-activity beyond approximately four hours (see below, “restoration \nof thrombin generation”). \n\n \nPlasma TFPI activity has been shown to be inhibited for 10 to 20 hours following andexanet alfa \nadministration. The clinical relevance of this interaction in terms of maintenance of thrombin \ngeneration and the potential for a prothrombotic effect has not been fully elucidated. \n\n \nPK/PD modelling \nBolus strengths of andexanet alfa being necessary to achieve mean unbound apixaban (400 mg bolus) \nand unbound rivaroxaban concentrations (800 mg bolus) below the anticipated respective threshold for \nno anticoagulant effect were twice as high for rivaroxaban (20 mg QD) compared to apixaban (5 mg \nBID), due to the differential PK characteristics and dose levels of respective FXa inhibitor. \n \n\n\n\n9  \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa have been evaluated in the following:  1) randomized, \nplacebo-controlled, Phase II dose-ranging trials with healthy volunteers administered FXa inhibitors to \nestablish doses required for reversal; 2) two Phase III studies, one with apixaban and the other with \nrivaroxaban, to confirm the efficacy of the high and low dose regimens; and 3) a global, multicentre, \nprospectively defined, open-label Phase IIIb/IV study (ANNEXA-4) in patients with an acute major \nbleeding episode requiring urgent reversal of FXa anticoagulation. \n\n \nReversal of anticoagulation in healthy subjects aged 50-75 (Studies 14-503 and 14-504) \nIn a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, healthy subjects with a median age of \n56.5 years on apixaban 5 mg twice daily received andexanet alfa (n=24) administered as a 400 mg IV \nbolus immediately followed by a 4 mg per minute IV infusion for 120 minutes (480 mg) or placebo \n(n=8). \n\n \nIn a similar study, subjects with a median age of 57 years on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily received \nandexanet alfa (n=26) administered as an 800 mg IV bolus immediately followed by an 8 mg per \nminute IV infusion for 120 minutes (960 mg) or placebo (n=13). \n\n \nReduction in anti-FXa activity \nThe primary endpoint for both Study 14-503 (apixaban) and Study 14-504 (rivaroxaban) was the \npercent change in anti-FXa activity from baseline to post-infusion nadir. \n\n \nAmong the apixaban-treated subjects in Study 14-503, the percent change in anti-FXa activity was \n-92.34% (± 2.809%) for the andexanet alfa group and -32.70% (± 5.578%) for the placebo group \n(p < 0.0001), the latter reflecting the intrinsic clearance of the anticoagulant. \n\n \nAmong the rivaroxaban-treated subjects in Study 14-504, the percent change in anti-FXa activity \nwas -96.72% (± 1.838%) for the andexanet alfa group and -44.75% (± 11.749%) for the placebo group \n(p < 0.0001), the latter reflecting the intrinsic clearance of the anticoagulant. \n\n \nThe time courses of anti-FXa activity before and after andexanet alfa administration are shown in \nFigure 1.  Reduction in anti-FXa activity correlates with restoration of thrombin generation. The anti- \nFXa activity thresholds for normalization of thrombin generation (defined by mean ETP and standard \ndeviations) were estimated to be 44.2 ng/mL (within one standard deviation of normal ETP) based on \npooled data from Studies 14-503 and 14-504, as indicated in the figure. \n\n \nFigure 1: Change in anti-FXa activity (ng/mL) in healthy subjects anticoagulated with \n\napixaban (A) and rivaroxaban (B) \n \n\n \n \n\n(A) \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(B) \n \n \n\nRestoration of thrombin generation \nIn both, Study 14-503 and Study 14-504, treatment with andexanet alfa also resulted in a statistically \nsignificant increase in thrombin generation in healthy subjects anticoagulated with apixaban or \nrivaroxaban versus placebo (p < 0.0001). Restoration of thrombin generation to within normal ranges \n(defined as one standard deviation from baseline levels) within two minutes and maintained for \n20 hours was achieved with bolus only and bolus plus infusion for low-dose andexanet alfa in subjects \non apixaban. For subjects on rivaroxaban, high-dose andexanet alfa (bolus plus infusion) resulted in \nincreased thrombin generation above two standard deviations. No clinical evaluation for apixaban- \ntreated subjects with high-dose andexanet alfa and no evaluation for rivaroxaban-treated subjects with \nlow-dose andexanet alfa was performed in these studies. \n\n \nChange from baseline in free FXa inhibitor concentration at nadir \nThe mean unbound concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban were < 3.5 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL, \nrespectively, after bolus andexanet alfa administration and were maintained throughout the continuous \ninfusion. These levels of unbound FXa inhibitor provide little or no anticoagulant effect. \n\n \nReversal of FXa inhibitor anticoagulation in patients with acute major bleeding \nIn Study 14-505 (ANNEXA-4), a Phase IIIb/IV multinational, prospective, single-arm, open-label \nstudy, Ondexxya was administered to 352 patients on FXa inhibitors who presented with acute major \nbleeding.  The two co-primary endpoints are:  a) percent change in anti-FXa activity from baseline to \nthe nadir between five minutes after the end of the bolus until the end of the infusion, and; b) rate of \ngood or excellent (compared to poor or none) haemostatic efficacy within 12 hours after infusion, as \nrated by an independent endpoint adjudication committee . \n\n \nIn an updated interim analysis, data of 352 patients were evaluated. \n\n \nApproximately half of the patients were male, and the mean age was 77.4 years. Most patients had \npreviously received either apixaban (194/352; 55.1%) or rivaroxaban (128/352; 36.4%), and \nexperienced either an ICH (230/352; 65.3%) or a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (94/352; 26.7%).  \n297/352 Patients (84.4%) received the low-dose regimen of andexanet, while 55 patients (15.6%) \nreceived the high-dose regimen. \n\n \nOf 352 enrolled patients, 249 (70.7%) were included in the efficacy-analysis. For these patients, \nmedian anti-FXa activity at baseline was 149.7 ng/mL for patients taking apixaban, and 211.8 ng/mL \nfor patients taking rivaroxaban. Median change from baseline to nadir in anti-FXa activity was \n -93.4% (95% CI -94.3%, -92.4%) for apixaban, and -92.5% (95% CI -94.2%, -90.3%) for \nrivaroxaban. \nHaemostatic efficacy was good or excellent in 81.9% of 249 patients. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe updated interim analysis demonstrated that the change in anti-FXa activity (surrogate) was not \npredictive for achievement of hemostatic efficacy in the overall patient population. \n\n \n\nDeaths \nIn the ANNEXA-4 study, of the patients in the safety population completing 30-day follow up \n(N=351), 54 patients (15.4%) died. The 30-day mortality rates were 16.2% (37/229) in patients \npresenting with ICH, 12.8% (12/94) with GI bleeding, and 17.9% (5/28) with other types of bleeding. \nThe 30-day mortality rates were 20.1% (44/219) in patients aged > 75 years old and 7.6% (10/132) in \npatients aged ≤ 75 years.  According to region, death rates were 22.1% (31/140) in patients recruited in \nthe European Union and 10.9% (23/211) in patients recruited in North America. Compared with \npatients recruited in North America, EU patients were significantly older (79.0 years vs. 76.3 years), \nmore frequently had ICH as index event (72.9% vs. 59.0%) and more ICHs were intraparenchymal \n(54.9% vs. 34.4%).   Cardiovascular causes of death (n=27) included: haemorrhagic stroke (n=6), \nischaemic stroke (n=5), sudden cardiac death (including unwitnessed) (n=5), cardiomechanical/pump \nfailure (n=4), myocardial infarction (n=2), bleeding other than haemorrhagic stroke (n=1), and other \ncardiovascular causes (n=4). Non-cardiovascular deaths (n=27) included: respiratory failure (n=5), \ninfection/sepsis (n=5), accident/trauma (n=2), cancer (n=1), and other/non-vascular cause (n=14). \n\n \nThromboembolic events \nIn the ANNEXA-4 study, 36 (10.3%) patients experienced a total of 42 thromboembolic events: \ncerebrovascular accident (CVA) (15/42; 35.7%), deep venous thrombosis (13/42; 33.1%), acute \nmyocardial infarction (8/42; 19.0%), pulmonary embolism (5/42; 11.9%), and transient ischaemic \nattack (1/42; 2.4%). The median time to event was nine days. A total of 33.3% of patients with \nthromboembolic events (12/36) experienced the thromboembolic event during the first three days.  Of \nthe 209 patients who were re-anticoagulated prior to a thrombotic event, 10 (4.8%) patients \nexperienced a thromboembolic event. At the time of the event 10/36 (27.8%) patients were on \nantithrombotic therapy. The occurrence of thromboembolic events was generally comparable between \npatients > 75 years (11.0%; 24/219) and those ≤ 75 years of age (9.1%; 12/132). \n\n \nNo thromboembolic events were observed in 223 healthy volunteers who received FXa inhibitors and \nwere treated with andexanet alfa.  Dose-dependent increases in coagulation markers F1+2, TAT, and \nD-dimers after administration of andexanet alfa were observed, but these markers were not measured \nin patients enrolled in the ANNEXA-4 study, and their relevance in bleeding patients is not known. \n\n \nImmunogenicity \n345 andexanet alfa-treated healthy subjects were tested for antibodies cross reacting with andexanet \nalfa and antibodies to factor X and FXa. Treatment-emergent, non-neutralizing antibodies to \nandexanet alfa were detected in approximately 10% (35/345). These antibodies were generally low \ntitre, and no clinical consequences were observed. No neutralising antibodies or antibodies to factor X \nor FXa were detected. To date, the occurrence of positive, non-neutralizing antibodies to andexanet \nalfa following treatment in patients in the ANNEXA-4 study (8.5% or 20/236 patients) has been \nsimilar to that observed in healthy subjects. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nandexanet alfa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment and prevention of FXa \ninhibitor-associated haemorrhages (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \nConditional approval \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme.  This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \n\n\n\n12  \n\nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year, and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nPhase II studies of andexanet alfa in the presence of direct FXa inhibitors demonstrated the same dose \nproportional pharmacokinetics over the intended therapeutic dose range evaluated for both Cmax and \narea under the curve (AUC) with an effective half-life of approximately one hour. The volume of \ndistribution at steady state (Vdss) and volume of distribution (Vd) at sub-therapeutic levels decreased \nwith dose, consistent with the saturation of a high-affinity compartment, likely to reflect binding to \nendothelial cell bound TFPI, the only endogenous molecule known to bind andexanet alfa. FXa \ninhibitors did not affect andexanet alfa pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels. \n\n \nAll PK studies were conducted using a former drug substance generation. PK comparability with \nandexanet alfa in Ondexxya (Generation 2) has not yet been proven. \n\n \n \n\nDistribution \nThe Vd for andexanet alfa is 5.3 ± 2.6 L, approximately equivalent to the blood volume. \n\n \nElimination \nClearance (L/hr) for andexanet alfa is 4.4 ± 1.2 L/hr with low renal elimination. The elimination half- \nlife ranges from four to seven hours.  Based on what is known about the disposition kinetics of native \nFXa, andexanet alfa is likely rapidly broken down in plasma by endogenous proteases, consistent with \nits relatively short effective half-life (one hour). \n\n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n\n \n\nElderly population \nIn a study comparing andexanet alfa pharmacokinetics in elderly (65-69 years) and younger \n(26-42 years) healthy subjects who had received apixaban, the pharmacokinetics of andexanet alfa in \nthe elderly subjects were not statistically different than those in the younger subjects. \n\n \nRenal impairment \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of andexanet alfa in renally \nimpaired patients.  Based on the available PK data, andexanet alfa has little to no renal clearance, and \nthus would not require dose adjustment for patients with renal impairment. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of andexanet alfa in patients with \nhepatic impairment. Biliary and/or faeces elimination of protein therapeutics is not a known route of \nprotein elimination. Therefore, dose adjustment is not considered needed for patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n\n \nGender \nBased on population pharmacokinetics analysis, gender does not have a clinically meaningful effect on \nthe pharmacokinetics of andexanet alfa. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of andexanet alfa has not been studied in paediatric patients. \n\n \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies up to two weeks in rats and monkeys. \n\n\n\n13  \n\nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of andexanet alfa have not been \nperformed.  Based on its mechanism of action and on the characteristics of proteins, no carcinogenic \nor genotoxic effects are anticipated. \n\n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental studies have not been conducted with andexanet alfa. \n\n \n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nTris base \nTris hydrochloride \nL-arginine hydrochloride \nSucrose \nMannitol \nPolysorbate 80 \n\n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n\n \n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \nVial (unopened) \nThree years stored at 2°C to 8°C. \n\n \nReconstituted medicinal product \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 16 hours at 2°C to 8°C in the \nprimary packaging vial.  If needed, the reconstituted solution once transferred into the IV bag can be \nstored for an additional eight hours at room temperature.  From a microbiological point of view, once \nreconstituted, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times \nand conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\nPowder in a 20 mL vial (Type I glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n\nPack size of four vials. \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n\nReconstitution \n \n\nThe following are needed before starting reconstitution: \n• Calculated number of vials (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n14  \n\n• Same number of 20 mL (or larger) solvent syringes equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) \nneedle. \n\n• Alcohol swabs. \n• Large (60 mL or larger) sterile syringe. If a syringe driver is used for administration, multiple \n\nsyringes should be used to contain the final volume of reconstituted product. \n• Intravenous PO or PVC bag (150 mL or larger) to contain the final volume of reconstituted \n\nproduct (if administration is performed with an IV bag). \n• Water for injections \n\n \nAndexanet alfa does not need to be brought to room temperature before reconstitution or \nadministration to the patient. Aseptic technique during the reconstitution procedure should be used. \n\n \nEach vial is reconstituted according to the following instructions: \n\n \n1. Remove the flip-top from each vial. \n2. Wipe the rubber stopper of each vial with an alcohol swab. \n3. Using a 20 mL (or larger) syringe and a 20 gauge (or larger) needle, withdraw 20 mL of water \n\nfor injections. \n4. Insert the syringe needle through the centre of the rubber stopper. \n5. Push the plunger down to slowly inject the 20 mL of water for injections into the vial, \n\ndirecting the stream toward the inside wall of the vial to minimise foaming. \n6. Gently swirl each vial, until all of the powder is completely dissolved. DO NOT SHAKE the \n\nvials, as this can lead to foaming. The dissolution time for each vial is approximately three to \nfive minutes. \n\n7. The reconstituted solution should be inspected for particulate matter and/or discolouration \nprior to administration.  Do not use if opaque particles or discolouration are present. \n\n8. For the most efficient reconstitution of the needed dose, and to minimise errors, inject each \nvial needed with 20 mL of water for injections before proceeding to the next step. \n\n9. Use within eight hours after reconstitution when stored at room temperature. \n\nAdministration using a syringe pump \n\n1. Once all required vials are reconstituted, the reconstituted solution is withdrawn from each \nvial, using the large volume (60 mL or larger) syringe equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) \nneedle. \n\n2. The bolus and infusion are prepared in separate large volume syringes. \n3. Due to the additional volume, the high dose bolus and infusion have to be further separated \n\ninto additional syringes (two syringes apiece for bolus and infusion). \n4. To prevent the inadvertent transfer of air, be careful to hold the syringe needle up, and do not \n\nset the syringe down between multiple withdrawals from vials. \n5. Attach ancillary equipment (i.e., extension tubing, air filters, syringe driver) in preparation for \n\nadministration. \n6. Administer the reconstituted solution at the appropriate rate. \n7. Discard all used syringes, needles, and vials, including any unused portion of reconstituted \n\nsolution. \n \n\nAdministration using an intravenous bag \n \n\n1. Once all required vials are reconstituted, withdraw the reconstituted solution from each vial, \nusing the large volume (60 mL or larger) syringe equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) needle. \n\n2. Transfer the reconstituted solution from the syringe into an appropriate IV bag. \n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 as necessary to transfer the complete volume of the bolus and the \n\ninfusion into an IV bag. \n4. While it is permissible to combine the bolus and infusion into a single IV bag, it is \n\nrecommended that the bolus and infusion be split into two separate bags to ensure the correct \nadministration rate. \n\n\n\n15  \n\n5. Attach ancillary equipment (i.e., extension tubing, air filters, IV pump) in preparation for \nadministration. \n\n6. Administer the reconstituted solution at the appropriate rate. \n \n\nDisposal \nAll used syringes, needles, and vials, including any unused portion of reconstituted solution, should be \ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n \n\n7.

Please note \nthis medicine is mainly used in emergency situations, and the doctor will have decided that you \nneeded it. \n\n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Ondexxya is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Ondexxya \n3. How Ondexxya is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Ondexxya is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Ondexxya is and what it is used for \n \n\nOndexxya contains the active ingredient andexanet alfa.  It reverses the effects of certain \nanticoagulants called factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban or rivaroxaban).  Factor Xa inhibitors are given to \nprevent clots in your blood vessels. Your doctor may decide to give you Ondexxya to rapidly reverse \nthe effects of the anticoagulant in case of a life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding situation. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Ondexxya \n\nDo not use Ondexxya: \n• if you are allergic to andexanet alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you are allergic to hamster proteins \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n \nReversing the effect of a factor Xa inhibitor with Ondexxya may increase the risk of blood clots. \nAfter treatment with Ondexxya, your doctor will decide when to restart anticoagulant therapy. \n\n \nIf you suffer side effects when you are being given Ondexxya by infusion (drip), your doctor may \ndecide to slow down or pause your treatment.  Your doctor may give you an antihistamine medicine to \nhelp with any side effects (see section 4). \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n\n \nThere is no information on the use of Ondexxya in children and adolescents. \n\n\n\n26  \n\nOther medicines and Ondexxya \n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take, any other medicines. \n \n\nThis medicine has been designed to reverse the effects of factor Xa inhibitor medicines only.  It is \nunlikely that Ondexxya will influence the effect of other medicines or that other medicines will \ninfluence Ondexxya. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to \nhave a baby. \n\n \nOndexxya is not recommended during pregnancy or if you have the potential to become pregnant and \nare not using birth control. \n\n \nDo not breast-feed your child while you are taking this medicine. It is unknown if andexanet alfa is \nexcreted in human milk. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n\n \nThis medicine is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n \n\n3. How Ondexxya is used \n \n\nThis medicine is for hospital use only. \n \n\nYour doctor or nurse will give you this medicine by injection or infusion into a vein. \n \n\nYour doctor or nurse will work out the dose of this medicine that you need. This is based on the \nspecific anticoagulant medicine you take as well as on the dose and the time since your last dose of \nanticoagulant medicine. \n\n \nAfter you have received Ondexxya, your doctor will decide when to restart your anticoagulant \ntreatment. \n\n \nDetailed instructions for your doctor or nurse on how to give Ondexxya are given at the end of this \npackage leaflet (see ‘Handling instructions’). \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\nThe most common side effects associated with Ondexxya in clinical trials of healthy people were \ninfusion–related reactions with usually mild symptoms such as flushing or feeling hot (very common \nside effects which may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Headache, cough, or shortness of breath \n(common side effects which may affect up to 1 in 10 people) happened within a few minutes to a few \nhours of the infusion. In clinical trials of patients with life-threatening bleeding, fever and stroke may \naffect up to 1 in 10 people; transient ischaemic attack (TIA), heart attack, and blood clots in the legs or \nlungs may affect up to 1 in 100 people (uncommon side effects). \n\n\n\n27  \n\nList of possible side effects \n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• flushing or feeling hot \n• effects on blood clotting markers: some markers which affect blood clotting were increased for \n\na little while and then returned to normal. There were no blood clots in these healthy people. \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• hives \n• dizziness \n• rapid or irregular heartbeat \n• stomach pain or discomfort \n• dry mouth \n• disturbance of taste \n• nausea (feeling sick) \n• chest discomfort \n• feeling cold \n• excessive sweating \n• itching \n• back pain \n• muscle spasms \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How Ondexxya is stored \n \n\nThis medicine will be stored in the hospital, and these instructions are intended for hospital staff only. \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial and the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nOnce reconstituted, Ondexxya is for immediate use. \n \n\n6.

This means that there is more evidence to come \nabout this medicine. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and \nthis leaflet will be updated as necessary. \n\n \nOther sources of information \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only. \n\n \n\nAndexanet alfa reverses the anticoagulant effect of direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor products (apixaban, \nrivaroxaban) only.  Reversal of the effects of other FXa inhibitors (e.g., fondaparinux, unfractionated \nheparin) with andexanet alfa has not been studied in humans.  It will not reverse the effects of non-FXa \ninhibitors. \n\n \nDosage and administration \n\n \nAndexanet alfa is administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus at a target rate of approximately \n30 mg/min over 15 (low dose) or 30 minutes (high dose), immediately followed by administration of a \ncontinuous infusion of 4 mg (low dose) or 8 mg (high dose) per minute for 120 minutes (see table 1). \n\n \nTable 1:  Dosing regimens \n\n \n Initial \n\nintravenous \nbolus \n\nContinuous \nintravenous \n\ninfusion \n\nTotal number \nof 200 mg \n\nvials needed \n\nLow dose 400 mg at a target rate of \n30 mg/min \n\n4 mg/min for 120 minutes \n(480 mg) 5 \n\nHigh dose 800 mg at a target rate of \n30 mg/min \n\n8 mg/min for 120 minutes \n(960 mg) 9 \n\n\n\n29  \n\nDosage recommendations have been defined from the effects of andexanet alfa in healthy volunteers \nadministered a direct FXa inhibitor and from the ability to reverse the levels of anti-FXa activity. The \nposology was confirmed in a study in patients with acute major bleeding. \n\n \nReversal of apixaban \nThe recommended dose regimen of andexanet alfa is based on the dose of apixaban the patient is \ntaking at the time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient’s last dose of \napixaban (see table 2). \n\n \nTable 2:  Summary of dosing for reversal of apixaban \n\n \n \n\nFXa \ninhibitor \n\n \nFXa inhibitor \n\nlast dose \n\nTiming of FXa inhibitor last dose before \nandexanet alfa initiation \n\n< 8 hours or unknown ≥ 8 hours \n\n \n \n\nApixaban \n\n≤ 5 mg Low dose  \n \n\nLow dose > 5 mg/ \nUnknown \n\n \nHigh dose \n\n \n\nReversal of rivaroxaban \nThe recommended dose regimen of andexanet alfa is based on the dose of rivaroxaban the patient is \ntaking at the time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient’s last dose of \nrivaroxaban (see table 3). \n\n \nTable 3:  Summary of dosing for reversal of rivaroxaban \n\n \n \n\nFXa \ninhibitor \n\n \nFXa inhibitor \n\nlast dose \n\nTiming of FXa inhibitor last dose before \nandexanet alfa initiation \n\n< 8 hours or unknown ≥ 8 hours \n\n \n \n\nRivaroxaban \n\n≤ 10 mg Low dose  \n \n\nLow dose > 10 mg/ \nUnknown \n\n \nHigh dose \n\n \n\nPatients being treated with FXa inhibitor therapy have underlying disease states that predispose them \nto thromboembolic events. Reversing FXa inhibitor therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of \ntheir underlying disease. To reduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be \nconsidered as soon as medically appropriate. \n\n \nHandling instructions \nAndexanet alfa is to be reconstituted and the 10 mg/mL solution then transferred to a suitable IV bag \ncomprised of polyolefin (PO) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material without further dilution prior to \nadministration by IV infusion using a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or equivalent \nlow protein-binding filter. \n\n \nFor reconstituted solutions, chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for at least \neight hours at 25°C. From a microbiological point of view, once opened, the product should be used \nimmediately.  If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user. \n\n\n\n30  \n\nReconstitution \n \n\nBefore starting reconstitution, you will need the following: \n• Calculated number of vials as given in table 1. \n• Same number of 20 mL (or larger) solvent syringes equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) \n\nneedle. \n• Alcohol swabs. \n• Large (60 mL or larger) sterile syringe.  If administration is done with a syringe driver, \n\nmultiple syringes should be used to contain the final volume of reconstituted product. \n• IV PO or PVC bag (150 mL or larger) to contain the final volume of reconstituted product (if \n\nadministration is done with an IV bag). \n• Water for injection \n\n \nAndexanet alfa does not need to be brought to room temperature before reconstitution or \nadministration to the patient.  Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution procedure. \n\n \nReconstitute each vial according to the following instructions: \n\n1. Remove the flip-top from each vial. \n2. Wipe the rubber stopper of each vial with an alcohol swab. \n3. Using a 20 mL (or larger) syringe and a 20 gauge (or larger) needle, withdraw 20 mL of water \n\nfor injection. \n4. Insert the syringe needle through the centre of the rubber stopper. \n5. Push the plunger down to slowly inject the 20 mL of water for injections into the vial, \n\ndirecting the stream toward the inside wall of the vial to minimise foaming. \n6. Gently swirl each vial until all of the powder is completely dissolved.  DO NOT SHAKE the \n\nvials, as this can lead to foaming. The dissolution time for each vial is approximately three to \nfive minutes. \n\n7. The reconstituted solution should be inspected for particulate matter and/or discolouration \nprior to administration.  Do not use if opaque particles or discolouration are present. \n\n8. For the most efficient reconstitution of the needed dose, and to minimise errors, inject each \nvial needed with 20 mL of water for injections before proceeding to the next step. \n\n9. Use andexanet alfa within eight hours after reconstitution when stored at room temperature. \n \n\nAdministration using a syringe pump \n1. Once all required vials are reconstituted, withdraw the reconstituted solution from each vial, \n\nusing the large volume (60 mL or larger) syringe equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) needle. \n2. Prepare the bolus and infusion in separate large volume syringes. \n3. Due to the additional volume, the high dose bolus and infusion will need to be further \n\nseparated into additional syringes (two syringes apiece for bolus and infusion). \n4. To prevent the inadvertent transfer of air, be careful to hold the syringe needle up, and do not \n\nset the syringe down between multiple withdrawals from vials. \n5. Attach ancillary equipment (i.e., extension tubing, air filters, syringe driver) in preparation for \n\nadministration. \n6. Administer the reconstituted solution at the appropriate rate. \n7. Discard all used syringes, needles, and vials, including any unused portion of reconstituted \n\nsolution. \n \n\nAdministration using an intravenous bag \n1. Once all required vials are reconstituted, withdraw the reconstituted solution from each vial, \n\nusing the large volume (60 mL or larger) syringe equipped with a 20 gauge (or larger) needle. \n2. Transfer the reconstituted solution from the syringe into an appropriate IV bag. \n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 as necessary to transfer the complete volume of the bolus and the \n\ninfusion into an IV bag. \n4. While it is permissible to combine the bolus and infusion into a single IV bag, to ensure the \n\ncorrect administration rate, it is recommended that the bolus and infusion are split into two \nseparate bags. \n\n\n\n31  \n\n5. Attach ancillary equipment (i.e., extension tubing, air filters, IV pump) in preparation for \nadministration. \n\n6. Administer the reconstituted solution at the appropriate rate. \n \n\nDisposal \nAll used syringes, needles, and vials, including any unused portion of reconstituted solution, should be \ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\t1.
