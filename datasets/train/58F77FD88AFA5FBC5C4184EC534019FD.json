CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nPiqray is indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and \n\nmen, with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \n\n(HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease \n\nprogression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with Piqray should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\nPatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer should be selected for treatment \n\nwith Piqray based on the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in tumour or plasma specimens, using a \n\nvalidated test. If a mutation is not detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested if \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg alpelisib (2x 150 mg film-coated tablets) taken once daily on a \n\ncontinuous basis. Piqray should be taken immediately after food, at approximately the same time each \n\nday (see section 5.2). The maximum recommended daily dose of Piqray is 300 mg. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Piqray is missed, it can be taken immediately following food and within 9 hours after the \n\ntime it is usually administered. After more than 9 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. On \n\nthe next day, Piqray should be taken at the usual time. If the patient vomits after taking the Piqray \n\ndose, the patient should not take an additional dose on that day and should resume the usual dosing \n\nschedule the next day at the usual time. \n\n \n\nPiqray should be co-administered with fulvestrant. The recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg \n\nadministered intramuscularly on days 1, 15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the \n\nfull prescribing information of fulvestrant. \n\n \n\nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n\nDose modifications may be necessary to improve tolerability. \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\nManagement of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may require temporary dose \n\ninterruption, reduction, and/or discontinuation of Piqray. If dose reduction is required, the dose \n\nreduction guidelines for ADRs are listed in Table 1. A maximum of 2 dose reductions are \n\nrecommended, after which the patient should be permanently discontinued from treatment with Piqray. \n\nDose reduction should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose reduction guidelines for ADRs for Piqray1 \n \n\nPiqray dose level Dose and schedule Number and strength of tablets \n\nStarting dose 300 mg/day continuously 2x 150 mg tablets \n\nFirst dose reduction 250 mg/day continuously 1x 200 mg tablet and 1x 50 mg tablet \n\nSecond dose reduction 200 mg/day continuously 1x 200 mg tablet \n1 Only one dose reduction is permitted for pancreatitis. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nTables 2-5 summarise the recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of \n\nPiqray in the management of specific ADRs. The clinical judgement of the treating physician, \n\nincluding confirmation of laboratory values if deemed necessary, should guide the management plan \n\nof each patient based on the individual benefit/risk assessment for treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTable 2 Dose modification and management for hyperglycaemia1 \n\n \n\nFasting glucose values1 Recommendation \n\nDose reductions should only be based on fasting glucose (plasma/blood) values. \n\n Consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment \n\nof hyperglycaemia should always be considered and is recommended for \n\npatients who are pre-diabetic or those with fasting glucose (FG) \n\n>250 mg/dl or 13.9 mmol/l, body mass index (BMI) \u226530 or age \n\n\u226575 years. \n\nConsultation with a diabetologist or a healthcare professional \n\nexperienced in the treatment of hyperglycaemia should always take \n\nplace for patients with diabetes. \n\nAll patients should be instructed on lifestyle changes that may reduce \n\nhyperglycaemia (e.g. dietary restrictions and physical activity). \n\n>ULN-160 mg/dl or \n\n>ULN-8.9 mmol/l \n\nNo Piqray dose adjustment required. \n\nInitiate or intensify oral antidiabetic treatment2. \n\n>160-250 mg/dl or \n\n>8.9-13.9 mmol/l \n\nNo Piqray dose adjustment required. \n\nInitiate or further intensify oral antidiabetic treatment2. \n\nIf FG does not decrease to \u2264160 mg/dl or 8.9 mmol/l within 21 days \n\nwith appropriate oral antidiabetic treatment2,3, reduce Piqray dose by \n\n1 dose level and follow FG-value-specific recommendations. \n\n>250-500 mg/dl or \n\n>13.9-27.8 mmol/l \n\nInterrupt Piqray. \n\nInitiate or intensify oral antidiabetic treatment2 and consider additional \n\nantidiabetic medicinal products (such as insulin3) for 1-2 days until \n\nhyperglycaemia resolves. \n\nAdminister intravenous hydration and consider appropriate treatment \n\n(e.g. intervention for electrolyte / ketoacidosis / hyperosmolar \n\ndisturbances). \n\nIf FG decreases to \u2264160 mg/dl or 8.9 mmol/l within 3 to 5 days under \n\nappropriate antidiabetic treatment, resume Piqray at next lower dose \n\nlevel. \n\nIf FG does not decrease to \u2264160 mg/dl or 8.9 mmol/l within 3 to 5 days \n\nunder appropriate antidiabetic treatment, consultation with a healthcare \n\nprofessional with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycaemia is \n\nrecommended. \n\n\uf0b7 If FG does not decrease to \u2264160 mg/dl or 8.9 mmol/l within 21 days \n\nfollowing appropriate antidiabetic treatment2,3, permanently discontinue \n\nPiqray treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n>500 mg/dl or \n\n\u226527.8 mmol/l \n\nInterrupt Piqray. \n\nInitiate or intensify appropriate antidiabetic treatment2,3 (administer \n\nintravenous hydration and consider appropriate treatment [e.g. \n\nintervention for electrolyte / ketoacidosis / hyperosmolar disturbances]), \n\nre-check within 24 hours and as clinically indicated. \n\n\uf0b7 If FG decreases to \u2264500 mg/dl or \u226427.8 mmol/l, then follow \n\nFG-value-specific recommendations for <500 mg/dl. \n\nIf FG is confirmed at >500 mg/dl or \u226527.8 mmol/l after 24 hours, \n\npermanently discontinue Piqray treatment. \n1 Fasting glucose levels reflect hyperglycaemia grading according to CTCAE Version 4.03 \n\nCTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. \n2 Applicable antidiabetic medicinal products should be initiated and the respective prescribing \n\ninformation should be reviewed for dosing and dose titration recommendations, including local \n\ndiabetic treatment guidelines. Metformin was recommended in the phase III clinical study with the \n\nfollowing guidance: Metformin should be initiated at 500 mg once daily. Based on tolerability, the \n\nmetformin dose may be increased to 500 mg twice daily, followed by 500 mg with breakfast, and \n\n1000 mg with the evening meal, followed by further increase to 1000 mg twice daily if needed (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n3 As recommended in the phase III clinical study, insulin may be used for 1-2 days until hyperglycaemia \n\nresolves. However, this may not be necessary in the majority of cases of alpelisib-induced \n\nhyperglycaemia, given the short half-life of alpelisib and the expectation that glucose levels will \n\nnormalise following interruption of Piqray. \n\n \n\nBaseline diabetic and pre-diabetic status, baseline BMI \u226530 and baseline age \u226575 years have been \n\nfound to be risk factors for hyperglycaemia in patients treated with alpelisib. These risk factors were \n\npresent in 74.7% of patients with any grade of hyperglycaemia and in 86.2% of patients with grade 3 \n\nor 4 hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nRash \n\nOral antihistamine administration may be considered prophylactically, at the time of initiation of \n\ntreatment with Piqray. Additionally, antihistamines are recommended to manage symptoms of rash. \n\n \n\nTopical corticosteroid treatment should be initiated at the first signs of rash and oral corticosteroids \n\nshould be considered for moderate to severe rashes. Based on the severity of rash, Piqray may require \n\ndose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 3 (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTable 3 Dose modification and management for rash1 \n\n \n\nGrade Recommendation \n\nAll grades Consultation with a dermatologist should always be \n\nconsidered. \n\nGrade 1 \n\n(<10% body surface area [BSA] with \n\nactive skin toxicity) \n\nNo Piqray dose adjustment required. \n\nInitiate topical corticosteroid treatment. \n\nConsider adding oral antihistamine treatment to manage \n\nsymptoms. \n\nGrade 2 \n\n(10-30% BSA with active skin \n\ntoxicity) \n\nNo Piqray dose adjustment required. \n\nInitiate or intensify topical corticosteroid and oral \n\nantihistamine treatment. \n\nConsider low-dose oral corticosteroid treatment. \n\nGrade 3 (e.g. severe rash not \n\nresponsive to medical management) \n\n(>30% BSA with active skin \n\ntoxicity) \n\nInterrupt Piqray until rash is grade \u22641. \n\nInitiate or intensify topical/oral corticosteroid and \n\nantihistamine treatment. \n\nOnce improved to grade \u22641, then resume Piqray at the same \n\ndose level for first occurrence of rash and at next lower \n\ndose level, in case of second occurrence. \n\nGrade 4 (e.g. severe bullous, \n\nblistering or exfoliating skin \n\nconditions) \n\n(any % BSA associated with \n\nextensive superinfection, with \n\nintravenous antibiotics indicated; \n\nlife-threatening consequences) \n\nPermanently discontinue Piqray. \n\n1 Grading according to CTCAE Version 5.0 \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea \n\n \n\nTable 4 Dose modification and management for diarrhoea \n\n \n\nGrade1 Recommendation \n\nGrade 1 No Piqray dose adjustment is required. Initiate appropriate medical therapy and \n\nmonitor as clinically indicated. \n\nGrade 2 Initiate or intensify appropriate medical therapy and monitor as clinically \n\nindicated. Interrupt Piqray dose until recovery to grade \u22641, then resume Piqray \n\nat same dose level. \n\nGrade 3 or 42 Initiate or intensify appropriate medical therapy and monitor as clinically \n\nindicated. Interrupt Piqray dose until recovery to grade \u22641, then resume Piqray \n\nat the next lower dose level. \n1 Grading according to CTCAE Version 5.0. \n2 Patients should additionally be managed according to local standard of care, including electrolyte \n\nmonitoring, administration of antiemetics and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products and/or fluid \n\nreplacement and electrolyte supplements, as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nOther toxicities \n\n \n\nTable 5 Dose modification and management for other toxicities (excluding hyperglycaemia, \n\nrash and diarrhoea)1 \n\n \n\nGrade Recommendation \n\nGrade 1 or 2 No Piqray dose adjustment required. Initiate appropriate medical therapy and \n\nmonitor as clinically indicated2,3. \n\nGrade 3 Interrupt Piqray dose until improvement to grade \u22641, then resume Piqray at the \n\nnext lower dose level2. \n\nGrade 4 Permanently discontinue Piqray3. \n1 Grading according to CTCAE Version 5.0 \n2 For grade 2 and 3 pancreatitis, interrupt Piqray dose until recovery to grade \u22641 and resume at next \n\nlower dose level. Only one dose reduction is permitted. If toxicity recurs, permanently discontinue \n\nPiqray treatment. \n3 For grade 2 total bilirubin elevation, interrupt Piqray dose until recovery to grade \u22641 and resume at the \n\nsame dose if resolved in \u226414 days or resume at the next lower dose level if resolved in >14 days. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose regimen adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above (see section 5.2). There are \n\nlimited data in patients aged \u226575 years, and especially for those \u226585 years. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild \n\nor moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Caution should be used in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment as there is no experience with Piqray in this population. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on a hepatic impairment study in non-cancer subjects with impaired hepatic function, no dose \n\nadjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \n\nclass A, B or C, respectively) (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Piqray in children aged 0-18 years have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPiqray is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole. They should not be chewed, crushed or \n\nsplit prior to swallowing. Tablets that are broken, cracked or otherwise not intact should not be \n\ningested. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nFulvestrant \n\n \n\nDue to limited data in patients with prior fulvestrant use (n=39, study CBYL719X2101), efficacy is \n\nnot considered established in this population (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) \n\n \n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock), \n\nmanifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, dyspnoea, flushing, rash, fever or tachycardia, \n\nwere reported in patients treated with Piqray in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Piqray should be \n\npermanently discontinued and should not be re-introduced in patients with serious hypersensitivity \n\nreactions. Appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous reactions \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous reactions have been reported with alpelisib. In the phase III clinical study, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (EM) were reported in 1 (0.4%) and 3 \n\n(1.1%) patients, respectively. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has \n\nbeen reported in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPiqray treatment should not be initiated in patients with a history of severe cutaneous reactions. \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. a prodrome \n\nof fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions or progressive skin rash). If signs or symptoms of severe \n\ncutaneous reactions are present, Piqray should be interrupted until the aetiology of the reaction has \n\nbeen determined. A consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. \n\n \n\nIf a severe cutaneous reaction is confirmed, Piqray should be permanently discontinued. Piqray should \n\nnot be re-introduced in patients who have experienced previous severe cutaneous reactions. If a severe \n\ncutaneous reaction is not confirmed, Piqray may require treatment interruption, dose reduction or \n\ntreatment discontinuation as described in Table 3 (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nSevere hyperglycemia, including ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients treated with Piqray. \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical study, hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in patients who were diabetic \n\n(0 out of 12 patients [0%] with grade 1-2, and 10 out of 12 patients [83.3%] with grade 3-4), \n\npre-diabetic (42 out of 159 patients [26.4%] with grade 1-2, and 77 out of 159 patients [48.4%] with \n\ngrade 3-4), had BMI \u226530 at screening (13 out of 74 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, and 38 out of \n\n74 patients [51.4%] with grade 3-4) or \u226575 years of age (6 out of 34 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, \n\nand 19 out of 34 patients [55.9%] with grade 3-4). \n\n \n\nAs hyperglycaemia may occur with a rapid onset after starting treatment, it is recommended to \n\nself-monitor frequently in the first 4 weeks and especially within the first 2 weeks of treatment, as \n\nclinically indicated. A specific schedule for fasting glucose monitoring is recommended in Table 6. \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical study, patients with a history of diabetes mellitus intensified use of antidiabetic \n\nmedicinal products while on treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nAll patients should be instructed on lifestyle changes that may reduce hyperglycaemia (e.g. dietary \n\nrestrictions). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 6 Schedule of fasting glucose monitoring \n  \n\nRecommended schedule for the \n\nmonitoring of fasting glucose and \n\nHbA1c levels in all patients treated \n\nwith Piqray \n\nRecommended schedule of \n\nmonitoring of fasting glucose and \n\nHbA1c levels in patients with \n\ndiabetes, pre-diabetes, BMI \u226530 or \n\nage \u226575 years treated with Piqray \n\nAt screening, before \n\ninitiating treatment \n\nwith Piqray \n\nTest for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and optimise the patient\u2019s \n\nlevel of blood glucose (see Table 2). \n\nAfter initiating \n\ntreatment with Piqray  \n\nMonitor FPG at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 after treatment start and monthly \n\nthereafter. \n\nMonitor/self-monitor fasting glucose \n\nregularly, more frequently in the first \n\n4 weeks and especially within the first \n\n2 weeks of treatment, according to the \n\ninstructions of a healthcare \n\nprofessional*. \n\nMonitor/self-monitor fasting glucose \n\ndaily for the first 2 weeks of treatment. \n\nThen continue to monitor fasting \n\nglucose as frequently as needed to \n\nmanage hyperglycaemia according to \n\nthe instructions of a healthcare \n\nprofessional*. \n\nHbA1c should be monitored after 4 weeks of treatment and every 3 months \n\nthereafter. \n\nIf hyperglycaemia \n\ndevelops after \n\ninitiating treatment \n\nwith Piqray \n\nMonitor fasting glucose regularly, as per local standard of care and at least \n\nuntil fasting glucose decreases to normal levels. \n\nDuring treatment with antidiabetic medication, continue monitoring fasting \n\nglucose at least once a week for 8 weeks, followed by once every 2 weeks, \n\nand monitor fasting glucose according to the instructions of a healthcare \n\nprofessional with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycaemia. \n\n* All glucose monitoring should be performed at the physician\u2019s discretion as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e.g. excessive thirst, \n\nurinating more often than usual or greater amount of urine than usual, increased appetite with weight \n\nloss). \n\n \n\nIn the 190 patients with hyperglycaemia, 87.4% (166/190) were managed with antidiabetic \n\nmedication, and 75.8% (144/190) reported use of metformin as single agent or in combination with \n\nother antidiabetic medication (e.g. insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 \n\ninhibitors and sulfonylureas). \n\n \n\nOral antidiabetic medication was used in 154 patients. Out of these 154 patients, 17 (11.0%) \n\ndiscontinued study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. Concomitant insulin medication was used in \n\n54 patients; of these 13 (24.1%) discontinued study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nOut of 162 patients with grade \u22652 hyperglycaemia, 155 had at least 1 grade improvement, median time \n\nto improvement from the first event was 8 days (95% CI: 8 to 10 days). \n\n \n\nOf the patients with elevated FPG who continued fulvestrant treatment after discontinuing Piqray \n\n(n=58), 98.3% (n=57) had FPG levels that returned to baseline. \n\n \n\nThe safety of Piqray in patients with Type 1 and uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes has not been established \n\nas these patients were excluded from the phase III clinical study. Patients with a medical history of \n\nType 2 diabetes were included. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus may require intensified \n\ndiabetic treatment and should be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nBased on the severity of the hyperglycaemia, Piqray may require dose interruption, reduction or \n\ndiscontinuation as described in Table 2 (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nPneumonitis \n\n \n\nPneumonitis, including serious cases of pneumonitis/acute interstitial lung disease, have been reported \n\nin Piqray-treated patients in clinical studies. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or \n\nworsening respiratory symptoms. In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms or are \n\nsuspected to have developed pneumonitis, Piqray treatment should be interrupted immediately and the \n\npatient should be evaluated for pneumonitis. A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be \n\nconsidered in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, \n\ncough, dyspnoea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiological examination and in whom infectious, \n\nneoplastic and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Piqray should \n\nbe permanently discontinued in all patients with confirmed pneumonitis. \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea \n\n \n\nSevere diarrhoea and clinical consequences, such as dehydration and acute kidney injury, have been \n\nreported during treatment with Piqray and resolved with appropriate intervention. 59.5% of patients \n\n(n=169) experienced diarrhoea during treatment with Piqray. Grade 3 diarrhoea occurred in 7% (n=20) \n\nof patients with no reported cases of grade 4. Among patients with grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (n=76), the \n\nmedian time to onset was 50 days (range: 1 to 954 days). \n\n \n\nDose reductions of Piqray were required in 5.6% of patients and 2.8% of patients discontinued Piqray \n\ndue to diarrhoea. In the 169 patients who experienced diarrhoea, antidiarrhoeal medications (e.g. \n\nloperamide) were required to manage symptoms in 64.5% (109/169). \n\n \n\nBased on the severity of the diarrhoea, Piqray may require dose interruption, reduction or \n\ndiscontinuation as described in Table 4 (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to start antidiarrhoeal treatment, increase oral fluids and notify their \n\nphysician if diarrhoea occurs while taking Piqray. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when Piqray and bisphosphonates or denosumab are used either \n\nsimultaneously or sequentially. Piqray treatment should not be initiated in patients with ongoing \n\nosteonecrosis of the jaw from previous or concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates/denosumab. \n\nPatients should be advised to promptly report any new or worsening oral symptoms (such as dental \n\nmobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of mouth sores, or discharge) during treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nIn patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw, standard medical management should be initiated. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic visceral disease \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of this medicinal product have not been studied in patients with symptomatic \n\nvisceral disease. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \n\nessentially 'sodium-free'. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nMedicinal products that may increase alpelisib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nBCRP inhibitors \n\nAlpelisib is a substrate for BCRP in vitro. BCRP is involved in the hepatobiliary export and intestinal \n\nsecretion of alpelisib, therefore inhibition of BCRP in the liver and in the intestine during elimination \n\nmay lead to an increase in systemic exposure of alpelisib. Therefore, caution and monitoring for \n\ntoxicity are advised during concomitant treatment with inhibibitors of BCRP (e.g. eltrombopag, \n\nlapatinib, pantoprazole). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may decrease alpelisib plasma concentrations \n\n \n\nAcid-reducing agents \n\nThe co-administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine in combination with a single 300 mg \n\noral dose of alpelisib slightly reduced the bioavailability of alpelisib and decreased overall exposure of \n\nalpelisib. In the presence of a low-fat low-calorie (LFLC) meal, AUCinf was decreased on average by \n\n21% and Cmax by 36% with ranitidine. In the absence of food, the effect was more pronounced with a \n\n30% decrease in AUCinf and a 51% decrease in Cmax with ranitidine compared to the fasted state \n\nwithout co-administration of ranitidine. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant \n\neffect of co-administration of acid-reducing agents, including proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor \n\nantagonists and antacids, on the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib. Therefore, alpelisib can be \n\nco-administered with acid-reducing agents, provided alpelisib is taken immediately after food (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products whose plasma concentrations may be altered by alpelisib \n\n \n\nBased on the results of metabolic in vitro induction and inhibition studies, alpelisib may induce the \n\nmetabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and \n\nCYP3A and may inhibit the metabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal products metabolised \n\nby CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 (time-dependent inhibition) if sufficiently high \n\nconcentrations are achieved in vivo. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 substrates \n\nNo dose adjustment is required when co-administering Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. \n\neverolimus, midazolam). \n\n \n\nIn a drug-drug interaction study, co-administration of alpelisib with everolimus, a sensitive CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrate, confirmed that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions (increase in \n\nAUC by 11.2%) between alpelisib and CYP3A4 substrates. No change in everolimus exposure was \n\nobserved at alpelisib doses ranging from 250 to 300 mg. \n\n \n\nCaution is recommended when Piqray is used in combination with CYP3A4 substrates that also \n\npossess an additional time-dependent inhibition and induction potential on CYP3A4 that affects their \n\nown metabolism (e.g. rifampicin, ribociclib, encorafenib). \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic index \n\nIn the absence of clinical data on CYP2C9, caution is recommended. In vitro evaluations indicated \n\nthat the pharmacological activity of CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as \n\nwarfarin may be reduced by the CYP2C9 induction effects of alpelisib. \n\n \n\nCYP2B6 sensitive substrates with narrow therapeutic index \n\nSensitive CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion) or CYP2B6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic \n\nwindow should be used with caution in combination with Piqray, as alpelisib may reduce the clinical \n\nactivity of such medicinal products. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nSubstances that are substrates of transporters \n\nIn vitro evaluations indicated that alpelisib (and/or its metabolite BZG791) has a potential to inhibit \n\nthe activities of OAT3 drug transporters and intestinal BCRP and P-gp. Piqray should be used with \n\ncaution in combination with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit a narrow \n\ntherapeutic index because Piqray may increase the systemic exposure of these substrates. \n\n \n\nHormonal contraceptives \n\n \n\nNo clinical studies were conducted assessing the drug-drug-interaction potential between alpelisib and \n\nhormonal contraceptives. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPiqray is indicated in men and postmenopausal women. It is not to be used in women who are, or may \n\nbe, pregnant or breast-feeding (see section 4.1). \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nFemales of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies and the mechanism of action \n\nhave shown that alpelisib can be harmful to the developing foetus. Embryo-foetal development studies \n\nin rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral administration of alpelisib during organogenesis \n\ninduced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nIn case females of reproductive potential take Piqray, they should use effective contraception (e.g. \n\ndouble-barrier method) when taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment with \n\nPiqray. \n\n \n\nMale patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant or who could become pregnant \n\nshould use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after \n\nstopping treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to section 4.6 of the prescribing information for fulvestrant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nPiqray is not indicated and is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant (see section 4.1). \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of alpelisib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Piqray is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of \n\nchildbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nThe pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to starting treatment \n\nwith Piqray. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known if alpelisib is excreted in human or animal milk. \n\n \n\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed infant, it is recommended that \n\nwomen should not breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of alpelisib on fertility. Based on repeated dose toxicity studies in \n\nanimals, alpelisib may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nPiqray has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be \n\ncautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue or blurred vision during \n\ntreatment (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety profile is based on data from 284 patients in the Piqray plus fulvestrant arm of the \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study. \n\n \n\nThe most common ADRs (reported at a frequency >20% in the combined mutant and non-mutant \n\nstudy population) were plasma glucose increased (79.2%), creatinine increased (67.6%), diarrhoea \n\n(59.5%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (53.2%), rash (51.8%), lymphocyte count decreased \n\n(55.3%), nausea (46.8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (44.0%), anaemia (44.0%), fatigue \n\n(43.3%), lipase increased (42.6%), decreased appetite (35.9%), stomatitis (30.3%), vomiting (28.5%), \n\nweight decreased (27.8%), hypocalcaemia (27.8%), plasma glucose decreased (26.8%), activated \n\npartial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolonged (22.2%) and alopecia (20.4%). \n\n \n\nThe most common grade 3 or 4 ADRs (reported at a frequency \u22652%) were plasma glucose increased \n\n(39.1%), rash (19.4%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (12.0%), lymphocyte count decreased \n\n(9.2%), diarrhoea (7.0%), lipase increased (7.0%), hypokalaemia (6.3%), fatigue (5.6%), weight \n\ndecreased (5.3%), anaemia (4.9%), hypertension (4.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (4.2%), \n\nnausea (2.8%), creatinine increased (2.8%), stomatitis (2.5%), hypocalcaemia (2.1%) and mucosal \n\ninflammation (2.1%). \n\n \n\nThe most common ADRs leading to treatment discontinuation were hyperglycaemia (6.3%), rash \n\n(4.2%), diarrhoea (2.8%) and fatigue (2.5%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nADRs from the phase III clinical study and post-marketing experience (Table 7) are listed by \n\nMedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, \n\nwith the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order \n\nof decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug \n\nreaction is based on the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nTable 7 ADRs observed in phase III clinical study and during post-marketing experience \n \n\nAdverse drug reaction Any grade (%) Grade 3 or 4 (%) \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUrinary tract infection1 Very common 29 (10.2) 2 (0.7)* \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAnaemia Very common 125 (44.0) 14 (4.9)* \n\nLymphocyte count decreased Very common 157 (55.3) 26 (9.2) \n\nPlatelet count decreased Very common 43 (15.1) 4 (1.4)* \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nHypersensitivity2 Common 11 (3.9) 2 (0.7)* \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nGlucose plasma increased Very common 225 (79.2) 111 (39.1)  \n\nGlucose plasma decreased Very common 76 (26.8) 1 (0.4) \n\nDecreased appetite Very common 102 (35.9) 2 (0.7)* \n\nHypokalaemia Very common 42 (14.8) 18 (6.3) \n\nHypocalcaemia Very common 79 (27.8) 6 (2.1) \n\nMagnesium decreased Very common 34 (12.0) 1 (0.4) \n\nDehydration Common 10 (3.5) 1 (0.4)* \n\nKetoacidosis3 Uncommon 2 (0.7) 2 (0.7) \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia Common 22 (7.7)  \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadache Very common 55 (19.4) 2 (0.7)* \n\nDysgeusia4 Very common 44 (15.5) 1 (0.4)* \n\nEye disorders \n\nVision blurred Common 15 (5.3) 1 (0.4)* \n\nDry eye Common 10 (3.5)  \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHypertension Common 27 (9.5) 13 (4.6) \n\nLymphoedema Common 16 (5.6)  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nPneumonitis5 Common 5 (1.8) 1 (0.4)* \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDiarrhoea Very common 169 (59.5) 20 (7.0)* \n\nNausea Very common 133 (46.8) 8 (2.8)* \n\nStomatitis6 Very common 86 (30.3) 7 (2.5)* \n\nVomiting Very common 81 (28.5) 2 (0.7)* \n\nAbdominal pain Very common 50 (17.6) 4 (1.4)* \n\nDyspepsia Very common 33 (11.6)  \n\nToothache Common 13 (4.6) 1 (0.4)* \n\nGingivitis Common 11 (3.9) 1 (0.4)* \n\nGingival pain Common 9 (3.2)  \n\nCheilitis Common 8 (2.8)  \n\nPancreatitis Uncommon 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nRash7 Very common 147 (51.8) 55 (19.4)* \n\nAlopecia Very common 58 (20.4)  \n\nPruritus Very common 53 (18.7) 2 (0.7)* \n\nDry skin8 Very common 53 (18.7) 1 (0.4)* \n\nErythema9 Common 18 (6.3) 2 (0.7)* \n\nDermatitis10 Common 10 (3.5) 2 (0.7)* \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome \n\nCommon 5 (1.8)  \n\nErythema multiforme Common 3 (1.1) 2 (0.7)* \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome Uncommon 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4)* \n\nDrug reaction with eosinophilia and \n\nsystemic symptoms (DRESS)# \n\nNot known Not known Not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms Common 22 (7.7)  \n\nMyalgia Common 19 (6.7) 1 (0.4)* \n\nOsteonecrosis of jaw Common 16 (5.6) 5 (1.8)* \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nAcute kidney injury Common 16 (5.6) 5 (1.8) \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nFatigue11 Very common 123 (43.3) 16 (5.6)* \n\nMucosal inflammation Very common 56 (19.7) 6 (2.1)* \n\nOedema peripheral Very common 47 (16.5)  \n\nPyrexia Very common 45 (15.8) 2 (0.7) \n\nMucosal dryness12 Very common 36 (12.7) 1 (0.4) \n\nOedema13 Common 18 (6.3)  \n\nInvestigations \n\nWeight decreased Very common 79 (27.8) 15 (5.3)* \n\nBlood creatinine increased Very common 192 (67.6) 8 (2.8)* \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase \n\nincreased \n\nVery common 151 (53.2) 34 (12.0) \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Very common 125 (44.0) 12 (4.2)* \n\nLipase increased Very common 121 (42.6) 20 (7.0) \n\nActivated partial thromboplastin \n\ntime (aPTT) prolonged \n\nVery common \n63 (22.2) 2 (0.7) \n\nAlbumin decreased Very common 41 (14.4) 1 (0.4) \n\nGlycosylated haemoglobin \n\nincreased \n\nCommon \n8 (2.8) 0 \n\n* No grade 4 ADRs were observed \n\n# Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience.

Among \n\nall patients with hyperglycaemia of grade \u22652 (FPG \u2265160 mg/dl), the median time to first occurrence \n\nwas 15 days (range: 5 days to 900 days) (based on laboratory findings). The median duration of \n\ngrade \u22652 hyperglycaemia was 10 days (95% CI: 8 to 13 days). In patients with grade \u22652 \n\nhyperglycaemia, median time to improvement (at least one grade from the first event) was 8 days \n\n(95% CI: 8 to 10 days). In all patients who continued on fulvestrant after discontinuing Piqray, FPG \n\nlevels returned to baseline (normal). \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia was managed with antidiabetic medicinal products, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nRash \n\nRash events (including rash maculopapular, macular, generalised, papular and pruritic, dermatitis and \n\ndermatitis acneiform) were reported in 153 (53.9%) patients. Rash was predominantly mild or \n\nmoderate (grade 1 or 2) and responsive to therapy, and in some cases rash was accompanied by \n\npruritus and dry skin. Grade 2 and 3 events were reported in 13.7% and 20.1% of patients, \n\nrespectively, with a median time to first onset of 12 days (range: 2 days to 220 days). \n\n \n\nAmong patients who received prophylactic antirash treatment including antihistamines, rash was \n\nreported less frequently than in the overall population; 26.1% vs 53.9% for all grades, 11.4% vs 20.1% \n\nfor grade 3, and 3.4% vs 4.2% for rash leading to the permanent discontinuation of Piqray. \n\nAccordingly, antihistamines may be initiated prophylactically, at the time of initiation of treatment \n\nwith Piqray. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting) \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were reported in 59.5%, 46.8% and 28.5% of the patients, \n\nrespectively (see Table 7). \n\n \n\nGrade 2 and 3 diarrhoea events were reported in 19.7% and 7.0% of patients, respectively, with a \n\nmedian time to onset of grade \u22652 diarrhoea of 50 days (range: 1 day to 954 days). \n\n \n\nSevere diarrhoea and clinical consequences, such as dehydration and acute kidney injury, have been \n\nreported during treatment with Piqray and resolved with appropriate intervention (see Table 4). \n\nAntiemetics (e.g. ondansetron) and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) were used in \n\n28/153 (17.6%) and 109/169 (64.5%) patients, respectively, to manage symptoms. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n\nONJ was reported in 5.6% patients (16/284) in the Piqray plus fulvestrant arm. Fifteen patients \n\nexperiencing ONJ were exposed to concomitant bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid). Therefore, in \n\npatients receiving Piqray and bisphosphonates, an increased risk of development of ONJ cannot be \n\nexcluded. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn patients \u226565 years of age treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant, there was a higher incidence of \n\ngrade 3-4 hyperglycaemia (45.3%) compared to patients <65 years of age (33.5%), while in patients \n\n<75 years of age, grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was 36% compared to 55.9% in patients \u226575 years of age. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions associated with overdose have been consistent with the safety profile of Piqray \n\nand included hyperglycaemia, nausea, asthenia and rash. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nGeneral symptomatic and supportive measures should be initiated in all cases of overdose where \n\nnecessary. There is no known antidote for Piqray. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX65 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAlpelisib is an \u03b1-specific class I phosphatidylinositol3kinase (PI3K\u03b1) inhibitor. Gain-of-function \n\nmutations in the gene encoding the catalytic \u03b1-subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) lead to activation of PI3K\u03b1 \n\nand AKT-signalling, cellular transformation and the generation of tumours in in vitro and in vivo \n\nmodels. \n\n \n\nIn breast cancer cell lines, alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets \n\nincluding AKT, and showed activity in cell lines harbouring a PIK3CA mutation. \n\n \n\nIn vivo, alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and reduced tumour growth in xenograft \n\nmodels, including models of breast cancer. \n\n \n\nPI3K inhibition by alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in oestrogen receptor \n\n(ER) transcription in breast cancer cells. The combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant demonstrated \n\nincreased anti-tumour activity compared to either treatment alone in xenograft models derived from \n\nER-positive, PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines. \n\n \n\nThe PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is responsible for glucose homeostasis, and hyperglycaemia is an \n\nexpected on-target adverse reaction of PI3K inhibition. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPiqray was evaluated in a pivotal phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of \n\nalpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women, and men, with HR+, \n\nHER2- advanced (locoregionally recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer whose disease had progressed \n\nor recurred on or after an aromatase-inhibitor-based treatment (with or without CDK4/6 combination). \n\n \n\nA total of 572 patients were enrolled into two cohorts, one cohort with PIK3CA mutation and one \n\ncohort without PIK3CA mutation breast cancer. Patients were randomised to receive either alpelisib \n\n300 mg plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by \n\npresence of lung and/or liver metastasis and previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor(s). \n\n \n\nIn the cohort with PIK3CA mutation, 169 patients with one or more PIK3CA mutations (C420R, \n\nE542K, E545A, E545D [1635G>T only], E545G, E545K, Q546E, Q546R, H1047L, H1047R or \n\nH1047Y) were randomised to receive alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant and 172 patients were \n\nrandomised to receive placebo in combination with fulvestrant. In this cohort 170 (49.9%) patients had \n\nliver/lung metastases and 20 (5.9%) patients had received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients had a median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 92 years). 44.9% patients were 65 years of age or \n\nolder and \u226485 years. The patients included were White (66.3%), Asian (21.7%) and Black or African \n\nAmerican (1.2%). The study population included one male subject enrolled in the PIK3CA mutant \n\ncohort and treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant. 66.0% and 33.4% of subjects had an ECOG \n\nperformance status of 0 and 1, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n97.7% of patients had received prior endocrine therapy. In 67.7% of subjects, the last therapy prior to \n\nstudy enrollment was endocrine therapy. Letrozole and anastrozole were the most commonly used \n\nendocrine therapies. The setting of last endocrine therapy prior to study enrollment was therapeutic in \n\n47.8% of subjects and adjuvant therapy in 51.9% of subjects. Overall, 85.6% of the patients were \n\nconsidered to have endocrine-resistant disease; primary endocrine resistance (de novo resistance) was \n\nobserved in 13.2% and secondary endocrine resistance (relapse/progression following an initial \n\nresponse) in 72.4% of patients. \n\n \n\nDemographics and baseline disease characteristics, ECOG performance status, tumour burden and \n\nprior antineoplastic therapy were well balanced between the study arms. \n\n \n\nDuring the randomised treatment phase, alpelisib 300 mg or placebo was administered orally once \n\ndaily on a continuous basis. Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered intramuscularly on cycle 1 days 1 \n\nand 15 and then at day 1 of a 28-day cycle during treatment phase (administration \u00b13 days). \n\n \n\nPatients were not allowed to cross over from placebo to alpelisib during the study or after disease \n\nprogression. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation \n\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), based on the investigator assessment in patients with \n\nPIK3CA mutation advanced breast cancer. The key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS) for \n\npatients with PIK3CA mutation status. \n\n \n\nOther secondary endpoints included PFS for patients without PIK3CA mutation, OS for patients \n\nwithout PIK3CA mutation. \n\n \n\nThe median duration of follow-up (between randomisation and data cut-off date of 12-June-2018) in \n\nthe cohort with PIK3CA mutation was 20 months. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy results in the cohort with PIK3CA mutation demonstrated a statistically significant \n\nimprovement in PFS in patients receiving alpelisib plus fulvestrant, compared to patients receiving \n\nplacebo plus fulvestrant with an estimated 35% risk reduction of disease progression or death. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nTable 8 Study C2301 - Summary of efficacy results (cohort with PIK3CA mutation) \n \n\n Piqray + fulvestrant \n\n(n=169) \n\nPlacebo + fulvestrant \n\n(n=172) \n\nData using primary analysis data cut-off date of 12 June 2018 \n\nMedian progression free survival (PFS) (months, 95% CI) \n\nInvestigator radiological assessment# \n\nPIK3CA mutant cohort \n\n(N=341) \n\n11.0 \n\n(7.5-14.5) \n\n5.7 \n\n(3.7-7.4) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.65 (0.50-0.85) \n\np-valuea 0.00065 \n\nBlinded independent review committee assessment*# \n\nPIK3CA mutant cohort \n\n(N=173) \n\n11.1 \n\n(7.3-16.8) \n\n3.7 \n\n(2.1-5.6) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.48 (0.32-0.71) \n\np-value N/A \n\nData using 2nd interim OS data cut-off date of 30 September 2019 \n\nMedian progression free survival (PFS) (months, 95% CI) \n\nInvestigator radiological assessment# \n\nPIK3CA mutant cohort \n\n(N=341) \n\n11.0 \n\n(7.5-14.5) \n\n5.7 \n\n(3.7-7.4) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.64 (0.50-0.81) \n\np-value N/A \n\nOverall survival (OS) (months, 95% CI) \n\nPIK3CA mutant cohort \n\n(N=341) \n\n40.6 \n\n(32.2-NE) \n\n31.2 \n\n(26.8-NE) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.77 (0.56-1.06) \n\np-valuea 0.06 \nCI = confidence interval; N = number of patients; N/A = is not applicable; NE = not evaluable \na p-value is obtained from the one-sided stratified log-rank test. \n# Per RECIST 1.1 \n\n* Based on 50% audit-based approach \n\n \n\nIn the cohort with PIK3CA mutation, PFS subgroup analyses per investigator assessment by \n\nrandomisation stratification factors showed a generally consistent treatment effect in favour of the \n\nalpelisib arm, irrespective of presence or absence of lung/liver metastases. \n\n \n\nAmong 20 patients with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.17, \n\n1.36); median PFS was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7, 3.6) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm and \n\n5.5 months (95% CI: 1.6, 16.8) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. \n\n \n\nUsing a data cut-off date of 12-Jun-2018, PFS results for the subgroup of endocrine resistant patients \n\n(HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85, n=292) and endocrine sensitive patients (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.35, \n\n2.17, n=39) were in favour of the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. The number of endocrine sensitive \n\npatients with a PIK3CA mutation was limited (n=39) and the results should be interpreted with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\nUsing a data cut-off date of 12-Jun-2018, the overall response rate in patients with measurable disease \n\nat baseline was 35.7% (95% CI: 27.4, 44.7) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 16.2% (95% CI: \n\n10.4, 23.5) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier plot of progression free survival in cohort with PIK3CA mutation \n\nper local investigator assessment \n \n\n \n \n\nCohort without PIK3CA mutation \n\nNo PFS benefit was observed in patients whose tumours did not have a PIK3CA tissue mutation. \n\n \n\nPrior use of fulvestrant in study CBYL719X2102 \n\nPatients with prior fulvestrant use were not included in the pivotal study. In the phase I study \n\nCBYL719X2101, 39 subjects reported prior fulvestrant use. The best overall responses to treatment \n\nwith alpelisib plus fulvestrant for the 21 subjects with PIK3CA mutations and measurable disease at \n\nbaseline were partial response in 7 subjects, stable disease in 11 subjects, and progressive disease in \n\n2 subjects. Hence, the evidence of efficacy of this treatment in patients previously treated with \n\nfulvestrant is not established due to the limited data at this time (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nPiqray in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use). \n\n \n\n  \n\nCensoring times \n\nAlpelisib + fulv.

Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 300 to 400 mg. The \n\npharmcokinetics were comparable in both oncology patients and healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of alpelisib, median time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) \n\nranged between 2.0 to 4.0 hours, independent of dose, time or regimen. Based on absorption modelling \n\nbioavailability was estimated to be very high (>99%) under fed conditions but lower under fasted \n\nconditions (~68.7% at a 300 mg dose). Steady-state plasma levels of alpelisib after daily dosing can be \n\nexpected to be reached on day 3 following onset of therapy in most patients. \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nAlpelisib absorption is affected by food. In healthy volunteers after a single 300 mg oral dose of \n\nalpelisib, compared to the fasted state, a high-fat high-calorie (HFHC) meal (985 calories with 58.1 g \n\nof fat) increased AUCinf by 73% and Cmax by 84%, and a LFLC meal (334 calories with 8.7 g of fat) \n\nincreased AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 145%. No significant difference was found for AUCinf between \n\nLFLC and HFHC with a geometric mean ratio of 0.978 (CI: 0.876, 1.09), showing that neither fat \n\ncontent nor overall calorific intake has a considerable impact on absorption. The increase in \n\ngastrointestinal solubility by bile, secreted in response to food intake, is the potential cause of the food \n\neffect. Hence, Piqray should be taken immediately after food at approximately same time each day. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nAlpelisib moderately binds to protein with a free fraction of 10.8% regardless of concentration. \n\nAlpelisib was equally distributed between red blood cells and plasma with a mean in vivo \n\nblood-to-plasma ratio of 1.03. As alpelisib is a substrate of human efflux transporters, penetration of \n\nthe blood-brain barrier is not expected to occur in humans. The volume of distribution of alpelisib at \n\nsteady state (Vss/F) is estimated at 114 litres (intersubject CV% 46%). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that formation of the hydrolysis metabolite BZG791 by chemical and \n\nenzymatic amide hydrolysis was a major metabolic pathway, followed by minor contribution of \n\nCYP3A4. Alpelisib hydrolysis occurs systemically by both chemical decomposition and enzymatic \n\nhydrolysis via ubiquitously expressed, high-capacity enzymes (esterases, amidases, choline esterase) \n\nnot limited to the liver. CYP3A4-mediated metabolites and glucuronides amounted to ~15% of the \n\ndose; BZG791 accounted for ~40-45% of the dose. The rest of the absorbed fraction of the dose was \n\nexcreted as alpelisib. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAlpelisib exhibits low clearance with 9.2 l/h (CV% 21%) based on population pharmacokinetic \n\nanalysis under fed conditions. The population-derived half-life, independent of dose and time, was 8 to \n\n9 hours at steady state with 300 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nIn a human mass-balance study, after oral administration, alpelisib and its metabolites were excreted in \n\nthe faeces (81.0%), mainly through hepatobiliary export and/or intestinal secretion of alpelisib, or \n\nmetabolised to BZG791. Excretion in the urine is minor (13.5%), with unchanged alpelisib (2%). \n\nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-alpelisib, 94.5% of the total administered radioactive dose was \n\nrecovered within 8 days. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics were found to be linear with respect to dose and time under fed conditions \n\nbetween 30 and 450 mg. After multiple doses, alpelisib exposure (AUC) at steady state is only slightly \n\nhigher than that of a single dose, with an average accumulation of 1.3 to 1.5 with a daily dosing \n\nregimen. \n\n \n\nMetabolic interaction \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 substrates \n\nIn a drug-drug interaction study with the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate everolimus, AUC increased by \n\n11.2%. No clinically meaningful change is expected as a result of drug interaction with CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors \n\nThe effects of CPY3A4 inducers or inhibitors have not been evaluated in clinical studies. No clinically \n\nmeaningful changes in overall exposure are expected as a result of the low fraction (<15%) \n\nmetabolised by CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nTransporter-based interaction \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, inhibition of the renal organic anion transporter OAT3 by alpelisib (and/or its \n\nmetabolite BZG791) cannot be discarded in patients at the therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\nAlpelisib showed only weak in vitro inhibition towards the ubiquitously expressed efflux transporters \n\n(P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP), solute carrier transporters at the liver inlet (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT1) and solute carrier transporters in the kidney (OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K). As unbound \n\nsystemic steady-state concentrations (or concentrations at the liver inlet) at both the therapeutic dose \n\nand maximum tolerated dose are significantly lower than the experimentally determined unbound \n\ninhibition constants or IC50, the inhibition will not translate into clinical significance. Due to high \n\nalpelisib concentrations in the intestinal lumen, an effect on intestinal P-gp and BCRP cannot be fully \n\nexcluded. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nEffect of age, weight and gender \n\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, \n\nbody weight, or gender on the systemic exposure of alpelisib that would require Piqray dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients (below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Piqray in children aged 0-18 years have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nElderly (age 65 years or above) \n\nOf 284 patients who received Piqray in the phase III study (in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm), \n\n117 patients were \u226565 years of age and 34 patients were between 75 and 87 years of age. No overall \n\ndifferences in exposure of Piqray were observed between these patients and younger patients (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nRace/Ethnicity \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses and pharmacokinetic analyses from a phase I study in Japanese \n\ncancer patients showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of ethnicity on the systemic \n\nexposure of Piqray. \n\n \n\nNon-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple daily doses of Piqray for \n\nJapanese patients were very similar to those reported in the Caucasian population. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 117 patients with normal renal function \n\n(eGFR \u226590 ml/min/1.73 m2) / (CLcr \u226590 ml/min), 108 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 \n\nto <90 ml/min/1.73 m2)/ (CLcr 60 to <90 ml/min), and 45 patients with moderate renal impairment \n\n(eGFR 30 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure \n\nof alpelisib (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on a pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment, moderate and severe hepatic \n\nimpairment had negligible effect on the exposure of alpelisib (see section 4.2). The mean exposure for \n\nalpelisib was increased 1.26-fold in patients with severe (GMR: 1.00 for Cmax; 1.26 for \n\nAUClast/AUCinf) hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 230 patients with normal hepatic \n\nfunction, 41 patients with mild hepatic impairment and no patients with moderate hepatic impairment, \n\nfurther supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study, mild and moderate \n\nhepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of alpelisib (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity \n\n \n\nThe majority of the observed alpelisib effects were related to the pharmacological activity of alpelisib \n\nas a p110\u03b1-specific inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, such as the influence on the glucose homeostasis \n\nresulting in hyperglycaemia and the risk of increased blood pressure. The bone marrow and lymphoid \n\ntissue, pancreas and some reproductive organs of both genders were the main target organs for adverse \n\neffects. Effects on bone marrow and lymphoid tissue were generally reversible on cessation of \n\ntreatment. Effects on the pancreas and reproductive organs did not fully reverse but showed a tendency \n\ntowards reversion. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular safety pharmacology \n\nIn vitro inhibition of hERG channels (IC50 of 9.4 \u00b5M) was shown at concentrations ~13-fold higher \n\nthan the exposure in humans, at the recommended dose of 300 mg/day. No relevant \n\nelectrophysiological effect was seen in dogs. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. \n\n \n\nResults of standard genotoxicity studies with alpelisib were negative. In a repeated-dose rat toxicity \n\nstudy, where micronucleus analysis was integrated, exposure levels of alpelisib were 1.4-fold higher in \n\nmales and 2-fold higher in females than therapeutic exposure in adult humans treated with the \n\nrecommended dose. Therefore, the genotoxicity potential of alpelisib in humans cannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral administration of \n\nalpelisib during organogenesis induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity. In rats and \n\nrabbits, following prenatal exposure to alpelisib, increased incidences of pre- and post-implantation \n\nlosses, reduced foetal weights and increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (enlarged brain \n\nventricle, decreased bone ossification and skeletal malformations) were observed starting at exposures \n\nbelow those in humans at the highest recommended dose of 300 mg, indicating potential clinical \n\nrelevance. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nA fertility study in rats has not been performed. However, in repeated dose toxicity studies, adverse \n\neffects were observed in reproductive organs, such as vaginal or uterine atrophy and oestrus cycle \n\nvariations in rats, decreases in prostate and testes weight in rats and dogs and prostate atrophy in dogs \n\nat clinically relevant doses based on AUC. \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity \n\n \n\nAn in vitro phototoxicity test on the mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cell line did not identify a relevant \n\nphototoxicity potential for alpelisib. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What Piqray is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Piqray \n\n3. How to take Piqray \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Piqray \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Piqray is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Piqray is \nPiqray contains the active substance alpelisib, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nphosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. \n\n \n\nWhat Piqray is used for \nPiqray is used for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with a type of breast cancer \n\ncalled advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \n\n(HER2)-negative breast cancer. Piqray is used in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal anticancer \n\ntherapy, in patients whose cancer has not responded to other hormonal treatments and who have \n\ncertain changes (mutations) in a gene called PIK3CA. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will take a sample of your blood and/or tumour tissue, which will be tested for these \n\nPIK3CA mutations. If the result is positive your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nHow Piqray works \nPiqray works by blocking the effects of enzymes called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K). These \n\nenzymes help cancer cells to grow and multiply. By blocking their action, Piqray can reduce growth \n\nand spread of the cancer and help to destroy cancer cells. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Piqray works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Piqray \n\n \n\nFollow all of your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, as they may differ from the general information in \n\nthis leaflet. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nDo not take Piqray: \n- if you are allergic to alpelisib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Piqray. \n\n \n\nIf any of the following apply to you before taking Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist: \n\n- if you have or have ever had high levels of sugar in your blood or diabetes (or signs of increased \n\nsugar levels, such as excessive thirst and dry mouth, needing to pass urine more often than \n\nusual, producing greater amounts of urine than usual, tiredness, nausea, increased appetite with \n\nweight loss). \n\n- if you have ever had Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM), drug \n\nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN; possible symptoms include red skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, \n\nwith or without fever, rash). \n\n- if you have a severe bone disease that affects the jaw (osteonecrosis of the jaw, ONJ). \n\n \n\nIf any of the following apply to you during your treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist \n\nimmediately: \n\n- Rash, itching, hives, breathlessness, difficulty breathing, wheezing, cough, light-headedness, \n\ndizziness, changes in levels of consciousness, low blood pressure, reddening of the skin, \n\nswelling of the face or throat, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin (possible signs of \n\nsevere allergic reactions). \n\n- New or changing breathing problems such as difficult or painful breathing, cough, rapid \n\nbreathing, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin, hiccups (possible signs of \n\nnon-infectious pneumonitis or pneumonia). \n\n- Increased thirst and dry mouth, passing urine more often than usual, tiredness, nausea, increased \n\nappetite with weight loss (possible signs of increased blood sugar levels) \n\n- Rash, reddening of the skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, sometimes with \n\nfever (possible signs of one of the following skin conditions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), \n\nerythema multiforme (EM), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \n\nor toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)). \n\n- New or worsening symptoms affecting your mouth (such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, \n\nnon-healing of mouth sores, or discharge). \n\n- Piqray can cause severe diarrhoea. \n\nYour doctor may need to treat these symptoms, temporarily interrupt your treatment, reduce your \n\ndose, or permanently stop your treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nBlood tests before and during your treatment with Piqray \nYour doctor will carry out blood tests before and regularly during treatment with Piqray to monitor \n\nyour blood sugar. Based on the results, your doctor will take any necessary actions, such as \n\nprescribing a medicine to lower blood sugar levels. If necessary, your doctor may decide to \n\ntemporarily interrupt treatment with Piqray or reduce your Piqray dose to allow your blood sugar to \n\ndecrease. Your doctor may also decide to stop Piqray treatment permanently. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nMake sure that you regularly test your blood sugar before you start treatment, during treatment \n\nand after you stop treatment with Piqray. \n\n- Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to have the blood tests. Treatment with Piqray \n\nmay only be started if tests show that you have the right levels of sugar in your blood. This is \n\nbecause Piqray can increase sugar in your blood (hyperglycaemia), which could be serious and \n\nneed treatment. Only regular fasting blood tests can tell the doctor if you are developing \n\nhyperglycaemia. \n\n- Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to test your blood sugar. This will be required \n\nmore frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment and especially in the first 2 weeks of treatment \n\nwith Piqray. Afterwards, blood tests will be needed at least once a month, depending on your \n\nblood sugar levels. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nPiqray is not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Piqray \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes in particular: \n\n- eltrombopag, a medicine used to treat low platelet count \n\n- medicines used to treat breast cancer, such as lapatinib, everolimus or ribociclib \n\n- pantoprazole, a medicine used to treat heartburn and reduce the amount of acid produced in your \n\nstomach \n\n- midazolam, a medicine used to for sedation or sleep disturbances \n\n- rifampicin, a medicine to treat tuberculosis and some other serious infections \n\n- encorafenib, a medicine used to treat a certain type of skin cancer \n\n- warfarin, a medicine used reduce the clotting ability of the blood \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPiqray must not be used by women who are, or may be pregnant or breast-feeding. Piqray may harm \n\nan unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \n\npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Women should not breast-feed during treatment and \n\nfor at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of \n\ntaking Piqray during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out an existing pregnancy \n\nbefore starting you on treatment with Piqray. This may include having a pregnancy test. \n\n \n\nWomen who could become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control during treatment \n\nand for at least 1 week after stopping Piqray. Ask your doctor about suitable methods. If you think you \n\nmay be pregnant after starting treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment, male patients should use a condom \n\nfor intercourse with female partners who could become pregnant. If the partner of a male patient \n\nsuspects that she has become pregnant during this time, she should inform a doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nTreatment with Piqray may lead to tiredness. You should therefore be cautious when driving or using \n\nmachines during your treatment with Piqray. \n\n \n\nPiqray contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \n\nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n3. How to take Piqray \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nHow much Piqray to take \n\nThe usual starting dose of Piqray is 300 mg once daily. Your doctor will decide on the right dose for \n\nyou. \n\n \n\nDepending on the dose prescribed, the number of tablets to take is as follows: \n\n- 300 mg dose: two 150 mg tablets \n\n- 250 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet and one 50 mg tablet \n\n- 200 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet \n\n \n\nIf you vomit after you take the Piqray tablet(s), do not take any more tablets until your next scheduled \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine the dose of fulvestrant you should receive and when you should receive it. \n\n \n\nDepending on how your body responds to the treatment with Piqray, your doctor may want to adjust \n\nyour Piqray dose. It is very important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. If you have certain side \n\neffects, your doctor may ask you to change to a lower dose, to interrupt treatment for a time, or to stop \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Piqray \n\nPiqray tablets are supplied in packs containing blister cards. Each blister card shows the tablet(s) to be \n\ntaken on each day of the week. Follow the instructions on the blister card. \n\n \n\nTake Piqray once a day, immediately after food. Taking Piqray at the same time each day will help \n\nyou to remember when to take your medicine. \n\n \n\nHow to take Piqray \n\nPiqray tablets should be swallowed whole, they should not be chewed, crushed or split before \n\nswallowing. You should not swallow any tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged as you \n\nmay not be taking the full dose. \n\n \n\nHow long to take Piqray \n\nTake Piqray for as long as your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nThis is a long-term treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor \n\nyour condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. \n\n \n\nIf you have questions about how long to take Piqray, talk to your doctor or to your pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Piqray than you should \nPeople who have taken too many Piqray tablets have experienced effects that are known side effects of \n\nPiqray, including high blood sugar levels, nausea, tiredness and rash. If you accidentally take too many \n\ntablets, or if someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice \n\nimmediately. Medical treatment may be necessary. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nIf you forget to take Piqray \nIf you forget to take a dose of Piqray, you may still take it, immediately after food, up to 9 hours after \n\nthe time you should have taken it. If you only remember more than 9 hours after you should have \n\ntaken it, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take the dose at your usual time. Do not take a \n\ndouble dose to make up for the one that you missed. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Piqray \nStopping your treatment with Piqray may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop taking \n\nPiqray unless your doctor tells you to stop. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of Piqray, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

medicines called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitors. what piqray is used for piqray is used for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with a type of breast cancer called advanced hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative breast cancer. piqray is used in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal anticancer therapy, in patients whose cancer has not responded to other hormonal treatments and who have certain changes (mutations) in a gene called pik3ca. your doctor will take a sample of your blood and/or tumour tissue, which will be tested for these pik3ca mutations. if the result is positive your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with piqray. how piqray works piqray works by blocking the effects of enzymes called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (pi3k). these enzymes help cancer cells to grow and multiply. by blocking their action, piqray can reduce growth and spread of the cancer and help to destroy cancer cells. if you have any questions about how piqray works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

serious and need treatment. only regular fasting blood tests can tell the doctor if you are developing hyperglycaemia. - your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to test your blood sugar. this will be required more frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment and especially in the first 2 weeks of treatment with piqray. afterwards, blood tests will be needed at least once a month, depending

advice before taking this medicine. women should not breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose of piqray. your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking piqray during pregnancy or breast-feeding. if you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out an existing pregnancy before starting you on treatment with piqray. this may include having a pregnancy test. women who could become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control during treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping piqray. ask your doctor about suitable methods. if you think you may be pregnant after starting treatment with piqray, tell your doctor immediately. during treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment, male patients should
