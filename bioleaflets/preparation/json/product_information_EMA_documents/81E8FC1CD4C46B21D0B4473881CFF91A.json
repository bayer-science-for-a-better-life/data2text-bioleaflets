CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nZonisamide Mylan is indicated as: \n\n• monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults with newly diagnosed epilepsy (see section 5.1); \n\n• adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in \n\nadults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and above. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology - adults \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nDosage escalation and maintenance \n\nZonisamide Mylan may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing therapy in adults. The dose \n\nshould be titrated on the basis of clinical effect. Recommended escalation and maintenance doses are \n\ngiven in Table 1. Some patients, especially those not taking CYP3A4-inducing agents, may respond to \n\nlower doses. \n\n \n\nWithdrawal \n\nWhen Zonisamide Mylan treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually (see section \n\n4.4). In clinical studies of adult patients, dose reductions of 100 mg at weekly intervals have been used \n\nwith concurrent adjustment of other antiepileptic medicine doses (where necessary). \n\n \n\nTable 1.  Adults – recommended dosage escalation and maintenance regimen \n\nTreatment \n\nRegimen \n\nTitration Phase Usual Maintenance \n\nDose \n\nMonotherapy - \n\nNewly diagnosed \n\nadult patients \n\nWeek 1 + 2 Week 3 + 4 Week 5 + 6  \n\n300 mg per day  \n\n(once a day). \n\nIf a higher dose is \n\nrequired: increase at \n\ntwo-weekly intervals in \n\nincrements of 100 mg up \n\nto a maximum of 500 mg. \n\n100 mg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\n200 mg/day  \n\n(once a day) \n\n300 mg/day  \n\n(once a day) \n\nAdjunctive therapy \n\n- with CYP3A4- \n\ninducing agents (see \n\nsection 4.5) \n\nWeek 1 Week 2 Week 3 to 5  \n\n300 to 500 mg per day \n\n(once a day or two divided \n\ndoses). \n\n50 mg/day  \n\n(in two divided \n\ndoses) \n\n100 mg/day \n\n(in two divided \n\ndoses) \n\nIncrease at \n\nweekly intervals \n\nin increments of \n\n100 mg \n\n- without \n\nCYP3A4-inducing \n\nagents; or with renal \n\nor hepatic impairment \n\nWeek 1 + 2 Week 3 + 4 Week 5 to 10  \n\n300 to 500 mg per day \n\n(once a day or two divided \n\ndoses). \n\nSome patients may \n\nrespond to lower doses. \n\n50 mg/day (in \n\ntwo divided \n\ndoses) \n\n100 mg/day (in \n\ntwo divided \n\ndoses) \n\nIncrease at two-\n\nweekly intervals \n\nin increments of \n\nup to 100 mg \n\n \n\nGeneral dosing recommendations for Zonisamide Mylan in special patient populations \n \n\nPaediatric population (aged 6 years and above) \n \n\nDosage escalation and maintenance \n\nZonisamide Mylan must be added to existing therapy for paediatric patients aged 6 years and above. \n\nThe dose should be titrated on the basis of clinical effect. Recommended escalation and maintenance \n\ndoses are given in Table 2. Some patients, especially those not taking CYP3A4-inducing agents, may \n\nrespond to lower doses. \n\n \n\nPhysicians should draw the attention of paediatric patients and their parents/carers to the Patient Alert \n\nBox (in the package leaflet) on preventing heat stroke (see section 4.4: Paediatric Population). \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nTable 2.  Paediatric population (aged 6 years and above) – recommended dosage escalation \nand maintenance regimen \n\nTreatment \n\nRegimen \n\nTitration Phase Usual Maintenance Dose \n\nAdjunctive therapy \n- with CYP3A4- \n\ninducing agents \n\n(see section 4.5) \n\nWeek 1 Weeks 2 to 8 Patients of \n\nweight \n\n20 to 55 kg\na \n\nPatients of \n\nweight > 55 kg \n\n1 mg/kg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\nIncrease at weekly \n\nintervals in \n\nincrements of \n1 mg/kg \n\n6 to 8 mg/kg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\n300 – \n\n500 mg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\n \n \n- without \n\nCYP3A4-inducing \n\nagents \n\nWeek 1 + 2 Weeks ≥ 3 \n \n \n6 to 8 mg/kg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\n \n \n\n300 – \n\n500 mg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\n1 mg/kg/day \n\n(once a day) \n\nIncrease at two-\n\nweekly intervals \n\nin increments of \n1 mg/kg \n\nNote: \n\na. To ensure a therapeutic dose is maintained the weight of a child should be monitored and the dose \n\nreviewed as weight changes occur up to a weight of 55 kg.  The dose regime is 6-8 mg/kg/day up \n\nto a maximum dose of 500 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of zonisamide in children aged below 6 years or those below 20 kg have not yet \n\nbeen established. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from clinical studies in patients with a body weight of less than 20 kg. Therefore \n\nchildren aged 6 years and above and with a body weight less than 20 kg should be treated with caution. \n\n \n\nIt is not always possible to precisely achieve the calculated dose with the commercially available \ncapsule strengths of zonisamide. In these cases it is therefore recommended that the zonisamide total \ndose should be rounded up or down to the nearest available dose that can be achieved with \ncommercially available capsule strengths of zonisamide (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg). \n\n \n\nWithdrawal \n\nWhen zonisamide treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually (see section 4.4). \n\nIn clinical studies of paediatric patients, down-titration was completed by dose reductions at weekly \n\nintervals in increments of about 2 mg/kg (i.e. in accordance with the schedule in Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3.  Paediatric population (aged 6 years and above) – recommended down-titration \n\nschedule \n\nWeight Decrease at weekly intervals in increments of: \n\n20 – 28 kg 25 to 50 mg / day* \n\n29 – 41 kg 50 to 75 mg / day* \n\n42 – 55 kg 100 mg / day* \n\n>55 kg 100 mg / day* \n\nNote: \n\n* All doses are once daily. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nCaution should be exercised at initiation of treatment in elderly patients as there is limited information \n\non the use of zonisamide in these patients. Prescribers should also take account of the safety profile of \n\nzonisamide (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCaution must be exercised in treating patients with renal impairment, as there is limited information on \n\nuse in such patients and a slower titration of Zonisamide Mylan might be required. Since zonisamide \n\nand its metabolites are excreted renally, it should be discontinued in patients who develop acute renal \n\nfailure or where a clinically significant sustained increase in serum creatinine is observed. \n\n \n\nIn subjects with renal impairment, renal clearance of single doses of zonisamide was positively \n\ncorrelated with creatinine clearance. The plasma AUC of zonisamide was increased by 35% in subjects \n\nwith creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Therefore use in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment is not recommended. Caution must be exercised in treating patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment, and a slower titration of Zonisamide Mylan may be required. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nZonisamide Mylan hard capsules are for oral use. \n\n \n\nEffect of food \n\nZonisamide Mylan may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to \n\nsulfonamides. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nUnexplained rash \n\n \n\nSerious rashes occur in association with zonisamide therapy, including cases of \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \n\nConsideration must be given to discontinuing zonisamide in patients who develop an otherwise \n\nunexplained rash. All patients who develop a rash while taking zonisamide must be closely supervised, \n\nwith additional levels of caution applied to those patients receiving concomitant antiepileptic agents \n\nthat may independently induce skin rashes. \n\n \n\nWithdrawal seizures \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, discontinuation of zonisamide in patients with epilepsy \n\nmust be accomplished by gradual dose reduction, to reduce the possibility of seizures on withdrawal. \n\nThere are insufficient data for the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicines once seizure \ncontrol with zonisamide has been achieved in the add-on situation, in order to reach monotherapy with \nzonisamide. Therefore, withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products must be \nundertaken with caution. \n\n \n\nSulfonamide reactions \n\nZonisamide is a benzisoxazole derivative, which contains a sulfonamide group. Serious immune based \n\nadverse reactions that are associated with medicinal products containing a sulfonamide group include \n\nrash, allergic reaction and major haematological disturbances, including aplastic anaemia, which very \n\nrarely can be fatal. Cases of agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, aplastic anaemia, \n\npancytopenia and leucocytosis have been reported. There is inadequate information to assess the \n\nrelationship, if any, between dose and duration of treatment and these events. \n\n \n\nAcute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma \n\nA syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been \nreported in adult and paediatric patients receiving zonisamide. Symptoms include acute onset of \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\ndecreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, anterior \nchamber shallowing, and ocular hyperaemia (redness) and increased intraocular pressure. This \nsyndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens \nand iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms may occur within hours to weeks of \ninitiating therapy. Treatment includes discontinuation of zonisamide, as rapidly as possible in the \njudgment of the treating physician, and appropriate measures to reduce intraocular pressure. Elevated \nintraocular pressure of any aetiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including \npermanent vision loss. Caution should be used when treating patients with history of eye disorders \nwith zonisamide. \n\n \n\nSuicide ideation and behaviour \n\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in \n\nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal \n\nproducts has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of \n\nthis risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for \n\nzonisamide. \n\n \n\nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \n\ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek \n\nmedical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n\n \n\nKidney stones \n\nSome patients, especially those with a predisposition to nephrolithiasis, may be at increased risk for \n\nrenal stone formation and associated signs and symptoms such as renal colic, renal pain or flank pain. \n\nNephrolithiasis may lead to chronic kidney damage. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis include prior stone \n\nformation, a family history of nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria. None of these risk factors can \n\nreliably predict stone formation during zonisamide treatment. In addition, patients taking other \n\nmedications associated with nephrolithiasis may be at increased risk. Increasing fluid intake and urine \n\noutput may help reduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with predisposing risk factors. \n\n \n\nMetabolic acidosis \n\nHyperchloraemic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e. decreased serum bicarbonate below the \n\nnormal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) is associated with zonisamide \n\ntreatment. This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of \n\nzonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Such electrolyte imbalance has been observed with the use of \n\nzonisamide in placebo-controlled clinical trials and in the post-marketing period. Generally, \n\nzonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment although cases can occur at any time \n\nduring treatment. The amounts by which bicarbonate is decreased are usually small – moderate \n\n(average decrease of approximately 3.5 mEq/l at daily doses of 300 mg in adults); rarely patients can \n\nexperience more severe decreases. Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal \n\ndisease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhoea, surgery, ketogenic diet, or medicinal \n\nproducts) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide. \n\n \n\nThe risk of zonisamide induced metabolic acidosis appears to be more frequent and severe in younger \n\npatients. Appropriate evaluation and monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels should be carried out in \n\npatients taking zonisamide who have underlying conditions which might increase the risk of acidosis, \n\nin patients who are at an increased risk of adverse consequences of metabolic acidosis and in patients \n\nwith symptoms suggestive of metabolic acidosis. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, \n\nconsideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing zonisamide (by gradual \n\ndiscontinuation or reduction of a therapeutic dose) as osteopenia may develop. \n\nIf the decision is made to continue patients on zonisamide in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali \n\ntreatment should be considered. \n\n \n\nZonisamide should be used with caution in adult patients being treated concomitantly with carbonic \n\nanhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate or acetazolamide, as there are insufficient data to rule out a \n\npharmacodynamic interaction (see also section 4.4 Paediatric Population and section 4.5). \n\n \n\nHeat stroke \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nCases of decreased sweating and elevated body temperature have been reported mainly in paediatric \n\npatients (see section 4.4 Paediatric Population for full warning). Caution should be used in adults when \n\nzonisamide is prescribed with other medicinal products that predispose patients to heat related \n\ndisorders; these include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and medicinal products with anticholinergic \n\nactivity (see also section 4.4 Paediatric Population).  \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\nIn patients taking zonisamide who develop the clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, it is \n\nrecommended that pancreatic lipase and amylase levels are monitored. If pancreatitis is evident, in the \n\nabsence of another obvious cause, it is recommended that discontinuation of zonisamide be considered \n\nand appropriate treatment initiated. \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis \n\nIn patients taking zonisamide, in whom severe muscle pain and/or weakness develop either in the \n\npresence or absence of a fever, it is recommended that markers of muscle damage be assessed, \n\nincluding serum creatine phosphokinase and aldolase levels. If elevated, in the absence of another \n\nobvious cause such as trauma or grand mal seizures, it is recommended that zonisamide \n\ndiscontinuation be considered and appropriate treatment initiated. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with zonisamide \n\nand for one month after discontinuation (see section 4.6). Zonisamide must not be used in women of \n\nchildbearing potential not using effective contraception unless clearly necessary and only if the \n\npotential benefit is considered to justify the risk to the foetus. Specialist advice should be given to \n\nwomen who are of childbearing potential regarding the possible effects of zonisamide on the foetus \n\nand these risks should be discussed with the patient in relation to the benefits before starting treatment. \n\nWomen planning a pregnancy should meet with their specialists to reassess treatment with zonisamide \n\nand to consider other therapeutic options. Physicians treating patients with zonisamide should ensure \n\nthat patients are fully informed about the need to use appropriate effective contraception and should \n\nuse clinical judgement when assessing whether oral contraceptives (OCs), or the doses of the OC \n\ncomponents, are adequate based on the individual patient’s clinical situation. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nZonisamide may cause weight loss. A dietary supplement or increased food intake may be considered \n\nif the patient is losing weight or is underweight whilst on this medication. If substantial undesirable \n\nweight loss occurs, discontinuation of zonisamide should be considered. Weight loss is potentially \n\nmore serious in children (see section 4.4. Paediatric Population). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe warnings and precautions mentioned above are also applicable to adolescent and paediatric \n\npatients. The warnings and precautions mentioned below are more relevant to paediatric and \n\nadolescent patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nHeat stroke and dehydration \n\nPreventing overheating and dehydration in children \n\n \n\nZonisamide can cause children to sweat less and overheat and if the child is not treated this can \n\nlead to brain damage and death. Children are most at risk especially in hot weather. \n\n \n\nWhen a child is taking zonisamide: \n\n• The child should stay cool especially in hot weather \n\n• The child must avoid heavy exercise especially when the weather is hot \n\n• The child must drink plenty of cold water \n\n• The child must not take any of these medicines: carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like \n\ntopiramate and acetazolamide), and anticholinergic agents (like clomipramine, hydroxyzine, \n\ndiphenhydramine, haloperidol, imipramine and oxybutynin). \n\n \n\nIF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR, THE CHILD NEEDS URGENT MEDICAL \n\nATTENTION: \nThe skin feels very hot with little or no sweating, or the child becomes confused or has muscle \ncramps, or the child’s heartbeat or breathing become rapid. \n\n \n\n• Take the child to a cool, shaded place \n\n• Keep the child's skin cool with water \n\n• Give the child cold water to drink \n\n \n\nCases of decreased sweating and elevated body temperature have been reported mainly in paediatric \n\npatients. Heat stroke requiring hospital treatment was diagnosed in some cases. Heat stroke requiring \n\nhospital treatment and leading to death has been reported. Most reports occurred during periods of \n\nwarm weather. Physicians should discuss with patients and their carers the potential seriousness of heat \n\nstroke, situations in which it might arise, as well as action to take in the event of any signs or \n\nsymptoms. Patients or their carers must be warned to take care to maintain hydration and avoid \n\nexposure to excessive temperatures and strenuous physical exercise depending on the condition of the \n\npatient. Prescribers should draw the attention of paediatric patients and their parent/carers to the advice \n\nin the Packaging Leaflet on preventing heat stroke and overheating in children as provided. In the \n\nevent of signs or symptoms of dehydration, oligohydrosis, or elevated body temperature, \n\ndiscontinuation of zonisamide should be considered. \n\n \n\nZonisamide should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other medicinal products that \n\npredispose patients to heat related disorders; these include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and medicinal \n\nproducts with anticholinergic activity. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nWeight loss leading to deterioration of general condition and failure to take anti-epilepsy medication \n\nhas been related to a fatal outcome (see section 4.8). Zonisamide is not recommended for paediatric \n\npatients who are underweight (definition in accordance with the WHO age adjusted BMI categories) or \n\nhave a decreased appetite. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of decreased body weight is consistent across age groups (see section 4.8); however, \n\ngiven the potential seriousness of weight loss in children, weight should be monitored in this \n\npopulation. A dietary supplement or increased food intake should be considered if the patient is failing \n\nto gain weight in accordance with growth charts, otherwise zonisamide should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from clinical studies in patients with a body weight of less than 20 kg. Therefore \n\nchildren aged 6 years and above with a body weight of less than 20 kg should be treated with caution. \n\nThe long term effect of weight loss in the paediatric population on growth and development is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nMetabolic acidosis \n\nThe risk of zonisamide induced metabolic acidosis appears to be more frequent and severe in paediatric \n\nand adolescent patients. Appropriate evaluation and monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels should be \n\ncarried out in this population (see section 4.4 - Metabolic acidosis for full warning; see section 4.8 for \n\nincidence of low bicarbonate). The long term effect of low bicarbonate levels on growth and \n\ndevelopment is unknown. \n\n \n\nZonisamide should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibitors such as topiramate and acetazolamide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nKidney stones \n\nKidney stones have occurred in paediatric patients (see section 4.4 Kidney stones for full warning). \n\nSome patients, especially those with a predisposition to nephrolithiasis, may be at increased risk for \n\nrenal stone formation and associated signs and symptoms such as renal colic, renal pain or flank pain. \n\nNephrolithiasis may lead to chronic kidney damage. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis include prior stone \n\nformation, a family history of nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria. None of these risk factors can reliably \n\npredict stone formation during zonisamide treatment. Increasing fluid intake and urine output may help \n\nreduce the risk of stone formation, particularly in those with predisposing risk factors. Renal \n\nultrasound should be performed at the discretion of the physician. In the event kidney stones are \n\ndetected, zonisamide should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic dysfunction \n\nIncreased levels of hepatobiliary parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and bilirubin have occurred in paediatric \n\nand adolescent patients, without any consistent pattern in the observations of values above the upper \n\nlimit of normal. Nevertheless, if a hepatic event is suspected, liver function should be evaluated and \n\ndiscontinuation of zonisamide should be considered. \n\n \n\nCognition \n\nCognitive impairment in patients affected by epilepsy has been associated with the underlying \n\npathology and/or the administration of anti-epileptic treatment. In a zonisamide placebo-controlled \n\nstudy conducted in paediatric and adolescent patients, the proportion of patients with impaired \n\ncognition was numerically greater in the zonisamide group compared with the placebo group. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffect of zonisamide on cytochrome P450 enzymes \n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes show no or little (< 25%) inhibition of cytochrome P450 \n\nisozymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4 at zonisamide levels approximately \n\ntwo-fold or greater than clinically relevant unbound serum concentrations. Therefore, zonisamide is \n\nnot expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products via cytochrome P450-mediated \n\nmechanisms, as demonstrated for carbamazepine, phenytoin, ethinylestradiol and desipramine in vivo. \n\n \n\nPotential for zonisamide to affect other medicinal products \n\nAnti-epileptic medicinal products \n\nIn epileptic patients, steady-state dosing with zonisamide resulted in no clinically relevant \n\npharmacokinetic effects on carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or sodium valproate. \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nIn clinical studies in healthy subjects, steady-state dosing with zonisamide did not affect serum \n\nconcentrations of ethinylestradiol or norethisterone in a combined oral contraceptive. \n \nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors \n\nZonisamide should be used with caution in adult patients treated concomitantly with carbonic \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nanhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate and acetazolamide, as there are insufficient data to rule out a \n\npossible pharmacodynamic interaction (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nZonisamide should not be used as co-medication in paediatric patients with other carbonic anhydrase \ninhibitors such as topiramate and acetazolamide (see section 4.4: Paediatric population). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrate \n\nAn in vitro study shows that zonisamide is a weak inhibitor of P-gp (MDR1) with an IC50 of \n\n267 µmol/l and there is the theoretical potential for zonisamide to affect the pharmacokinetics of \n\nsubstances which are P-gp substrates. Caution is advised when starting or stopping zonisamide \n\ntreatment or changing the zonisamide dose in patients who are also receiving medicinal products which \n\nare P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, quinidine). \n\n \n\nPotential medicinal product interactions affecting zonisamide \n\nIn clinical studies co-administration of lamotrigine had no apparent effect on zonisamide \n\npharmacokinetics. The combination of zonisamide with other medicinal products that may lead to \n\nurolithiasis may enhance the risk of developing kidney stones; therefore the concomitant \n\nadministration of such medicinal products should be avoided. \n\n \n\nZonisamide is metabolised partly by CYP3A4 (reductive cleavage), and also by N-acetyl-transferases \n\nand conjugation with glucuronic acid; therefore, substances that can induce or inhibit these enzymes \n\nmay affect the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide: \n\n \n\n- Enzyme induction: Exposure to zonisamide is lower in epileptic patients receiving \n\nCYP3A4-inducing agents such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbitone. These \n\neffects are unlikely to be of clinical significance when zonisamide is added to existing therapy; \n\nhowever, changes in zonisamide concentrations may occur if concomitant CYP3A4-inducing \n\nanti-epileptic or other medicinal products are withdrawn, dose adjusted or introduced, an \n\nadjustment of the zonisamide dose may be required. Rifampicin is a potent CYP3A4 inducer. \n\nIf co-administration is necessary, the patient should be closely monitored and the dose of \n\nzonisamide and other CYP3A4 substrates adjusted as needed. \n\n \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibition: Based upon clinical data, known specific and non-specific CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors appear to have no clinically relevant effect on zonisamide pharmacokinetic exposure \n\nparameters. Steady-state dosing of either ketoconazole (400 mg/day) or cimetidine \n\n(1200 mg/day) had no clinically relevant effects on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of \n\nzonisamide given to healthy subjects. Therefore, modification of zonisamide dosing should not \n\nbe necessary when co-administered with known CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with zonisamide, \n\nand for one month after discontinuation. \n\n \n\nZonisamide must not be used in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception \n\nunless clearly necessary and only if the potential benefit is considered to justify the risk to the foetus.  \n\n \n\nSpecialist advice should be given to women treated with zonisamide who are of childbearing potential. \n\nWomen planning a pregnancy should meet with their specialists to reassess treatment with zonisamide \n\nand to consider other therapeutic options. As with all antiepileptic medicines, sudden discontinuation \n\nof zonisamide should be avoided as this may lead to breakthrough seizures that could have serious \n\nconsequences for the woman and the unborn child. The risk of birth defect is increased by factor 2 to 3 \n\nin the offspring of mothers treated with an antiepileptic medicinal product. The most frequently \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nreported are cleft lip, cardiovascular malformations and neural tube defect. Multiple antiepileptic \n\nmedicinal product therapy may be associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are limited data from the use of zonisamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nData from a registry study suggest an increase in the proportion of babies born at a low birth weight \n\n(LBW), pre-term or small for gestational age (SGA). These increases are from about 5% to 8% for \n\nLBW, from about 8% to 10% for pre-term birth and from about 7% to 12% for SGA, all compared with \n\nmothers treated with lamotrigine monotherapy. \n\n \n\nZonisamide must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and only if the potential benefit \nis considered to justify the risk to the foetus. If zonisamide is prescribed during pregnancy, patients \nshould be fully informed of the potential harm to the foetus and use of the minimal effective dose is \nadvised along with careful monitoring. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nZonisamide is excreted in human milk; the concentration in breast milk is similar to maternal plasma. \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nzonisamide therapy. Due to the long retention time of zonisamide in the body, breast-feeding must not \n\nbe resumed until one month after zonisamide therapy is completed. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data available on the effects of zonisamide on human fertility. Studies in animals \nhave shown changes in fertility parameters (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\ngiven that some patients may experience drowsiness or difficulty with concentration, particularly early \n\nin treatment or after a dose increase, patients must be advised to exercise caution during activities \n\nrequiring a high degree of alertness, e.g., driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nZonisamide has been administered to over 1,200 patients in clinical studies, more than 400 of whom \n\nreceived zonisamide for at least 1 year.  In addition there has been extensive post-marketing experience \n\nwith zonisamide in Japan since 1989 and in the USA since 2000. \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that zonisamide is a benzisoxazole derivative, which contains a sulfonamide group. \n\nSerious immune based adverse reactions that are associated with medicinal products containing a \n\nsulfonamide group include rash, allergic reaction and major haematological disturbances including \n\naplastic anaemia, which very rarely can be fatal (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions in controlled adjunctive-therapy studies were somnolence, \n\ndizziness and anorexia. The most common adverse reactions in a randomised, controlled monotherapy \n\ntrial comparing zonisamide with carbamazepine prolonged release were decreased bicarbonate, \n\ndecreased appetite, and decreased weight. The incidence of markedly abnormally low serum \n\nbicarbonate (a decrease to less than 17 mEq/l and by more than 5 mEq/l) was 3.8%. The incidence of \n\nmarked decreases in weight of 20% or more was 0.7%. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions associated with zonisamide obtained from clinical studies and post-marketing \n\nsurveillance are tabulated below. The frequencies are arranged according to the following scheme: \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\nvery common ≥ 1/10 \n\ncommon ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \n\nuncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n\nrare ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \n\nvery rare < 1/10,000 \n\nnot known cannot be estimated from the available data \n \n\nTable 4.

Among 465 subjects in the paediatric safety database \n\n(including a further 67 subjects from the extension phase of the controlled clinical trial) there were \n\n7 deaths (1.5%; 14.6/1000 person-years): 2 cases of status epilepticus, of which one was related to \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nsevere weight loss (10% within 3 months) in an underweight subject and subsequent failure to take \n\nmedication; 1 case of head injury/haematoma, and 4 deaths in subjects with pre-existing functional \n\nneurological deficits for various causes (2 cases of pneumonia-induced sepsis/organ failure, 1 SUDEP \n\nand 1 head injury). A total of 70.4% of paediatric subjects who received ZNS in the controlled study or \n\nits open label extension had at least one treatment-emergent bicarbonate measurement below \n\n22 mmol/L. The duration of low bicarbonate measurements was also long (median 188 days). \n\nA pooled analysis of safety data on 420 paediatric subjects (183 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and \n\n237 subjects aged 12 to 16 years with a mean duration of exposure of approximately 12 months) has \n\nshown a relatively higher reporting frequency of pneumonia, dehydration, decreased sweating, \n\nabnormal liver function tests, otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection, \n\ncough, epistaxis and rhinitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, rash and eczema, and fever compared to the \n\nadult population (particularly in subjects aged below 12 years) and, at a low incidence, amnesia, \n\ncreatinine increased, lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The incidence of a decrease in body \n\nweight of 10% or more was 10.7% (see section 4.4). In some cases of weight decrease there was a \n\ndelay in transition to the next Tanner stage and in bone maturation. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere have been cases of accidental and intentional overdose in adult and paediatric patients. In some \n\ncases, the overdoses were asymptomatic, particularly where emesis or lavage was prompt. In other \n\ncases, the overdose was followed by symptoms such as somnolence, nausea, gastritis, nystagmus, \n\nmyoclonus, coma, bradycardia, reduced renal function, hypotension and respiratory depression. A very \n\nhigh plasma concentration of 100.1 μg/ml zonisamide was recorded approximately 31 hours after a \n\npatient took an overdose of zonisamide and clonazepam; the patient became comatose and had \n\nrespiratory depression, but recovered consciousness five days later and had no sequelae. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nNo specific antidotes for zonisamide overdose are available. Following a suspected recent overdose, \n\nemptying the stomach by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis may be indicated with the usual \n\nprecautions to protect the airway. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring \n\nof vital signs and close observation. Zonisamide has a long elimination half-life so its effects may be \n\npersistent. Although not formally studied for the treatment of overdose, haemodialysis reduced plasma \n\nconcentrations of zonisamide in a patient with reduced renal function, and may be considered as \n\ntreatment of overdose if clinically indicated. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX15 \n\n \n\nZonisamide is a benzisoxazole derivative. It is an anti-epileptic medicine with weak carbonic \n\nanhydrase activity in-vitro. It is chemically unrelated to other anti-epileptic agents. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe mechanism of action of zonisamide is not fully elucidated, but it appears to act on \n\nvoltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels, thereby disrupting synchronised neuronal firing, \n\nreducing the spread of seizure discharges and disrupting subsequent epileptic activity. Zonisamide also \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n \n\nhas a modulatory effect on GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nThe anticonvulsant activity of zonisamide has been evaluated in a variety of models, in several species \n\nwith induced or innate seizures, and zonisamide appears to act as a broad-spectrum anti-epileptic in \n\nthese models. Zonisamide prevents maximal electroshock seizures and restricts seizure spread, \n\nincluding the propagation of seizures from cortex to sub-cortical structures and suppresses \n\nepileptogenic focus activity. Unlike phenytoin and carbamazepine however, zonisamide acts \n\npreferentially on seizures originating in the cortex. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nMonotherapy in partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation \n\nEfficacy of zonisamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, \n\nnon-inferiority comparison to carbamazepine prolonged release (PR) in 583 adult subjects with newly \n\ndiagnosed partial seizures with or without secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Subjects were \n\nrandomised to carbamazepine and zonisamide received treatment for a duration of up to 24 months \n\ndepending on response. Subjects were titrated to the initial target dose of 600 mg carbamazepine or \n\n300 mg of zonisamide. Subjects who experienced a seizure were titrated to the next target dose i.e. \n\n800 mg carbamazepine or 400 mg of zonisamide. Subjects who experienced a further seizure were \n\ntitrated to the maximal target dose of 1200 mg carbamazepine or 500 mg zonisamide. Subjects who \n\nwere seizure-free for 26 weeks at a target dose level continued on this dose for another 26 weeks. Main \n\noutcomes of this study are presented in this table: \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.

A 50% or greater reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the 12-week \n\nstable dose period was seen in 50% of the zonisamide-treated subjects and 31% of the patients on \n\nplacebo. \n\n \n\nSpecific safety issues that were encountered in the paediatric studies were: decreased appetite and \n\nweight loss, decreased bicarbonate levels, increased risk of kidney stones and dehydration. All these \n\neffects and specifically weight loss may have deleterious implications for growth and development, \n\nand may lead to general deterioration of health. Altogether, data on effects on long-term growth and \n\ndevelopment are limited. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\nZonisamide is almost completely absorbed after oral administration, generally reaching peak serum or \n\nplasma concentrations within 2 to 5 hours of dosing. The first-pass metabolism is believed to be \n\nnegligible. Absolute bioavailability is estimated to be approximately 100%. Oral bioavailability is not \n\naffected by food, although peak plasma and serum concentrations may be delayed. \n\n \n\nZonisamide AUC and Cmax values increased almost linearly after single dose over the dose range of \n\n100-800 mg and after multiple doses over the dose range of 100-400 mg once daily. The increase at \n\nsteady state was slightly more than expected on the basis of dose, probably due to the saturable binding \n\nof zonisamide to erythrocytes. Steady state was achieved within 13 days. Slightly greater than \n\nexpected accumulation occurs relative to single dosing. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nZonisamide is 40 – 50 % bound to human plasma proteins, with in vitro studies showing that this is \n\nunaffected by the presence of various antiepileptic medicinal products (i.e., phenytoin, phenobarbitone, \n\ncarbamazepine, and sodium valproate). The apparent volume of distribution is about 1.1 – 1.7 l/kg in \n\nadults indicating that zonisamide is extensively distributed to tissues. Erythrocyte/plasma ratios are \n\nabout 15 at low concentrations and about 3 at higher concentrations. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nZonisamide is metabolised primarily through reductive cleavage of the benzisoxazole ring of the parent \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\ndrug by CYP3A4 to form 2-sulfamoylacetylphenol (SMAP) and also by N-acetylation. Parent drug and \n\nSMAP can additionally be glucuronidated. The metabolites, which could not be detected in plasma, are \n\ndevoid of anticonvulsant activity. There is no evidence that zonisamide induces its own metabolism. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nApparent clearance of zonisamide at steady-state after oral administration is about 0.70 l/h and the \n\nterminal elimination half-life is about 60 hours in the absence of CYP3A4 inducers. The elimination \n\nhalf-life was independent of dose and not affected by repeat administration. Fluctuation in serum or \n\nplasma concentrations over a dosing interval is low (< 30%). The main route of excretion of \n\nzonisamide metabolites and unchanged drug is via the urine. Renal clearance of unchanged zonisamide \n\nis relatively low (approximately 3.5 ml/min); about 15 - 30 % of the dose is eliminated unchanged. \n\n \n\nLinearity / non-linearity \n\nZonisamide exposure increases with time until steady state is achieved by approximately 8 weeks. \n\nWhen comparing the same dose level, subjects of higher total body weight appear to have lower \n\nsteady-state serum concentrations, but this effect appears to be relatively modest.  Age (≥ 12 years) \n\nand gender, after adjustment for body weight effects, have no apparent effect on zonisamide \n\nexposure in epileptic patients during steady-state dosing.  There is no need for dose adjustment with \n\nany of the AEDs including CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n\nZonisamide lowers the 28-day average seizure frequency and the decrease is proportional (log-linear) \n\nto zonisamide average concentration. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal clearance of single doses of zonisamide was positively correlated with creatinine clearance. The \n\nplasma AUC of zonisamide was increased by 35% in subjects with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min (see \n\nalso section 4.2.). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of zonisamide in patients with impaired liver function have not been adequately \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics between young (aged \n\n21-40 years) and elderly (65-75 years). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (5-18 years) \n\nLimited data indicate that pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents dosed to steady state at 1, 7 or \n\n12 mg/kg daily, in divided doses, are similar to those observed in adults, after adjustment for \n\nbodyweight. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nFindings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the dog at exposure levels similar to clinical use, \n\nwere liver changes (enlargement, dark-brown discolouration, mild hepatocyte enlargement with \n\nconcentric lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic vacuolation) associated with increased \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nZonisamide was not genotoxic and has no carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nZonisamide caused developmental abnormalities in mice, rats, and dogs, and was embryolethal in \n\nmonkeys, when administered during the period of organogenesis at zonisamide dosage and maternal \n\nplasma levels similar to or lower than therapeutic levels in humans. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nIn a repeated-dose oral toxicity study in juvenile rats, at exposure levels similar to those observed in \n\npaediatric patients at the maximum recommended dose, decreases in body weight and changes in renal \n\nhistopathology and clinical pathology parameters and behavioural changes were observed.  Changes in \n\nrenal histopathology and clinical pathology parameters were considered to be related to carbonic \n\nanhydrase inhibition by zonisamide.  The effects at this dose level were reversible during the recovery \n\nperiod. At a higher dose level (2-3-fold systemic exposure compared to therapeutic exposure) renal \n\nhistopathological effects were more severe and only partially reversible. Most adverse effects observed \n\nin the juvenile rats were similar to those seen in the repeated-dose toxicity studies of zonisamide in \n\nadult rats, but renal tubular hyaline droplets and transitional hyperplasia were observed in the juvenile \n\nstudy only.  At this higher dose level, juvenile rats showed a decrease in growth, learning, and \n\ndevelopmental parameters.  These effects were considered likely related to the decreased body weight \n\nand exaggerated pharmacologic effects of zonisamide at the maximum tolerated dose. \n\n \n\nIn rats, decreased numbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites were observed at exposure levels \n\nequivalent to the maximum therapeutic dose in humans; irregular oestrus cycles and a decreased \n\nnumber of live foetuses were observed at exposure levels three times higher. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Zonisamide Mylan is and what it is used for \n\nZonisamide Mylan contains the active substance zonisamide, and is used as an antiepileptic medicine. \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan is used to treat seizures that affect one part of the brain (partial seizure), which may \n\nor may not be followed by a seizure affecting all of the brain (secondary generalisation). \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan may be used: \n\n• on its own to treat seizures in adults \n\n• with other antiepileptic medicines to treat seizures in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years \n\nand above. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Zonisamide Mylan \n\n \n\nDo not take Zonisamide Mylan \n\n- if you are allergic to zonisamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- if you are allergic to other sulfonamide medicines. Examples include: sulfonamide \n\nantibiotics, thiazide diuretics, and sulfonylurea antidiabetes medicines. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nZonisamide Mylan belongs to a group of medicines (sulfonamides) which can cause severe allergic \n\nreactions, severe skin rashes, and blood disorders, which very rarely can be fatal (see section 4. Possible \n\nSide Effects). \n\n \n\nA small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as zonisamide have had thoughts of \n\nharming or killing themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, immediately contact your doctor. \n\n \n\nSerious rashes occur in association with zonisamide therapy, including cases of Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zonisamide Mylan if you: \n\n- are younger than 12 years old, as you may be at greater risk of decreased sweating, heat stroke, \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\npneumonia and liver problems.  If you are younger than 6 years old, Zonisamide Mylan is not \n\nrecommended for you \n\n- are elderly, as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting, and you may be more likely to \n\ndevelop an allergic reaction, severe skin rash, swelling of the feet and legs, and itchiness when \n\ntaking Zonisamide Mylan (see section 4 Possible Side Effects) \n\n- suffer from liver problems, as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting \n\n- have eye problems such as glaucoma \n\n- suffer from kidney problems as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting \n\n- have previously suffered from kidney stones, as you may be at increased risk of developing more \n\nkidney stones. Reduce the risk of kidney stones by drinking sufficient water \n\n- live in a place or are on holiday in a place where the weather is warm. Zonisamide Mylan can make \n\nyou perspire less, which can cause your body temperature to increase. Reduce the risk of \n\noverheating by drinking sufficient water and keeping cool \n\n- are underweight, or have lost a lot of weight as Zonisamide Mylan can cause you to lose more \n\nweight. Tell your doctor as this may need to be monitored. \n\n- are pregnant or could become pregnant (see section ‘pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility’ for \n\nfurther information). \n\n \n\nIf any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before you take Zonisamide Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTalk to your doctor about the following risks:  \n\n \n\nPreventing overheating and dehydration in children \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan can cause your child to sweat less and overheat and if your child is not treated this \n\ncan lead to brain damage and death. Children are most at risk especially in hot weather. \n\n \n\nWhen your child is taking Zonisamide Mylan: \n\n- keep your child cool especially in hot weather \n\n- your child must avoid heavy exercise especially when the weather is hot \n\n- give your child plenty of cold water to drink \n\n- your child must not take these medicines: \n\ncarbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like topiramate and acetazolamide), and anticholinergic agents (like \n\nclomipramine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, haloperidol, imipramine and oxybutynin). \n\n \n\nIf your child’s skin feels very hot with little or no sweating, becomes confused, has muscle cramps, or \n\nyour child’s heartbeat or breathing becomes rapid: \n\n- take your child to a cool, shaded place \n\n- sponge your child’s skin with cool (not cold) water \n\n- give your child cold water to drink \n\n- seek urgent medical assistance. \n\n \n\n \n\n• Body weight: You should monitor your child’s weight every month and see your doctor as soon as \n\npossible if your child is not gaining enough weight.  Zonisamide Mylan is not recommended for \n\nchildren who are underweight or have a small appetite, and should be used with caution in those \n\nbelow 20 kg. \n\n• Increased acid level in the blood and kidney stones: Reduce these risks by ensuring that your child \n\ndrinks enough water and is not taking any other medicine which could cause kidney stones (see \n\nOther medicines).  Your doctor will monitor your child’s blood bicarbonate levels and kidneys \n\n(see also section 4). \n\n \n\nDo not give this medicine to children below the age of 6 years because it is not known for this age \n\ngroup whether the potential benefits are greater than the risks. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Zonisamide Mylan \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n- Zonisamide Mylan should be used carefully in adults when taken with medicines that can cause \n\nkidney stones, like topiramate or acetazolamide. In children, this combination is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n- Zonisamide Mylan could possibly increase your blood levels of medicines like digoxin and \n\nquinidine, and so a reduction in their dose may be required. \n\n- Other medicines like phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone and rifampicin can decrease your \n\nblood levels of Zonisamide Mylan, which may require an adjustment of your dose of Zonisamide \n\nMylan. \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan with food and drink \n\nZonisamide Mylan can be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are a woman of childbearing age you must use adequate contraception while taking, and for one \n\nmonth after stopping, Zonisamide Mylan. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. You should not stop your treatment without discussing this \n\nwith your doctor. \n\n \n\nYou must only take Zonisamide Mylan during your pregnancy if your doctor tells you to. Research has \n\nshown an increased risk of birth defects in children of women taking anti-epileptic medicines. \n\nA study showed that babies born to mothers using zonisamide during pregnancy were smaller than \n\nexpected for their age at birth, compared with babies born to mothers treated with lamotrigine \n\nmonotherapy. Make sure you are fully informed about the risks and the benefits of using zonisamide for \n\nepilepsy during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nDo not breast-feed whilst taking, or for one month after stopping Zonisamide Mylan. \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data available on the effects of zonisamide on human fertility. Studies in animals \n\nhave shown changes in fertility parameters. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nZonisamide Mylan may affect your concentration, ability to react/respond, and may make you feel sleepy, \n\nparticularly at the beginning of your treatment or after your dose is increased. Be especially careful while \n\ndriving or operating machinery if Zonisamide Mylan affects you in this way. \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n3. How to take Zonisamide Mylan \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended adult dose \n\n \n\nWhen you take Zonisamide Mylan on its own: \n\n- The starting dose is 100 mg taken once a day. \n\n- This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of two weeks. \n\n- The recommended dose is 300 mg once a day. \n\n \n\nWhen you take Zonisamide Mylan with other antiepileptic medicines: \n\n- The starting dose is 50 mg daily taken in two equal doses of 25 mg. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n- This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of one to two weeks. \n\n- The recommended daily dose is between 300 mg and 500 mg. \n\n- Some people respond to lower doses. The dose may be increased more slowly if you experience \n\nside effects, are elderly or if you suffer from kidney or liver problems.  \n\n \n\nUse in children (aged 6 to 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) weighing at least \n\n20 kg: \n\n- The starting dose is 1 mg per kg of body weight taken once a day. \n\n- This may be increased by 1 mg per kg of body weight at intervals of one to two weeks. \n\n- The recommended daily dose is 6 to 8 mg per kg for a child with a body weight of up to 55 kg or \n\n300 to 500 mg for a child with a body weight more than 55 kg (which ever dose is lower) taken \n\nonce a day. \n\n \n\nExample: A child who weighs 25 kg should take 25 mg once a day for the first week, and then increase \n\nthe daily dose by 25 mg at the start of each week until a daily dose between 150 to 200 mg is reached. \n\n \n\nIf you feel that the effect of Zonisamide Mylan is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\n- Zonisamide Mylan capsules must be swallowed whole with water. \n\n- Do not chew the capsules. \n\n- Zonisamide Mylan can be taken once or twice daily, as instructed by your doctor. \n\n- If you take Zonisamide Mylan twice a day, take half the daily dose in the morning and half in the \n\nevening. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Zonisamide Mylan than you should \n\nIf you may have taken more Zonisamide Mylan than you should, tell a carer (relative or friend), your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist immediately, or contact your nearest hospital casualty department, taking your \n\nmedicine with you.  You may become sleepy and could lose consciousness. You might also feel sick, \n\nhave a sore stomach, muscle twitches, eye movement, feel faint, have a slowed heartbeat, and reduced \n\nbreathing and kidney function.  Do not try to drive. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Zonisamide Mylan \n\n- If you forget to take a dose, don’t worry: take the next dose when it is due. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Zonisamide Mylan \n\n- Zonisamide Mylan is meant to be taken as a long-term medicine. Do not reduce your dose or \n\nstop your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n- If your doctor advises you to stop taking Zonisamide Mylan your dose will be reduced gradually \n\nto lower the risk of more seizures. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nZonisamide Mylan belongs to a group of medicines (sulfonamides) that can cause severe allergic \n\nreactions, severe skin rashes, and blood disorders, which very rarely can be fatal. \n\n \n\nContact your doctor immediately if you: \n\n- have difficulty breathing, a swollen face, lips or tongue, or a severe skin rash as these symptoms \n\nmay indicate that you are having a severe allergic reaction \n\n- have signs of overheating - high body temperature but little or no sweating, rapid heartbeat and \n\nbreathing, muscle cramps, and confusion \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n- have thoughts of harming or killing yourself.
