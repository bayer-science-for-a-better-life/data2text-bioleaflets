CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOfev is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n\nOfev is also indicated in adults for the treatment of other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases \n(ILDs) with a progressive phenotype (see section 5.1).\n\nOfev is indicated in adults for the treatment of systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease \n(SSc-ILD).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of diseases for which \nOfev is approved.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is 150 mg nintedanib twice daily administered approximately 12 hours apart.\nThe 100 mg twice daily dose is only recommended to be used in patients who do not tolerate the \n150 mg twice daily dose.\n\n\n\n3\n\nIf a dose is missed, administration should resume at the next scheduled time at the recommended dose.\nIf a dose is missed the patient should not take an additional dose. The recommended maximum daily \ndose of 300 mg should not be exceeded.\n\nDose adjustments\nIn addition to symptomatic treatment if applicable, the management of adverse reactions to Ofev (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8) could include dose reduction and temporary interruption until the specific \nadverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow continuation of therapy. Ofev treatment may be \nresumed at the full dose (150 mg twice daily) or a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily). If a patient does \nnot tolerate 100 mg twice daily, treatment with Ofev should be discontinued.\n\nIf diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting persist despite appropriate supportive care (including anti-emetic \ntherapy), dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required. The treatment may be resumed at a \nreduced dose (100 mg twice daily) or at the full dose (150 mg twice daily). In case of persisting severe \ndiarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting despite symptomatic treatment, therapy with Ofev should be \ndiscontinued (see section 4.4).\n\nIn case of interruptions due to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nelevations > 3x upper limit of normal (ULN), once transaminases have returned to baseline values,\ntreatment with Ofev may be reintroduced at a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily) which subsequently \nmay be increased to the full dose (150 mg twice daily) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years)\nNo overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed for elderly patients. No a-priori dose \nadjustment is required on the basis of a patient\u2019s age. Patients \u226575 years may be more likely to require \ndose reduction to manage adverse effects (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nAdjustment of the starting dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required. \nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been studied in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (<30 ml/min creatinine clearance).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), the recommended dose of Ofev is 100 mg \ntwice daily approximately 12 hours apart. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), \ntreatment interruption or discontinuation for management of adverse reactions should be considered.\nThe safety and efficacy of nintedanib have not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment \nclassified as Child Pugh B and C. Treatment of patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe \n(Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment with Ofev is not recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Ofev in children aged 0-18 years have not been established. No data are \navailable.\n\nMethod of administration \nOfev is for oral use. The capsules should be taken with food, swallowed whole with water, and should \nnot be chewed or crushed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Pregnancy (see section 4.6)\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to nintedanib, to peanut or soya, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nDiarrhoea\nIn the clinical trials (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was the most frequent gastro-intestinal adverse \nreaction reported (see section 4.8). In most patients, the adverse reaction was of mild to moderate \nintensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment.\n\nSerious cases of diarrhoea leading to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances have been reported in \nthe post-marketing. Patients should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and anti-diarrhoeal \nmedicinal products, e.g. loperamide, and may require dose reduction or treatment interruption. Ofev\ntreatment may be resumed at a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily) or at the full dose (150 mg twice \ndaily). In case of persisting severe diarrhoea despite symptomatic treatment, therapy with Ofev should \nbe discontinued.\n\nNausea and vomiting\nNausea and vomiting were frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section 4.8). In \nmost patients with nausea and vomiting, the event was of mild to moderate intensity. In clinical trials, \nnausea led to discontinuation of Ofev in up to 2.1% of patients and vomiting led to discontinuation of \nOfev in up to 1.4% of patients.\n\nIf symptoms persist despite appropriate supportive care (including anti-emetic therapy), dose reduction \nor treatment interruption may be required. The treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose (100 mg \ntwice daily) or at the full dose (150 mg twice daily). In case of persisting severe symptoms therapy \nwith Ofev should be discontinued.\n\nHepatic function \nThe safety and efficacy of Ofev has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or \nsevere (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Therefore, treatment with Ofev is not recommended in \nsuch patients (see section 4.2). Based on increased exposure, the risk for adverse reactions may be \nincreased in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A). Patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child Pugh A) should be treated with a reduced dose of Ofev (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nCases of drug-induced liver injury have been observed with nintedanib treatment, including severe \nliver injury with fatal outcome. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of \ntreatment. Therefore, hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels should be investigated before treatment\ninitiation and during the first month of treatment with Ofev. Patients should then be monitored at \nregular intervals during the subsequent two months of treatment and periodically thereafter, e.g. at \neach patient visit or as clinically indicated.\n\nElevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, blood alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), gamma-glutamyl-\ntransferase (GGT), see section 4.8) and bilirubin were reversible upon dose reduction or interruption in \nthe majority of cases. If transaminase (AST or ALT) elevations > 3x ULN are measured, dose \nreduction or interruption of the therapy with Ofev is recommended and the patient should be \nmonitored closely. Once transaminases have returned to baseline values, treatment with Ofev may be \nresumed at the full dose (150 mg twice daily) or reintroduced at a reduced dose (100 mg twice daily) \nwhich subsequently may be increased to the full dose (see section 4.2). If any liver test elevations are \nassociated with clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury, e.g. jaundice, treatment with Ofev should be \npermanently discontinued. Alternative causes of the liver enzyme elevations should be investigated. \n\nPatients with low body weight (< 65 kg), Asian and female patients have a higher risk of elevations of \nliver enzymes. Nintedanib exposure increased linearly with patient age, which may also result in a \nhigher risk of developing liver enzyme elevations (see section 5.2). Close monitoring is recommended \nin patients with these risk factors.\n\n\n\n5\n\nRenal function\nCases of renal impairment/failure, in some cases with fatal outcome, have been reported with \nnintedanib use (see section 4.8).\nPatients should be monitored during nintedanib therapy, with particular attention to those patients \nexhibiting risk factors for renal impairment/failure. In case of renal impairment/failure, therapy \nadjustment should be considered (see section 4.2 Dose adjustments).\n\nHaemorrhage\nVascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition might be associated with an increased \nrisk of bleeding.\nPatients at known risk for bleeding including patients with inherited predisposition to bleeding or \npatients receiving a full dose of anticoagulative treatment were not included in the clinical trials. Non-\nserious and serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported in the post-\nmarketing period (including patients with or without anticoagulant therapy or other medicinal products\nthat could cause bleeding). Therefore, these patients should only be treated with Ofev if the anticipated \nbenefit outweighs the potential risk.\n\nArterial thromboembolic events\nPatients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from the clinical trials.\nIn the clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events were infrequently reported (Ofev 2.5% versus \nplacebo 0.7% for INPULSIS; Ofev 0.9% versus placebo 0.9% for INBUILD; Ofev 0.7% versus \nplacebo 0.7% for SENSCIS). In the INPULSIS trials, a higher percentage of patients experienced \nmyocardial infarctions in the Ofev group (1.6%) compared to the placebo group (0.5%), while adverse \nevents reflecting ischaemic heart disease were balanced between the Ofev and placebo groups. In the \nINBUILD trial, myocardial infarction was observed with low frequency: Ofev 0.9% versus placebo \n0.9%. In the SENSCIS trial, myocardial infarction was observed with low frequency in the placebo \ngroup (0.7%) and not observed in the Ofev group. Caution should be used when treating patients at \nhigher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. Treatment interruption should be \nconsidered in patients who develop signs or symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia.\n\nAneurysms and artery dissections\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Ofev, this risk should be carefully \nconsidered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\nIn the clinical trials, no increased risk of venous thromboembolism was observed in nintedanib treated \npatients. Due to the mechanism of action of nintedanib patients might have an increased risk of \nthromboembolic events.\n\nGastrointestinal perforations and ischaemic colitis\nIn the clinical trials, the frequency of patients with perforation was up to 0.3% in both treatment \ngroups. Due to the mechanism of action of nintedanib, patients might have an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal perforations. Cases of gastrointestinal perforations and cases of ischaemic colitis, \nsome of which were fatal, have been reported in the post-marketing period. Particular caution should \nbe exercised when treating patients with previous abdominal surgery, previous history of peptic \nulceration, diverticular disease or receiving concomitant corticosteroids or NSAIDs. Ofev should only \nbe initiated at least 4 weeks after abdominal surgery. Therapy with Ofev should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or ischaemic colitis. Exceptionally, \nOfev can be reintroduced after complete resolution of ischaemic colitis and careful assessment of \npatient\u2019s condition and other risk factors.\n\nHypertension\nAdministration of Ofev may increase blood pressure. Systemic blood pressure should be measured \nperiodically and as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPulmonary hypertension\nData on the use of Ofev in patients with pulmonary hypertension is limited.\nPatients with significant pulmonary hypertension (cardiac index \u2264 2 L/min/m\u00b2, or parenteral \nepoprostenol/treprostinil, or significant right heart failure) were excluded from the INBUILD and \nSENSCIS trials.\nOfev should not be used in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring is \nrecommended in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.\n\nWound healing complication\nNo increased frequency of impaired wound healing was observed in the clinical trials. Based on the \nmechanism of action nintedanib may impair wound healing. No dedicated studies investigating the \neffect of nintedanib on wound healing were performed. Treatment with Ofev should therefore only be \ninitiated or - in case of perioperative interruption - resumed based on clinical judgement of adequate \nwound healing.\n\nCo-administration with pirfenidone\nIn a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of nintedanib with pirfenidone was \ninvestigated in patients with IPF. Based on these results, there is no evidence of a relevant \npharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nintedanib and pirfenidone when administered in \ncombination (see section 5.2). Given the similarity in safety profiles for both medicinal products, \nadditive adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse events, may be expected.\nThe benefit-risk balance of concomitant treatment with pirfenidone has not been established.\n\nEffect on QT interval\nNo evidence of QT prolongation was observed for nintedanib in the clinical trial programme \n(Section 5.1). As some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to exert an effect on QT, caution \nshould be exercised when nintedanib is administered in patients who may develop QTc prolongation.\n\nAllergic reaction\nDietary soya products are known to cause allergic reactions including severe anaphylaxis in persons \nwith soya allergy. Patients with known allergy to peanut protein carry an enhanced risk for severe \nreactions to soya preparations.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp)\nNintedanib is a substrate of P-gp (see section 5.2). Co-administration with the potent P-gp inhibitor \nketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold based on AUC and 1.83-fold based on Cmax in \na dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction study with the potent P-gp inducer \nrifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based on AUC and to 60.3% based on Cmax\n\nupon co-administration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. If co-\nadministered with Ofev, potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin or cyclosporine) may \nincrease exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of \nnintedanib. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or \ndiscontinuation of therapy with Ofev (see section 4.2).\n\nPotent P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John\u2019s Wort) may decrease \nexposure to nintedanib. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal P-\ngp induction potential should be considered.\n\nCytochrome (CYP)-enzymes\nOnly a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways. Nintedanib \nand its metabolites, the free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide, did \nnot inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). The likelihood of drug-drug \ninteractions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low.\n\n\n\n7\n\nCo-administration with other medicinal products\nCo-administration of nintedanib with oral hormonal contraceptives did not alter the pharmacokinetics \nof oral hormonal contraceptives to a relevant extent (see section 5.2).\n\nCo-administration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib (see \nsection 5.2).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception\nNintedanib may cause foetal harm in humans (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential \nshould be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Ofev and to use highly \neffective contraceptive methods at initiation of, during and at least 3 months after the last dose of \nOfev. Nintedanib does not relevantly affect the plasma exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel \n(see section 5.2). The efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives may be compromised by vomiting \nand/or diarrhoea or other conditions where the absorption may be affected. Women taking oral \nhormonal contraceptives experiencing these conditions should be advised to use an alternative highly \neffective contraceptive measure.\n\nPregnancy\nThere is no information on the use of Ofev in pregnant women, but pre-clinical studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity of this active substance (see section 5.3). As nintedanib may cause foetal \nharm also in humans, it must not be used during pregnancy (see section 4.3) and pregnancy testing \nmust be conducted prior to treatment with Ofev and during treatment as appropriate.\n\nFemale patients should be advised to notify their doctor or pharmacist if they become pregnant during \ntherapy with Ofev.\n\nIf the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Ofev, treatment must be discontinued and she should \nbe apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nThere is no information on the excretion of nintedanib and its metabolites in human milk.\nPre-clinical studies showed that small amounts of nintedanib and its metabolites (\u2264 0.5% of the \nadministered dose) were secreted into milk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ofev.\n\nFertility\nBased on preclinical investigations there is no evidence for impairment of male fertility (see \nsection 5.3). From subchronic and chronic toxicity studies, there is no evidence that female fertility in \nrats is impaired at a systemic exposure level comparable with that at the maximum recommended \nhuman dose (MRHD) of 150 mg twice daily (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOfev has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to be \ncautious when driving or using machines during treatment with Ofev.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials and during the post-marketing experience, the most frequently reported adverse\nreactions associated with the use of nintedanib included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal \npain, decreased appetite, weight decreased and hepatic enzyme increased.\n\nFor the management of selected adverse reactions see section 4.4.\n\n\n\n8\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 1 provides a summary of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by MedDRA System Organ Class\n(SOC) and frequency category using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Summary of ADRs per frequency category\nFrequency\n\nSystem Organ Class\npreferred term\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary\nfibrosis\n\nOther chronic \nfibrosing ILDs with a \nprogressive phenotype\n\nSystemic sclerosis \nassociated interstitial \n\nlung disease\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nThrombocytopenia Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nWeight decreased Common Common Common\nDecreased appetite Common Very common Common\nDehydration Uncommon Uncommon Not known\n\nCardiac disorders\nMyocardial \ninfarction\n\nUncommon Uncommon Not known\n\nVascular disorders\nBleeding (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nCommon Common Common\n\nHypertension Uncommon Common Common\nAneurysms and \nartery dissections\n\nNot known Not known Not known\n\nGastrointestinal disorder\nDiarrhoea Very common Very common Very common\nNausea Very common Very common Very common\nAbdominal pain Very common Very common Very common\nVomiting Common Very common Very common\nPancreatitis Uncommon Uncommon Not known\nColitis Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nDrug induced liver \ninjury\n\nUncommon Common Uncommon\n\nHepatic enzyme \nincreased\n\nVery common Very common Very common\n\nAlanine \naminotransferase\n(ALT) increased\n\nCommon Very common Common\n\nAspartate \naminotransferase\n(AST) increased\n\nCommon Common Common\n\nGamma glutamyl\ntransferase (GGT) \nincreased\n\nCommon Common Common\n\nHyperbilirubinaemia Uncommon Uncommon Not known\nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase (ALKP) \nincreased\n\nUncommon Common Common\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nRash Common Common Uncommon\nPruritus Uncommon Uncommon Uncommon\n\n\n\n9\n\nFrequency\n\nSystem Organ Class\npreferred term\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary\nfibrosis\n\nOther chronic \nfibrosing ILDs with a \nprogressive phenotype\n\nSystemic sclerosis \nassociated interstitial \n\nlung disease\nAlopecia Uncommon Uncommon Not known\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nRenal failure (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nNot known Uncommon Uncommon\n\nNervous system disorders\nHeadache Common Common Common\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nDiarrhoea\nIn clinical trials (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was the most frequent gastro-intestinal event reported. In \nmost patients, the event was of mild to moderate intensity. More than two thirds of patients \nexperiencing diarrhoea reported its first onset already during the first three months of treatment. In \nmost patients, the events were managed by anti-diarrhoeal therapy, dose reduction or treatment \ninterruption (see section 4.4). An overview of the reported diarrhoea events in the clinical trials is \nlisted in Table 2:\n\nTable 2: Diarrhoea in clinical trials over 52 weeks\n\nINPULSIS INBUILD SENSCIS\n\nPlacebo Ofev Placebo Ofev Placebo Ofev\n\nDiarrhoea 18.4% 62.4% 23.9% 66.9% 31.6% 75.7%\n\nSevere diarrhoea 0.5% 3.3% 0.9% 2.4% 1.0% 4.2%\n\nDiarrhoea \nleading to Ofev \ndose reduction\n\n0% 10.7% 0.9% 16.0% 1.0% 22.2%\n\nDiarrhoea \nleading to Ofev \ndiscontinuation\n\n0.2% 4.4% 0.3% 5.7% 0.3% 6.9%\n\nHepatic enzyme increased\nIn the INPULSIS trials, liver enzyme elevations (see section 4.4) were reported in 13.6% versus 2.6%\nof patients treated with Ofev and placebo, respectively. In the INBUILD trial, liver enzyme elevations \nwere reported in 22.6% versus 5.7% of patients treated with Ofev and placebo, respectively. In the \nSENSCIS trial, liver enzyme elevations were reported in 13.2% versus 3.1% of patients treated with \nOfev and placebo, respectively. Elevations of liver enzymes were reversible and not associated with \nclinically manifest liver disease.\nFor further information about special populations, recommended measures and dosing adjustments in \ncase of diarrhoea and hepatic enzyme increased, refer additionally to sections 4.4 and 4.2, \nrespectively.\n\nBleeding\nIn clinical trials, the frequency of patients who experienced bleeding was slightly higher in patients \ntreated with Ofev or comparable between the treatment arms (Ofev 10.3% versus placebo 7.8% for \nINPULSIS; Ofev 11.1% versus placebo 12.7% for INBUILD; Ofev 11.1% versus placebo 8.3% for \nSENSCIS). Non-serious epistaxis was the most frequent bleeding event reported. Serious bleeding \nevents occurred with low frequencies in the 2 treatment groups (Ofev 1.3% versus placebo 1.4% for \nINPULSIS; Ofev 0.9% versus placebo 1.5% for INBUILD; Ofev 1.4% versus placebo 0.7% for \nSENSCIS).\nPost-marketing bleeding events include but are not limited to gastrointestinal, respiratory and central \nnervous organ systems, with the most frequent being gastrointestinal (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n10\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no specific antidote or treatment for Ofev overdose. Two patients in the oncology programme\nhad an overdose of maximum 600 mg twice daily up to eight days. Observed adverse reactions were \nconsistent with the known safety profile of nintedanib, i.e. increased liver enzymes and gastrointestinal \nsymptoms. Both patients recovered from these adverse reactions. In the INPULSIS trials, one patient \nwas inadvertently exposed to a dose of 600 mg daily for a total of 21 days. A non-serious adverse \nevent (nasopharyngitis) occurred and resolved during the period of incorrect dosing, with no onset of \nother reported events. In case of overdose, treatment should be interrupted and general supportive \nmeasures initiated as appropriate.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE31\n\nMechanism of action\nNintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor including the receptors platelet-derived\ngrowth factor receptor (PDGFR) \u03b1 and \u03b2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, and \nVEGFR 1-3. In addition, nintedanib inhibits Lck (lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase), Lyn\n(tyrosine-protein kinase lyn), Src (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase src), and CSF1R (colony\nstimulating factor 1 receptor) kinases. Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate \n(ATP) binding pocket of these kinases and blocks the intracellular signalling cascades, which have \nbeen demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling in interstitial lung \ndiseases.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn in vitro studies using human cells nintedanib has been shown to inhibit processes assumed to be \ninvolved in the initiation of the fibrotic pathogenesis, the release of pro-fibrotic mediators from \nperipheral blood monocytic cells and macrophage polarisation to alternatively activated macrophages. \nNintedanib has been demonstrated to inhibit fundamental processes in organ fibrosis, proliferation and\nmigration of fibroblasts and transformation to the active myofibroblast phenotype and secretion of \nextracellular matrix. In animal studies in multiple models of IPF, SSc/SSc-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis-\nassociated-(RA-)ILD and other organ fibrosis, nintedanib has shown anti-inflammatory effects and \nanti-fibrotic effects in the lung, skin, heart, kidney, and liver. Nintedanib also exerted vascular activity. \nIt reduced dermal microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis and attenuated pulmonary vascular \nremodelling by reducing the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, the thickness of pulmonary \nvessel walls and percentage of occluded pulmonary vessels.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)\n\nThe clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in patients with IPF in two phase III, randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies with identical design (INPULSIS-1 (1199.32) and \nINPULSIS-2 (1199.34)). Patients with FVC baseline < 50% predicted or carbon monoxide diffusing \ncapacity (DLCO, corrected for haemoglobin) < 30% predicted at baseline were excluded from the \ntrials. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to treatment with Ofev 150 mg or placebo twice daily \nfor 52 weeks.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nThe primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC).

The estimated mean change from baseline to week 52 in SGRQ \ntotal score was smaller in the nintedanib group (3.53) than in the placebo group (4.96), with a \ndifference between the treatment groups of -1.43 (95% CI: -3.09, 0.23; p=0.0923). Overall, the effect \nof nintedanib on health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ total score is modest, \nindicating less worsening compared to placebo.\n\nTime to first acute IPF exacerbation\nIn the pooled analysis of the INPULSIS trials, a numerically lower risk of first acute exacerbation was \nobserved in patients receiving nintedanib compared to placebo.

Patients who completed the 52-\nweek treatment period in an INPULSIS trial received open-label Ofev treatment in the extension trial \nINPULSIS-ON. Median exposure time for patients treated with Ofev in both the INPULSIS and \nINPULSIS-ON trials was 44.7 months (range 11.9 \u2013 68.3). The exploratory efficacy endpoints \nincluded the annual rate of decline in FVC over 192 weeks which was \u2212135.1 (5.8) mL/year in all \npatients treated and were consistent with the annual rate of FVC decline in patients treated with Ofev\nin the INPULSIS phase III trials (\u2212113.6 mL per year). The adverse event profile of Ofev in \nINPULSIS-ON was consistent to that in the INPULSIS phase III trials.\n\nIPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (INSTAGE)\nINSTAGE was a multicentre, multinational, prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group \nclinical trial in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (DLCO \u2264 35% predicted) for 24 \nweeks. 136 patients were treated with Ofev monotherapy. Primary endpoint result showed a reduction \nof St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score by -0.77 units at week W12, based on \nadjusted mean change from baseline. A post hoc comparison demonstrated that the decline in FVC in \nthese patients was consistent with the decline in FVC in patients with less advanced disease and \ntreated with Ofev in the INPULSIS phase III trials.\nThe safety and tolerability profile of Ofev in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment was \nconsistent with that seen in the INPULSIS phase III trials.\n\nAdditional data from the phase IV INJOURNEY trial with Ofev 150 mg twice daily and add-on \npirfenidone\nConcomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone has been investigated in an exploratory open-\nlabel, randomised trial of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg \nthree times a day) compared to nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in 105 randomised patients for 12 \nweeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal adverse events from \nbaseline to week 12. Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequent and in line with the established \nsafety profile of each component. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most frequent adverse \nevents reported in patients, treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus nintedanib alone, \nrespectively.\nMean (SE) absolute changes from baseline in FVC at week 12 were \u221213.3 (17.4) mL in patients \ntreated with nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone (n=48) compared to \u221240.9 (31.4) mL in patients \ntreated with nintedanib alone (n=44).\n\n\n\n16\n\nOther chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype\n\nThe clinical efficacy of Ofev has been studied in patients with other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a \nprogressive phenotype in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (INBUILD). \nPatients with IPF were excluded. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were \nselected if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented \nwith clinical signs of progression (defined as FVC decline \u226510%, FVC decline \u2265 5% and <10% \nwith worsening symptoms or imaging, or worsening symptoms and worsening imaging all in the \n24 months prior to screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% \nof predicted and a DLCO 30% to less than 80% of predicted. Patients were required to have \nprogressed despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice for the patient\u2019s relevant \nILD.\n\nA total of 663 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ofev 150 mg bid or matching \nplacebo for at least 52 weeks. The median Ofev exposure over the whole trial was 17.4 months and the \nmean Ofev exposure over the whole trial was 15.6 months. Randomisation was stratified based on \nHRCT fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers. 412 patients with HRCT with usual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)-like fibrotic pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were \nrandomised. There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the \noverall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern. Patients with other HRCT \nfibrotic patterns represented the \u2018complementary\u2019 population.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) (in mL) over \n52 weeks. Main secondary endpoints were absolute change from baseline in King's Brief Interstitial \nLung Disease Questionnaire (K-BILD) total score at week 52, time to first acute ILD exacerbation or \ndeath over 52 weeks, and time to death over 52 weeks.\n\nPatients had a mean (standard deviation [SD, Min-Max]) age of 65.8 (9.8, 27-87) years and a mean \nFVC percent predicted of 69.0% (15.6, 42-137). The underlying clinical ILD diagnoses in groups \nrepresented in the trial were hypersensitivity pneumonitis (26.1%), autoimmune ILDs (25.6%), \nidiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (18.9%), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia \n(17.2%), and other ILDs (12.2%).\n\nThe INBUILD trial was not designed or powered to provide evidence for a benefit of nintedanib in \nspecific diagnostic subgroups. Consistent effects were demonstrated in subgroups based on the ILD \ndiagnoses. The experience with nintedanib in very rare progressive fibrosing ILDs is limited.\n\nAnnual rate of decline in FVC\nThe annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 107.0 mL in \npatients receiving Ofev compared to patients receiving placebo (Table 8) corresponding to a relative \ntreatment effect of 57.0%.\n\nTable 8: Annual rate of decline in FVC (mL) over 52 weeks\n\nPlacebo Ofev\n150 mg twice daily\n\nNumber of analysed patients 331 332\nRate1 (SE) of decline over \n52 weeks -187.8 (14.8) -80.8 (15.1)\nComparison vs placebo\nDifference1 107.0\n\n95% CI (65.4, 148.5)\np-value < 0.0001\n\n1Based on a random coefficient regression with fixed categorical effects of treatment, HRCT pattern, fixed \ncontinuous effects of time, baseline FVC [mL], and including treatment-by-time and baseline-by-time \ninteractions\n\n\n\n17\n\nSimilar results were observed in the co-primary population of patients with HRCT with UIP-like \nfibrotic pattern.

The proportion of patients with an event was 35.2% in the \nOfev group and 48.3% in the placebo group. The HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; p=0.0003), \nindicating a 34% reduction of the risk of progression (\u2265 10% absolute decline of FVC % predicted) or \ndeath in patients receiving Ofev compared to placebo.\n\nQuality of life\nThe adjusted mean change from baseline in K-BILD total score at week 52 was -0.79 units in the \nplacebo group and 0.55 in the Ofev group.

Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD \nbased upon the 2013 American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism \nclassification criteria for SSc and a chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan \nconducted within the previous 12 months. A total of 580 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to \nreceive either Ofev 150 mg bid or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of which 576 patients were \ntreated. Randomisation was stratified by antitopoisomerase antibody status (ATA). Individual patients \nstayed on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks (median Ofev exposure 15.4 months; mean Ofev \nexposure 14.5 months).\n\nThe primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks. Key secondary endpoints \nwere absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at week 52 and \nabsolute change from baseline in the Saint George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at \nweek 52.\n\nIn the overall population, 75.2% of the patients were female. The mean (standard deviation [SD, Min-\nMax]) age was 54.0 (12.2, 20-79) years. Overall, 51.9% of patients had diffuse cutaneous systemic \nsclerosis (SSc) and 48.1% had limited cutaneous SSc. The mean (SD) time since first onset of a non-\nRaynaud symptom was 3.49 (1.7) years. 49.0% of patients were on stable therapy with mycophenolate \nat baseline. The safety profile in patients with or without mycophenolate at baseline was comparable.\n\nAnnual rate of decline in FVC\nThe annual rate of decline of FVC (mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 41.0 mL in \npatients receiving Ofev compared to patients receiving placebo (Table 10) corresponding to a relative \ntreatment effect of 43.8%.\n\nTable 10: Annual rate of decline in FVC (mL) over 52 weeks\n\nPlacebo Ofev\n\n150 mg twice daily\n\nNumber of analysed patients 288 287\n\nRate1 (SE) of decline over \n52 weeks\n\n-93.3 (13.5) -52.4 (13.8)\n\nComparison vs placebo\n\nDifference1 41.0\n\n95% CI (2.9, 79.0)\n\np-value <0.05\n1Based on a random coefficient regression with fixed categorical effects of treatment, ATA status, gender, fixed \n\ncontinuous effects of time, baseline FVC [mL], age, height, and including treatment-by-time and baseline-by-\n\ntime interactions. Random effect was included for patient specific intercept and time. Within-patient errors were \n\nmodelled by an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. Inter-individual variability was modelled by a \n\nvariance-components variance-covariance matrix.\n\nThe effect of Ofev in reducing the annual rate of decline in FVC was similar across pre-specified \nsensitivity analyses and no heterogeneity was detected in pre-specified subgroups (e.g. by age, gender, \nand mycophenolate use).\n\nIn addition, similar effects were observed on other lung function endpoints, e.g absolute change from \nbaseline in FVC in mL at week 52 (Figure 5 and Table 11) and rate of decline in FVC in % predicted \nover 52 weeks (Table 12) providing further substantiation of the effects of Ofev on slowing \nprogression of SSc-ILD. Furthermore, fewer patients in the Ofev group had an absolute FVC decline \n> 5% predicted (20.6% in the Ofev group vs. 28.5% in the placebo group, OR=0.65, p=0.0287). The \nrelative FVC decline in mL > 10% was comparable between both groups (16.7% in the Ofev group vs. \n\n\n\n22\n\n18.1% in the placebo group, OR=0.91, p=0.6842). In these analyses, missing FVC values at week 52 \nwere imputed with the patient\u2019s worst value on treatment.\n\nAn exploratory analysis of data up to 100 weeks (maximum treatment duration in SENSCIS) \nsuggested that the on treatment effect of Ofev on slowing progression of SSc-ILD persisted beyond \n52 weeks.\n\nFigure 5: Mean (SEM) observed FVC change from baseline (mL) over 52 weeks\n\nbid = twice daily\n\nTable 11: Absolute change from baseline in FVC (mL) at week 52\n\nPlacebo Ofev\n\n150 mg twice daily\n\nNumber of analysed patients 288 288\n\nMean (SD) at Baseline 2541.0 (815.5) 2458.5 (735.9)\n\nMean1 (SE) change from \nbaseline at week 52\n\n-101.0 (13.6) -54.6 (13.9)\n\nComparison vs placebo\n\nMean1 46.4\n\n95% CI (8.1, 84.7)\n\np-value <0.05\n1Based on Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), with fixed categorical effects of ATA status, visit, \ntreatment-by-visit interaction, baseline-by-visit interaction age, gender and height.

Random effect was included for patient specific intercept and time. Within-patient errors were \nmodelled by an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. Inter-individual variability was modelled by a \nvariance-components variance-covariance matrix\n\nChange from baseline in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at week 52\nThe adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in mRSS at week 52 was comparable between the \nOfev group (-2.17 (95% CI -2.69, -1.65)) and the placebo group (-1.96 (95% CI -2.48, -1.45)). The \nadjusted mean difference between the treatment groups was -0.21 (95% CI -0.94, 0.53; p = 0.5785).\n\nChange from baseline in St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at week 52\nThe adjusted mean absolute change from baseline in SGRQ total score at week 52 was comparable \nbetween the Ofev group (0.81 (95% CI -0.92, 2.55)) and the placebo group (-0.88 (95% CI -2.58, \n0.82)). The adjusted mean difference between the treatment groups was 1.69 (95% CI -0.73, 4.12; \np = 0.1711).\n\nSurvival analysis\nMortality over the whole trial was comparable between the Ofev group (N = 10; 3.5%) and the \nplacebo group (N = 9; 3.1%). The analysis of time to death over the whole trial resulted in a HR of \n1.16 (95% CI 0.47, 2.84; p = 0.7535).\n\nQT interval\nIn a dedicated study in renal cell cancer patients, QT/QTc measurements were recorded and showed \nthat a single oral dose of 200 mg nintedanib as well as multiple oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib \nadministered twice daily for 15 days did not prolong the QTcF interval.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ofev \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in IPF (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nNintedanib reached maximum plasma concentrations approximately 2 - 4 h after oral administration as \nsoft gelatine capsule under fed conditions (range 0.5 - 8 h). The absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg \ndose was 4.69% (90% CI: 3.615 - 6.078) in healthy volunteers. Absorption and bioavailability are \ndecreased by transporter effects and substantial first-pass metabolism. Dose proportionality was shown \nby increase of nintedanib exposure (dose range 50 - 450 mg once daily and 150 - 300 mg twice daily). \nSteady state plasma concentrations were achieved within one week of dosing at the latest.\n\nAfter food intake, nintedanib exposure increased by approximately 20% compared to administration \nunder fasted conditions (CI: 95.3 - 152.5%) and absorption was delayed (median tmax fasted: 2.00 h; \nfed: 3.98 h).\n\n\n\n24\n\nDistribution\nNintedanib follows at least bi-phasic disposition kinetics. After intravenous infusion, a high volume of \ndistribution (Vss: 1,050 L, 45.0% gCV) was observed.\n\nThe in vitro protein binding of nintedanib in human plasma was high, with a bound fraction of 97.8%. \nSerum albumin is considered to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed \nin plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.869.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is hydrolytic cleavage by esterases resulting in the free \nacid moiety BIBF 1202. BIBF 1202 is subsequently glucuronidated by uridine 5'-diphospho-\nglucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGT) enzymes, namely UGT 1A1, UGT 1A7, UGT 1A8, and \nUGT 1A10 to BIBF 1202 glucuronide.\n\nOnly a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways, with \nCYP 3A4 being the predominant enzyme involved. The major CYP-dependent metabolite could not be \ndetected in plasma in the human ADME study. In vitro, CYP-dependent metabolism accounted for \nabout 5% compared to about 25% ester cleavage. Nintedanib, BIBF 1202, and BIBF 1202 glucuronide \ndid not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies, either. Drug-drug interactions between \nnintedanib and CYP substrates, CYP inhibitors, or CYP inducers are therefore not expected.\n\nElimination\nTotal plasma clearance after intravenous infusion was high (CL: 1,390 mL/min, 28.8% gCV). Urinary \nexcretion of the unchanged active substance within 48 h was about 0.05% of the dose (31.5% gCV) \nafter oral and about 1.4% of the dose (24.2% gCV) after intravenous administration; the renal \nclearance was 20 mL/min (32.6% gCV). The major route of elimination of drug related radioactivity \nafter oral administration of [14C] nintedanib was via faecal/biliary excretion (93.4% of dose, \n2.61% gCV). The contribution of renal excretion to the total clearance was low (0.649% of dose, \n26.3% gCV). The overall recovery was considered complete (above 90%) within 4 days after dosing. \nThe terminal half-life of nintedanib was between 10 and 15 h (gCV % approximately 50%).\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of nintedanib can be considered linear with respect to time (i.e. single-\ndose data can be extrapolated to multiple-dose data). Accumulation upon multiple administrations was \n1.04-fold for Cmax and 1.38-fold for AUC\u03c4. Nintedanib trough concentrations remained stable for more \nthan one year.\n\nTransport\nNintedanib is a substrate of P-gp. For the interaction potential of nintedanib with this transporter, see \nsection 4.5. Nintedanib was shown to be not a substrate or inhibitor of OATP-1B1, OATP-1B3, \nOATP-2B1, OCT-2, or MRP-2 in vitro. Nintedanib was also not a substrate of BCRP. Only a weak \ninhibitory potential on OCT-1, BCRP, and P-gp was observed in vitro which is considered to be of \nlow clinical relevance. The same applies for nintedanib being a substrate of OCT-1.\n\nPopulation pharmocokinetic analysis in special populations\nThe PK properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, patients with IPF, patients with \nother chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, patients with SSc-ILD, and cancer \npatients. Based on results of a population PK (PopPK) analysis in patients with IPF and non small cell \nlung cancer (NSCLC) (N=1,191) and descriptive investigations, exposure to nintedanib was not \ninfluenced by sex (body weight corrected), mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated by \ncreatinine clearance), alcohol consumption, or P-gp genotype. \nPopPK analyses indicated moderate effects on exposure to nintedanib depending on age, body weight, \nand race (see below). Based on the high inter-individual variability of exposure observed moderate \neffects are considered not clinically relevant (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n25\n\nAge\nExposure to nintedanib increased linearly with age. AUC\u03c4,ss decreased by 16% for a 45-year old patient \nand increased by 13% for a 76-year old patient relative to a patient with the median age of 62 years. \nThe age range covered by the analysis was 29 to 85 years; approximately 5% of the population were \nolder than 75 years. Based on a PopPK model, an increase in nintedanib exposure of approximately \n20 - 25% was observed in patients \u2265 75 years compared with patients under 65 years.\n\nStudies in paediatric populations have not been performed.\n\nBody weight\nAn inverse correlation between body weight and exposure to nintedanib was observed. AUC\u03c4,ss \n\nincreased by 25% for a 50 kg patient (5th percentile) and decreased by 19% for a 100 kg patient \n(95th percentile) relative to a patient with the median weight of 71.5 kg.\n\nRace\nThe population mean exposure to nintedanib was 33 - 50% higher in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian \npatients and 16% higher in Japanese patients while it was 16 - 22% lower in Koreans compared to \nCaucasians (body weight corrected). Data from Black individuals were very limited but in the same \nrange as for Caucasians.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn a dedicated single dose phase I study and compared to healthy subjects, exposure to nintedanib \nbased on Cmax and AUC was 2.2-fold higher in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment (Child \nPugh A; 90% CI 1.3 \u2013 3.7 for Cmax and 1.2 \u2013 3.8 for AUC, respectively). In volunteers with moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), exposure was 7.6-fold higher based on Cmax (90% CI 4.4 \u2013 13.2) \nand 8.7-fold higher (90% CI 5.7 \u2013 13.1) based on AUC, respectively, compared to healthy volunteers. \nSubjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) have not been studied.\n\nConcomitant treatment with pirfenidone\nIn a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of nintedanib with pirfenidone was \ninvestigated in patients with IPF. Group 1 received a single dose of 150 mg nintedanib before and after \nuptitration to 801 mg pirfenidone three times a day at steady state (N=20 patients treated). Group 2 \nreceived steady state treatment of 801 mg pirfenidone three times a day and had a PK profiling before \nand after at least 7 days of co-treatment with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily (N=17 patients treated). In \ngroup 1, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval (CI)) were 93% (57% - 151%) \nand 96% (70% - 131%) for Cmax and AUC0-tz of nintedanib, respectively (n=12 for intraindividual \ncomparison). In group 2, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CI)) were 97% (86% - 110%) and \n95% (86% - 106%) for Cmax,ss and AUC\u03c4,ss of pirfenidone, respectively (n=12 for intraindividual \ncomparison).\nBased on these results, there is no evidence of a relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction \nbetween nintedanib and pirfenidone when administered in combination (see section 4.4).\n\nConcomitant treatment with bosentan\nIn a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, concomitant treatment of Ofev with bosentan was investigated \nin healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of 150 mg Ofev before and after multiple dosing \nof 125 mg bosentan twice daily at steady state. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence \ninterval (CI)) were 103% (86% - 124%) and 99% (91% - 107%) for Cmax and AUC0-tz of nintedanib, \nrespectively (n=13), indicating that co-administration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the \npharmacokinetics of nintedanib.\n\nConcomitant treatment with oral hormonal contraceptives\nIn a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, female patients with SSc-ILD received a single dose of a \ncombination of 30 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol and 150 \u00b5g levonorgestrel before and after twice daily dosing of \n150 mg nintedanib for at least 10 days. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval \n(CI)) were 117% (108% - 127%; Cmax) and 101% (93% - 111%; AUC0\u2013tz) for ethinylestradiol and \n101% (90% - 113%; Cmax) and 96% (91% - 102%; AUC0\u2013tz) for levonorgestrel, respectively (n=15), \n\n\n\n26\n\nindicating that co-administration of nintedanib has no relevant effect on the plasma exposure of \nethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.\n\nExposure-response relationship\nExposure-response analyses of patients with IPF and other chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive \nphenotype, indicated a weak relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and ALT and/or AST \nelevations. Actual administered dose might be the better predictor for the risk of developing diarrhoea \nof any intensity, even if plasma exposure as risk determining factor could not be ruled out (see section \n4.4).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGeneral toxicology\nSingle dose toxicity studies in rats and mice indicated a low acute toxic potential of nintedanib. In \nrepeat dose toxicology studies in rats, adverse effects (e.g. thickening of epiphyseal plates, lesions of \nthe incisors) were mostly related to the mechanism of action (i.e. VEGFR-2 inhibition) of nintedanib. \nThese changes are known from other VEGFR-2 inhibitors and can be considered class effects. \n\nDiarrhoea and vomiting accompanied by reduced food consumption and loss of body weight were \nobserved in toxicity studies in non-rodents.\n\nThere was no evidence of liver enzyme increases in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Mild liver \nenzyme increases, which were not due to serious adverse effects such as diarrhoea were only observed \nin rhesus monkeys.\n\nReproduction toxicity\nIn rats, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at exposure levels below human \nexposure at the MRHD of 150 mg twice daily. Effects on the development of the axial skeleton and on \nthe development of the great arteries were also noted at subtherapeutic exposure levels. \n\nIn rabbits, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at an exposure approximately \n3 times higher than at the MRHD but equivocal effects on the embryo-foetal development of the axial \nskeleton and the heart were noted already at an exposure below that at the MRHD of 150 mg twice \ndaily. \n\nIn a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, effects on pre- and post-natal development were \nseen at an exposure below the MRHD.\n\nA study of male fertility and early embryonic development up to implantation in rats did not reveal \neffects on the male reproductive tract and male fertility. \n\nIn rats, small amounts of radiolabelled nintedanib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk \n(\u2264 0.5% of the administered dose). \n\nFrom the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, there was no evidence for a carcinogenic \npotential of nintedanib.\n\nGenotoxicity studies indicated no mutagenic potential for nintedanib.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Ofev is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Ofev\n3. How to take Ofev\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ofev\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Ofev is and what it is used for\n\nOfev contains the active substance nintedanib, a medicine belonging to the class of so-called tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors, and it is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other chronic \nfibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis \nassociated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in adults.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)\nIPF is a condition in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff and scarred over time. As \na result, scarring reduces the ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and it \nbecomes difficult to breathe deeply. Ofev helps to reduce scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\nOther chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype\nBesides IPF, there are other conditions in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff, and \nscarred over time (lung fibrosis) and keeps worsening (progressive phenotype). Examples of these \nconditions are hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis associated \nILD), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, \nand other ILDs. Ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\nSystemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that affects \nconnective tissue in many parts of the body. SSc causes fibrosis (scarring and stiffening) of the skin \nand other internal organs such as the lungs. When the lungs are affected by fibrosis, it is called \ninterstitial lung disease (ILD), and so the condition is called SSc-ILD. Fibrosis in the lungs reduces the \nability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream, and breathing capacity is reduced. Ofev helps to reduce \nfurther scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ofev\n\nDo not take Ofev\n- if you are pregnant,\n\n\n\n41\n\n- if you are allergic to nintedanib, peanut or soya, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ofev,\n- if you have or ever had liver problems, \n- if you have or ever had problems with your kidney,\n- if you have or ever had bleeding problems,\n- if you take blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin, phenprocoumon or heparin) to prevent \n\nblood clotting,\n- if you take pirfenidone as this may increase the risk of having diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver \n\nproblems,\n- if you have or ever had problems with your heart (for example a heart attack),\n- if you have recently had surgery. Nintedanib may affect the way your wounds heal. Therefore, your \n\ntreatment with Ofev will usually be stopped for a while if you are having a surgery. Your doctor \nwill decide when to resume your treatment with this medicine.\n\n- if you have high blood pressure,\n- if you have abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary\n\nhypertension),\n- if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear \n\nin a blood vessel wall.\n\nBased on this information your doctor may do some blood tests, for example to check your liver \nfunction. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you and decide whether you may \nreceive Ofev.\n\nInform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine, \n- if you get diarrhoea. Treating diarrhoea early is important (see section 4);\n- if you vomit or feel sick (nausea);\n- if you have unexplained symptoms such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes \n\n(jaundice), dark or brown (tea coloured) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area \n(abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, or feeling tired. This could be symptoms \nof serious liver problems;\n\n- if you have severe pain in your stomach, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or abdominal rigidity or \nbloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut (\u2018gastrointestinal \nperforation\u2019). Also, tell your doctor if you had peptic ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or \nare concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and \nswelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and allergies), as this may increase this risk;\n\n- if you have a combination of severe pain or cramping in your stomach, red blood in your stool or \ndiarrhea as these could be symptoms of a bowel inflammation from inadequate blood supply;\n\n- if you have pain, swelling, reddening, warmth of a limb as this could be symptoms of a blood clot \nin one of your veins (a type of blood vessel);\n\n- if you have chest pressure or pain, typically on the left side of the body, pain in the neck, jaw, \nshoulder or arm, a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, as this could be symptoms \nof a heart attack;\n\n- if you have any major bleeding.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nOfev should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Ofev\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nOfev can interact with certain other medicines. The following medicines are examples that may \nincrease the levels of nintedanib in your blood, and hence may increase the risk for side effects (see \nsection 4):\n\n\n\n42\n\n- a medicine used to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole)\n- a medicine used to treat bacterial infections (erythromycin)\n- a medicine that affects your immune system (cyclosporine)\n\nThe following medicines are examples that may lower the levels of nintedanib in your blood and thus \nmay reduce the effectiveness of Ofev:\n- an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin)\n- medicines to treat seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin)\n- a herbal medicine to treat depression (St. John\u2019s Wort)\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy\nDo not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects.\n\nYou must have a pregnancy test done to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with \nOfev. Please talk to your doctor.\n\nContraception\n- Women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to prevent \n\npregnancy when they start taking Ofev, while they are taking Ofev and for at least 3 months after \nstopping treatment.\n\n- You should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor.\n- Vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral \n\nhormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness.Therefore, \nif experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate method of \ncontraception.\n\n- Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant \nduring treatment with Ofev. \n\nBreast-feeding\nDo not breast-feed during the treatment with Ofev since there may be a risk of harm to the breast-fed \nchild.\n\nDriving and using machines\nOfev may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You should not drive or use \nmachines if you feel sick.\n\nOfev contains soya lecithin\nIf you are allergic to soya or peanut, do not take this medicine (see section 2).\n\n3. How to take Ofev\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule of 100 mg twice daily (a total of 200 mg per day). Take the \ncapsules twice daily approximately 12 hours apart at about the same time every day, for example one \ncapsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening.

What Ofev is and what it is used for\n\nOfev contains the active substance nintedanib, a medicine belonging to the class of so-called tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors, and it is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other chronic \nfibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis \nassociated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in adults.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)\nIPF is a condition in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff and scarred over time. As \na result, scarring reduces the ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and it \nbecomes difficult to breathe deeply. Ofev helps to reduce scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\nOther chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype\nBesides IPF, there are other conditions in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff, and \nscarred over time (lung fibrosis) and keeps worsening (progressive phenotype). Examples of these \nconditions are hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis associated \nILD), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, \nand other ILDs. Ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\nSystemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that affects \nconnective tissue in many parts of the body. SSc causes fibrosis (scarring and stiffening) of the skin \nand other internal organs such as the lungs. When the lungs are affected by fibrosis, it is called \ninterstitial lung disease (ILD), and so the condition is called SSc-ILD. Fibrosis in the lungs reduces the \nability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream, and breathing capacity is reduced. Ofev helps to reduce \nfurther scarring and stiffening of the lungs.\n\n\n\n50\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ofev\n\nDo not take Ofev\n- if you are pregnant,\n- if you are allergic to nintedanib, peanut or soya, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ofev,\n- if you have or ever had liver problems, \n- if you have or ever had problems with your kidney,\n- if you have or ever had bleeding problems,\n- if you take blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin, phenprocoumon or heparin) to prevent \n\nblood clotting,\n- if you take pirfenidone as this may increase the risk of having diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver \n\nproblems,\n- if you have or ever had problems with your heart (for example a heart attack),\n- if you have recently had surgery. Nintedanib may affect the way your wounds heal. Therefore, your \n\ntreatment with Ofev will usually be stopped for a while if you are having a surgery. Your doctor \nwill decide when to resume your treatment with this medicine.\n\n- if you have high blood pressure,\n- if you have abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary\n\nhypertension),\n- if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear \n\nin a blood vessel wall.\n\nBased on this information your doctor may do some blood tests, for example to check your liver \nfunction. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you and decide whether you may \nreceive Ofev.\n\nInform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine, \n- if you get diarrhoea. Treating diarrhoea early is important (see section 4);\n- if you vomit or feel sick (nausea);\n- if you have unexplained symptoms such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes \n\n(jaundice), dark or brown (tea coloured) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area \n(abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, or feeling tired. This could be symptoms \nof serious liver problems;\n\n- if you have severe pain in your stomach, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or abdominal rigidity or \nbloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut (\u2018gastrointestinal \nperforation\u2019). Also, tell your doctor if you had peptic ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or \nare concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and \nswelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and allergies), as this may increase this risk;\n\n- if you have a combination of severe pain or cramping in your stomach, red blood in your stool or \ndiarrhea as these could be symptoms of a bowel inflammation from inadequate blood supply;\n\n- if you have pain, swelling, reddening, warmth of a limb as this could be symptoms of a blood clot \nin one of your veins (a type of blood vessel);\n\n- if you have chest pressure or pain, typically on the left side of the body, pain in the neck, jaw, \nshoulder or arm, a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, as this could be symptoms \nof a heart attack;\n\n- if you have any major bleeding.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nOfev should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\n\n\n51\n\nOther medicines and Ofev\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nOfev can interact with certain other medicines. The following medicines are examples that may \nincrease the levels of nintedanib in your blood, and hence may increase the risk for side effects (see \nsection 4):\n- a medicine used to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole)\n- a medicine used to treat bacterial infections (erythromycin)\n- a medicine that affects your immune system (cyclosporine)\n\nThe following medicines are examples that may lower the levels of nintedanib in your blood and thus \nmay reduce the effectiveness of Ofev:\n- an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin)\n- medicines to treat seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin)\n- a herbal medicine to treat depression (St. John\u2019s Wort)\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy\nDo not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects.\n\nYou must have a pregnancy test done to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with \nOfev. Please talk to your doctor.\n\nContraception\n- Women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to prevent \n\npregnancy when they start taking Ofev while they are taking Ofev and for at least 3 months after \nstopping treatment.\n\n- You should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor.\n- Vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral \n\nhormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness. Therefore,\nif experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate method of \ncontraception.\n\n- Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant \nduring treatment with Ofev.\n\nBreast-feeding\nDo not breast-feed during the treatment with Ofev since there may be a risk of harm to the breast-fed \nchild.\n\nDriving and using machines\nOfev may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You should not drive or use \nmachines if you feel sick.\n\nOfev contains soya lecithin\nIf you are allergic to soya or peanut, do not take this medicine (see section 2).\n\n3. How to take Ofev\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\n\n\n52\n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule of 150 mg twice daily (a total of 300 mg per day). Take the \ncapsules twice daily approximately 12 hours apart at about the same time every day, for example one \ncapsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening. This ensures that a steady amount of \nnintedanib is maintained in your blood stream. Swallow the whole capsules with water and do not \nchew or crush the capsules. It is recommended that you take the capsules with food, i.e. during or \nimmediately before or after a meal.\n\nDo not take more than the recommended dose of two Ofev 150 mg capsules per day.\n\nIf you do not tolerate the recommended dose of two Ofev 150 mg capsules per day (see possible side \neffects in section 4) your doctor may reduce the daily dose of Ofev. Do not reduce the dose or stop the \ntreatment by yourself without consulting your doctor first.\n\nYour doctor may reduce your recommended dose to two times 100 mg per day (a total of 200 mg per \nday). In this case your doctor will prescribe Ofev 100 mg capsules for your treatment. Do not take \nmore than the recommended dose of two Ofev 100 mg capsules per day if your daily dose was reduced \nto 200 mg per day.\n\nIf you take more Ofev than you should\nContact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Ofev\nDo not take two capsules together if you have forgotten to take your earlier dose.You should take your \nnext 150 mg dose of Ofev as planned at the next scheduled time recommended by your doctor or \npharmacist.\n\nIf you stop taking Ofev\nDo not stop taking Ofev without consulting your doctor first. It is important to take this medicine every \nday, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

The biologic plausibility of an association between \nnintedanib and ischaemic colitis based upon its inhibitory action of the VEGF-receptor appears \nreasonable. The PRAC concluded that the product information of nintedanib for respiratory \nindications (Ofev) should be amended accordingly.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for nintedanib (respiratory indication) the CHMP is of the \nopinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nintedanib (respiratory \nindication) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.\tMANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tD.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\tA. LABELLING\n\tB. PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\tSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what ofev is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "ofev contains the active substance nintedanib, a medicine belonging to the class of so-called tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and it is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf), other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype and systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (ssc-ild) in adults. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) ipf is a condition in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff and scarred over time. as a result, scarring reduces the ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and it becomes difficult to breathe deeply. ofev helps to reduce scarring and stiffening of the lungs. other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ilds) with a progressive phenotype besides ipf, there are other conditions in which the tissue in your lungs becomes thickened, stiff, and scarred over time (lung fibrosis) and keeps worsening (progressive phenotype). examples of these conditions are hypersensitivity pneumonitis, autoimmune ilds (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis associated ild), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, and other ilds. ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs. systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (ssc-ild) systemic sclerosis (ssc), also known as scleroderma, is a rare chronic autoimmune disease that affects connective tissue in many parts of the body. ssc causes fibrosis (scarring and stiffening) of the skin and other internal organs such as the lungs. when the lungs are affected by fibrosis, it is called interstitial lung disease (ild), and so the condition is called ssc-ild. fibrosis in the lungs reduces the ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream, and breathing capacity is reduced. ofev helps to reduce further scarring and stiffening of the lungs.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ofev",

if you are allergic to nintedanib, peanut or soya, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ofev, - if you have or ever had liver problems, - if you have or ever had problems with your kidney, - if you have or ever had bleeding problems, - if you take blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin, phenprocoumon or heparin) to prevent blood clotting, - if you take pirfenidone as this may increase the risk of having diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and liver problems, - if you have or ever had problems with your heart (for example a heart attack), - if you have recently had surgery. nintedanib may affect the way your wounds heal. therefore, your treatment with ofev will usually be stopped for a while if you are having a surgery. your doctor will decide when to resume your treatment with this medicine. - if you have high blood pressure, - if you have abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), - if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a blood vessel wall. based on this information your doctor may do some blood tests, for example to check your liver function. your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you and decide whether you may receive ofev. inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine, - if you get diarrhoea. treating diarrhoea early is important (see section 4); - if you vomit or feel sick (nausea); - if you have unexplained symptoms such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice), dark or brown (tea coloured) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area (abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, or feeling tired. this could be symptoms of serious liver problems; - if you have severe pain in your stomach, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut ('gastrointestinal perforation'). also, tell your doctor if you had peptic ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) (used to treat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and allergies), as this may increase this risk; - if you have a combination of severe pain or cramping in your stomach, red blood in your stool or diarrhea as these could be symptoms of a bowel inflammation from inadequate blood supply; - if you have pain, swelling, reddening, warmth of a limb as this could be symptoms of a blood clot in one of your veins (a type of blood vessel); - if you have chest pressure or pain, typically on the left side of the body, pain in the neck, jaw, shoulder or arm, a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, as this could be symptoms of a heart attack; - if you have any major bleeding. children and adolescents ofev should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age. other medicines and ofev tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription. ofev can interact with certain other medicines. the following medicines are examples that may increase the levels of nintedanib in your blood, and hence may increase the risk for side effects (see section 4): 42 - a medicine used to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole) - a medicine used to treat bacterial infections (erythromycin) - a medicine that affects your immune system (cyclosporine) the following medicines are examples that may lower the levels of nintedanib in your blood and thus may reduce the effectiveness of ofev: - an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin) - medicines to treat seizures (carbamazepine, phenytoin) - a herbal medicine to treat depression (st. john's wort) pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. pregnancy do not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects. you must have a pregnancy test done to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with ofev. please talk to your doctor. contraception - women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy when they start taking ofev, while they are taking ofev and for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. - you should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor. - vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness.therefore, if experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate method of contraception. - tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with ofev. breast-feeding do not breast-feed during the treatment with ofev since there may be a risk of harm to the breast-fed child. driving and using machines ofev may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. you should not drive or use machines if you feel sick. ofev contains soya lecithin if you are allergic to soya or peanut, do not take this medicine
