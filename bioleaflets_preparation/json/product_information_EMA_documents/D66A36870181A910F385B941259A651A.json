NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 0.1 mg bimatoprost. \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nOne ml of solution contains 0.2 mg benzalkonium chloride.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution. \n \nColourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in \nadults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The \ndose should not exceed once daily, as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure \nlowering effect.  \n \nPaediatric population:  \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established. \n \nPatients with hepatic and renal impairment: \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and \nshould therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease \nor abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at \nbaseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 \nmonths. \n \nMethod of administration \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered \nat least 5 minutes apart. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is contraindicated in patients who have had a suspected previous adverse \nreaction to benzalkonium chloride that has led to discontinuation. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOcular \nBefore treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth, \ndarkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during \ntreatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to differences in \nappearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated. Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be \npermanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather \nthan to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iris pigmentation \nare not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be \nnoticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads \nconcentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts become more brownish. \nNeither naevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by the treatment. At 12 months, the \nincidence of iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution was 0.5%. At \n12 months, the incidence with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution was 1.5% (see section 4.8 \nTable 2) and did not increase following 3 years treatment. Periorbital tissue pigmentation has been \nreported to be reversible in some patients.  \n \nCystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) following treatment \nwith bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in \npatients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with \na torn posterior lens capsule). \n \nThere have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular \ninfections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in \npatients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis. \n \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, \ninflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.  \n \nSkin  \nThere is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in \ncontact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it \nrunning onto the cheek or other skin areas.  \n \nRespiratory \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function.  While there is \nlimited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of \nexacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post marketing \nexperience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or \ncompromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution. \n \nCardiovascular \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or \nuncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of \nbradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be \nused with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure. \n \nOther Information \nIn studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been \nshown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may \ndecrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin \nanalogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.  \n \nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride (200 ppm), which may be \nabsorbed by soft contact lenses. Eye irritation and discolouration of the soft contact lenses may also \n\n\n\n4 \n\noccur because of the presence of benzalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to \ninstillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.  \n \nBenzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been \nreported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since \nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains 200 ppm benzalkonium chloride (four times the concentration in \nbimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops), it should be used with caution in dry eye patients, in patients where \nthe cornea may be compromised and in patients taking multiple BAK-containing eye drops. In \naddition, monitoring is required with prolonged use in such patients.  \n \nThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of \ntopical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, \nin most cases, had a concurrent ocular disease. Patients with a disruption of the ocular epithelial \nsurface are at greater risk of developing bacterial keratitis. \n \nPatients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or \nsurrounding structures, to avoid eye injury and contamination of the solution.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nNo interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely \nlow (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. \nBimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic \ndrug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.  \n \nIn clinical studies, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml, eye drops, solution was used concomitantly with a number \nof different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.  \n \nConcomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not \nbeen evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.  \n \nThere is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be \nreduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin \nanalogues (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \n \nLUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-\nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular \ntreatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears \nbefore driving or using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nIn a 12-month Phase III clinical study approximately 38 % of patients treated with \nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently \nreported adverse reaction was conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a \nnon-inflammatory nature) occurring in 29 % of patients. Approximately 4 % of patients discontinued \ndue to any adverse event in the 12-month study.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye \ndrops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious. \n \nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse \nreactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1 in order of decreased seriousness \nwithin each frequency grouping.  \n \nTable 1. \n \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nNervous system disorders uncommon headache\n\nnot known dizziness\nEye disorders \n \n\nvery common conjunctival hyperaemia \ncommon punctate keratitis, eye irritation, eye \n\npruritus, growth of eyelashes,  \neye pain, erythema of eyelid, eyelid \npruritus\n\nuncommon asthenopia, blurred vision, \nconjunctival disorder, conjunctival \noedema, iris hyperpigmentation, \nmadarosis, eyelid oedema \n\nnot known blepharal pigmentation, macular \noedema, periorbital and lid changes \nincluding deepening of the eyelid \nsulcus, dry eye, eye discharge, eye \noedema, foreign body sensation in \neyes, lacrimation increased, ocular \ndiscomfort,  photophobia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nnot known asthma, asthma exacerbation, COPD \nexacerbation and dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders uncommon nausea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon skin hyperpigmentation, \nhypertrichosis\n\nuncommon dry skin, eyelid margin crusting, \npruritus\n\nnot known skin discoloration (periocular) \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\ncommon instillation site irritation \n\nImmune system disorders not known Hypersensitivity reaction including \nsigns and symptoms of eye allergy and \nallergic dermatitis \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVascular disorders not known hypertension\n\nIn clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml. On combining \nthe data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml usage, the most frequently \nreported adverse reactions were:  \n\n growth of eyelashes in up to 45 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing\nto 7 % at 2 years and 2 % at 3 years\n\n conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature)\nin up to 44 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13 % at 2 years\nand 12 % at 3 years  \n\n ocular pruritus in up to 14 % of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports\ndecreasing to 3 % at 2 years and 0 % at 3 years. Less than 9 % of patients discontinued due to\nany adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations \nbeing 3 % at both 2 and 3 years. \n\nAdditional adverse reactions reported with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml are presented in Table 2. The table \nalso includes those adverse reactions which occurred with both formulations but at a different \nfrequency. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was serious: With each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n\nTable 2. \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency  Adverse reaction \nNervous system disorders common headache\n\nuncommon dizziness\nEye disorders very common ocular pruritus, growth of eyelashes\n\ncommon corneal erosion, ocular burning, \nallergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, \nworsening of visual acuity, asthenopia, \nconjunctival oedema, foreign body \nsensation, ocular dryness, eye pain, \nphotophobia, tearing, eye discharge, \nvisual disturbance/blurred vision, \nincreased iris pigmentation, eyelash \ndarkening \n\nuncommon retinal haemorrhage, uveitis, cystoid \nmacular oedema, iritis, \nblepharospasm, eyelid retraction, \nperiorbital erythema \n\nVascular disorders common hypertension\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nuncommon hirsutism \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nuncommon asthenia \n\nInvestigations common liver function test abnormal \n\nAdverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops: \nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration. \n\nIf overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally \ningested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to \n100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m2 is at least 210 times higher \nthan the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.  \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01EE03. \n\nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by \nincreasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral \noutflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first \nadministration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of \neffect is maintained for at least 24 hours.  \n\nBimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to \nprostaglandin F2 (PGF2), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost \nselectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The \nprostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified. \n\nDuring a 12-month pivotal study in adults with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, the mean diurnal \nIOP values measured at any visit over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.1 mmHg \nthroughout the day and were never greater than 17.7 mmHg.  \n\nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops contains BAK in a concentration of 200 ppm. \n\nLimited experience is available with the use of LUMIGAN in patients with open-angle glaucoma with \npseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent \niridotomy. \n\nNo clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.  \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been \nestablished. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nBimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro. After ocular administration in \nadults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once \ndaily ocular administration of one drop of 0.3 mg/ml bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks, blood \nconcentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of \ndetection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar \non days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 nghr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady \nbimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDistribution \nBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in \nhumans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The \nplasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 %.  \n\nBiotransformation \nBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation \nfollowing ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to \nform a diverse variety of metabolites. \n\nElimination \nBimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67 % of an intravenous dose \nadministered to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25 % of the dose was excreted via \nthe faeces. The elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately \n45 minutes; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.  \nCharacteristics in elderly patients \nAfter twice daily dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution, the mean AUC0-24hr value of \n0.0634 nghr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than \n0.0218 nghr/ml in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic \nexposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no \naccumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and \nyoung patients. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nMonkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an \nincrease in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a \nprominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris \npigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and \nnot by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the \nperiocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is \nunknown.  \n\nBimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.  \n\nBimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the \nintended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental \neffects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the \ndose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times \nhigher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity \ncaused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at  0.3 mg/kg/day (at \nleast 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not \naffected.  \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 0.3 mg bimatoprost. \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nOne ml of solution contains 0.05 mg benzalkonium chloride.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution. \n \nColourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in \nadults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The \ndose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure \nlowering effect.  \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established. \n \nPatients with hepatic and renal impairment: \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and \nshould therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease \nor abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at \nbaseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 \nmonths. \n \nMethod of administration \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered \nat least 5 minutes apart.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml is contraindicated in patients who have had a suspected previous adverse \nreaction to benzalkonium chloride that has led to discontinuation. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOcular \nBefore treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth, \ndarkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during \ntreatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to differences in \nappearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated. Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be \npermanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather \nthan to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iris pigmentation \nare not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be \nnoticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads \nconcentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts become more brownish. \nNeither naevi nor freckles of the iris appears to be affected by the treatment. At 12 months, the \nincidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3mg/ml was 1.5% (see section 4.8) and did not \nincrease following 3 years treatment. Periorbital tissue pigmentation has been reported to be reversible \nin some patients. \n \nCystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) following treatment \nwith bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops. Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients \nwith known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn \nposterior lens capsule). \n \nThere have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular \ninfections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in \npatients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis. \n \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, \ninflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.  \n \nSkin  \nThere is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in \ncontact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it \nrunning onto the cheek or other skin areas.  \n \nRespiratory \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is \nlimited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of \nexacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post marketing \nexperience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or \ncompromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution. \n \nCardiovascular \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or \nuncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of \nbradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be \nused with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure. \n \nOther Information \nIn studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been \nshown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may \ndecrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin \nanalogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.  \n \nBimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which \nmay be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Eye irritation and discolouration of the soft contact lenses may \nalso occur because of the presence of benzalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior \nto instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nBenzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been \nreported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since LUMIGAN contains \nbenzalkonium chloride, monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients or \nwhere the cornea is compromised.  \n \nThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of \ntopical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, \nin most cases, had a concurrent ocular disease. Patients with a disruption of the ocular epithelial \nsurface are at greater risk of developing bacterial keratitis. \n \nPatients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or \nsurrounding structures, to avoid eye injury and contamination of the solution.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nNo interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely \nlow (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. \nBimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic \ndrug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.  \n \nIn clinical studies, LUMIGAN was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic \nbeta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.  \n \nConcomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not \nbeen evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.  \nThere is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be \nreduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin \nanalogues (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \n \nLUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular \ntreatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears \nbefore driving or using machines.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nIn clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, \nsolution. On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml \neye drops, solution usage, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were: growth \nof eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7% at 2 \nyears and 2% at 3 years, conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-\ninflammatory nature) in up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to \n13% at 2 years and 12% at 3 years and ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the \nincidence of new reports decreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years. Less than 9% of patients \ndiscontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient \ndiscontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years.  \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye \ndrops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was \nserious: \n \nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse \nreactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nNervous system disorders common headache\n\nuncommon dizziness\nEye disorders \n \n\nvery common conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular \npruritus, growth of eyelashes \n\ncommon superficial punctate keratitis, corneal \nerosion, ocular burning, ocular \nirritation, allergic conjunctivitis, \nblepharitis, worsening of visual acuity, \nasthenopia, conjunctival oedema, \nforeign body sensation, ocular \ndryness, eye pain, photophobia, \ntearing, eye discharge, visual \ndisturbance/blurred vision, increased \niris pigmentation, eyelash darkening, \neyelid erythema, eyelid pruritus\n\nuncommon retinal haemorrhage, uveitis, cystoid \nmacular oedema, iritis, \nblepharospasm, eyelid retraction, \nperiorbital erythema, eyelid oedema\n\nnot known periorbital and lid changes including \ndeepening of the eyelid sulcus ocular \ndiscomfort\n\nVascular disorders common hypertension\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nnot known asthma, asthma exacerbation, COPD \nexacerbation and dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders uncommon nausea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon pigmentation of periocular skin \nuncommon hirsutism\nnot known skin discoloration (periocular) \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nuncommon asthenia \n\nInvestigations common liver function test abnormal \nImmune system disorders not known Hypersensitivity reaction including \n\n\n\n14 \n\nsigns and symptoms of eye allergy and \nallergic dermatitis \n\nAdverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops: \nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration. \n\nIf overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally \ningested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to \n100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m2 is at least 70-times higher \nthan the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.  \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01EE03. \n\nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by \nincreasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral \noutflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first \nadministration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of \neffect is maintained for at least 24 hours.  \n\nBimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to \nprostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost \nselectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The \nprostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified. \n\nDuring 12 months’ monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml in adults, versus timolol, mean \nchange from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mm Hg. At any \nvisit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than \n1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg. \n\nIn a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, versus latanoprost, a statistically superior \nreduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus –6.0 to \n-7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. Conjunctival hyperaemia, \ngrowth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with \nlatanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically \nsignificant difference.\n\nCompared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and LUMIGAN \n0.3 mg/ml lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg. \n\n\n\n15 \n\nLimited experience is available in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and \npigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy. \n\nNo clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials. \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been \nestablished.  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nBimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro. After ocular administration in \nadults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once \ndaily ocular administration of one drop of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml to both eyes for two weeks, blood \nconcentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of \ndetection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar \non days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 nghr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady \nbimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.  \n\nDistribution \nBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in \nhumans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma.

Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to \nform a diverse variety of metabolites. \n\nElimination \nBimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered \nto healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The \nelimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the \ntotal blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.  \n\nCharacteristics in elderly patients \nAfter twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 nghr/ml \nbimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 nghr/ml \nin young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both \nelderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of \nbimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nMonkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an \nincrease in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a \nprominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris \npigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and \nnot by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the \nperiocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is \nunknown.  \n\nBimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\nBimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the \nintended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental \neffects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the \ndose in humans, respectively.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nReduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in \nadults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers).  \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The \ndose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure \nlowering effect.  \n\nFor single use only, one container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused solution should be \ndiscarded immediately after use. \n\nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established. \n\nPatients with hepatic and renal impairment: \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and \nshould therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease \nor abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at \nbaseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops (multi-dose formulation), solution had no adverse effect \non liver function over 24 months. \n\nMethod of administration \nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered \nat least 5 minutes apart. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\nOcular \nBefore treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of eyelash growth, \ndarkening of the eyelid skin and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during \ntreatment with LUMIGAN.

At 3 months, the incidence \nof iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL single dose was 0.3%. At 12 months, the \nincidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) was 1.5% (see \nsection 4.8) and did not increase following 3 years treatment. Periorbital tissue pigmentation has been \nreported to be reversible in some patients. \n\nCystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) following treatment \nwith bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops (multi-dose formulation).

LUMIGAN \nshould be used with caution in patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. \nherpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis. \n\nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, \ninflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.  \n\nSkin  \nThere is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in \ncontact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it \nrunning onto the cheek or other skin areas. \n\nRespiratory \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is \nlimited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of \nexacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post marketing \nexperience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or \ncompromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution. \n\nCardiovascular \nLUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or \nuncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of \nbradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). \nLUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood \npressure. \n\nOther Information \nIn studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been \nshown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may \ndecrease the IOP-lowering effect. Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin analogues \nshould be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure. \n\nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. \n\n\n\n20 \n\nContact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following \nadministration.  \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\nNo interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely \nlow (less than 0.2 ng/mL) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL eye drops, solution \n(multi-dose formulation). Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, \nand no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.  \n\nIn clinical studies, LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) was used concomitantly with a \nnumber of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.  \n\nConcomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not \nbeen evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy. \n\nThere is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be \nreduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin \nanalogues (see section 4.4). \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \n\nLUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nLUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular \ntreatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears \nbefore driving or using machines.  \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\nIn a 3 month clinical study, approximately 29% of patients treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-\ndose experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were conjuctival \nhyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a non-inflammatory nature) occurring in 24% of patients, and \neye pruritis occurring in 4% of patients. Approximately 0.7% of patients in the LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL \nsingle-dose group discontinued due to any adverse event in the 3 month study.  \nThe following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL \nsingle-dose or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious: \n\nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse \n\n\n\n21 \n\nreactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nTable 1 \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nNervous system disorders uncommon headache \n\nnot known dizziness \nEye disorders very common conjunctival hyperaemia \n\ncommon punctate keratitis, eye irritation, \nforeign body sensation, dry eye, \neye pain, eye pruritus, growth of \neyelashes, eyelid erythema\n\nuncommon asthenopia, conjunctival \noedema, photophobia, \nlacrimation increased, iris \nhyperpigmentation, blurred \nvision, eyelid pruritus, eyelid \noedema\n\nnot known eye discharge, ocular discomfort\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nnot known asthma, asthma exacerbation, \nCOPD exacerbation and \ndyspnoea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon skin hyperpigmentation \n(periocular) \n\nuncommon hair growth abnormal \nnot known skin discoloration (periocular) \n\nImmune system disorders not known Hypersensitivity reaction \nincluding signs and symptoms \nof eye allergy and allergic \ndermatitis \n\nVascular disorders not known hypertension \n\nIn clinical studies, over 1800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose \nformulation). On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) usage, the most frequently reported adverse reactions \nwere:  \n\n growth of eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing\nto 7% at 2 years and 2% at 3 years\n\n conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature)\nin up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13% at 2 years and\n12% at 3 years\n\n ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports\ndecreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years.\n\nLess than 9% of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of \nadditional patient discontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years. \n\nTable 2 lists adverse reactions that were seen in a 12 month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL \n(multi-dose formulation), but were reported at a higher frequency than with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL \n(single-dose). Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none were serious. \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 2  \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse Reaction \nNervous system disorders common headache \nEye disorders very common ocular pruritus, growth of \n\neyelashes \ncommon asthenopia, conjunctival \n\noedema, photophobia, tearing, \nincreased iris pigmentation; \nblurred vision \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\ncommon eyelid pruritus \n\nIn addition to the adverse reactions seen with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose, Table 3 lists \nadditional adverse reactions that were seen with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation). \nMost were ocular, mild to moderate, and none were serious. \n\nTable 3 \n\nSystem Organ class Frequency Adverse Reaction \nNervous system disorders uncommon dizziness \nEye disorders common corneal erosion, ocular burning, \n\nallergic conjunctivitis, \nblepharitis, worsening of visual \nacuity, eye discharge, visual \ndisturbance, eyelash darkening \n\nuncommon retinal haemorrhage, uveitis, \ncystoid macular oedema, iritis, \nblepharospasm, eyelid retraction \n\nnot known periorbital and lid changes \nincluding deepening of the \neyelid sulcus \n\nVascular disorders common hypertension \nGastrointestinal disorders uncommon nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nnot known periobital erythema \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nuncommon asthenia \n\nInvestigations common liver function test abnormal\n\nAdverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops: \nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nNo information is available on overdose in humans; overdose is unlikely to occur after ocular \nadministration.  \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-\ndose is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: In short term oral (by gavage) \nmouse and rat studies, doses up to 100 mg/kg/day of bimatoprost did not produce any toxicity. This \ndose is at least 22 times higher than an accidental dose of the entire content of a pack of LUMIGAN \n0.3 mg/mL single-dose (30 x 0.4 mL single-dose containers; 12 mL) in a 10 kg child.  \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, prostaglandin analogues, ATC code: S01EE03. \n\nMechanism of action \nThe mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by \nincreasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral \noutflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first \nadministration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of \neffect is maintained for at least 24 hours.  \n\nBimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to \nprostaglandin F2 (PGF2), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost \nselectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The \nprostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified. \n\nClinical efficacy \nA 12 week (double-masked, randomized, parallel group ) clinical study compared the efficacy and \nsafety of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation). \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose achieved non-inferior IOP-lowering efficacy to LUMIGAN 0.3 \nmg/mL (multi-dose formulation) for worse eye IOP change from baseline in patients with glaucoma or \nocular hypertension. LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose also achieved equivalent IOP lowering \nefficacy with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) in average eye IOP at each follow-up \ntimepoint at weeks 2, 6 and 12. \n\nDuring 12 months’ monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) in \nadults, versus timolol, mean change from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from \n-7.9 to -8.8 mmHg. At any visit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study\nperiod differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0\nmmHg.\n\nIn a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation), versus latanoprost, \na statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for \nbimatoprost versus –6.0 to -7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. \nConjunctival hyperaemia, growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher \nwith bimatoprost than with latanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were \nlow with no statistically significant difference. \n\nCompared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure \nby -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg.  \n\nLimited experience is available in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and \npigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy. \n\nNo clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \nBimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro. After ocular administration in \nadults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once \ndaily ocular administration of one drop of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL to both eyes for two weeks, blood \nconcentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of \ndetection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar \non days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 nghr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady \nbimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.  \n\nDistribution \nBimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in \nhumans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The \nplasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%.  \n\nBiotransformation \nBimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation \nfollowing ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to \nform a diverse variety of metabolites. \n\nElimination \nBimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered \nto healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The \nelimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the \ntotal blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.  \n\nCharacteristics in elderly patients \nAfter twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 nghr/ml \nbimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 nghr/ml \nin young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both \nelderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of \nbimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nMonkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of 0.3 mg/mL daily for 1 year had an \nincrease in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a \nprominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris \npigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and \nnot by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the \nperiocular effects were observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown.  \n\nBimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.  \n\nBimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the \nintended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental \neffects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the \ndose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times \nhigher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity \n\n\n\n25 \n\ncaused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at 0.3 mg/kg/day (at \nleast 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not \naffected.  \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,\n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side\n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml\n3. How to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is and what it is used for\n\nLUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides.  \n\nLUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its \nown or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure. \n\nYour eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being \ndrained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly \nenough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid \nthat is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could \nlead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml\n\nDo not use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml: \n- if you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section\n\n6).\n- if you have had to stop using eye drops in the past because of a side effect of the preservative\n\nbenzalkonium chloride.\n\nWarnings and precautions: \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml \nTalk to your doctor, if: \n\n- You have any breathing problems\n- You have liver or kidney problems\n- You have had a cataract surgery in the past\n- You have dry eye\n- You have or have had any problems with your cornea (front transparent part of the eye)\n- You wear contact lenses (see “LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride”)\n- You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate\n- You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye\n\n\n\n51 \n\nLUMIGAN may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to \ndarken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker over time. These changes may be permanent. \nThe change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nLUMIGAN has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore should not be used by \npatients under 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and LUMIGAN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \n\nLUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN. \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN. You should not drive or \nuse machines until your sight is clear again. \n\nLUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride \nThis medicine contains 0.6 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to \n0.2 mg/ml. \nDo not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses. A preservative in LUMIGAN, called \nbenzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the \ncontact lenses.  You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes \nafter using the drops before you put your lenses back in. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye \nirritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the \neye).  If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to \nyour doctor. \n\n3. How to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nLUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye. The recommended dose is one drop of LUMIGAN in \nthe evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment. \n\nIf you use LUMIGAN with another eye medicine, wait at least five minutes between using \nLUMIGAN and the other eye medicine. \n\nDo not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced. \n\nInstructions for use: \n\nYou must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it.  \n\n\n\n52 \n\n1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.\n\n2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.\n\n3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment.\n4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye for 30 seconds.\n\nWipe off any excess that runs down the cheek. \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\nTo help prevent infections and avoid eye injury, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or \nanything else. Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it. \n\nIf you use more LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml than you should \nIf you use more LUMIGAN than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your \nnext dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n\nIf you forget to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml  \nIf you forget to use LUMIGAN, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your \nregular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nIf you stop using LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml \nLUMIGAN should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN the pressure \ninside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose is and what it is used for\n\nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled prostamides.  \n\nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This \nmedicine may be used on its own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure. \n\nYour eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being \ndrained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly \nenough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid \nthat is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could \nlead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight. \n\nThis medicine does not contain a preservative. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose\n\nDo not use this medicine: \n- If you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in\n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to you doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose.  \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist, if: \n- You have any breathing problems\n- You have liver or kidney problems\n- You have had a cataract surgery in the past\n- You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate\n- You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye\n\n\n\n64 \n\nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin \naround the eyelid to darken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker over time. These changes \nmay be permanent. The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore \nshould not be used by patients under 18 years. \n\nOther medicines and LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\nLUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you \nare taking this medicine. \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose. \nYou should not drive or use machines until your sight is clear again. \n\n3.
