PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSilgard, suspension for injection.\nSilgard, suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe.\n\nPrior to agitation, Silgard may appear as a clear liquid with a white precipitate. After thorough \nagitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSilgard is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of:\n\u2013 premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), premalignant anal lesions, cervical \n\ncancers and anal cancers causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) \ntypes\n\n\u2013 genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types.\n\nSee sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication.\n\nThe use of Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals 9 to and including 13 years of age\nSilgard can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule (0.5 ml at 0, 6 months) (see section 5.1).\n\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nAlternatively, Silgard can be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule. \nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period.\n\nIndividuals 14 years of age and older\nSilgard should be administered according to a 3-dose (0.5 ml at 0, 2, 6 months) schedule.\n\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within \na 1-year period.\n\nThe use of Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Silgard in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No data \nare available (see section 5.1).\n\nIt is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Silgard complete the vaccination course \nwith Silgard (see section 4.4).\n\nThe need for a booster dose has not been established.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the deltoid area of \nthe upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.\n\nSilgard must not be injected intravascularly. Neither subcutaneous nor intradermal administration has \nbeen studied. These methods of administration are not recommended (see section 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n\nIndividuals who develop symptoms indicative of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of Silgard\nshould not receive further doses of Silgard.\n\nAdministration of Silgard should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile \nillness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or \nlow-grade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe decision to vaccinate an individual should take into account the risk for previous HPV exposure \nand potential benefit from vaccination.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in \ncase of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nSyncope (fainting), sometimes associated with falling, can occur following, or even before, any \nvaccination, especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be \naccompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia, and \ntonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Therefore, vaccinees should be observed for \napproximately 15 minutes after vaccine administration. It is important that procedures are in place to \navoid injury from faints.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Silgard may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. \n\nSilgard will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a \nlimited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types (see section 5.1). Therefore, \nappropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used.\n\nSilgard is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established clinical \ndisease. Silgard has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect. The vaccine is therefore not indicated \nfor treatment of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal dysplastic lesions or genital \nwarts. It is also not intended to prevent progression of other established HPV-related lesions.\n\nSilgard does not prevent lesions due to a vaccine HPV type in individuals infected with that HPV type \nat the time of vaccination (see section 5.1).\n\nThe use of Silgard in adult women should take into consideration the variability of HPV type \nprevalence in different geographical areas. \n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100% effective and \nSilgard will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, routine \ncervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations.\n\nSafety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have been assessed in individuals aged from 7 to 12 years \nwho are known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (see section 5.1).\nIndividuals with impaired immune responsiveness, due to either the use of potent immunosuppressive \ntherapy, a genetic defect, or other causes, may not respond to the vaccine.\n\nThis vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation \ndisorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.\n\nLong-term follow-up studies are currently ongoing to determine the duration of protection (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support change during vaccination with \nSilgard to other HPV vaccines which do not cover the same HPV types. Therefore, it is important that \nthe same vaccine should be prescribed for the whole dose regimen.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products during \nthe 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded. \n\nUse with other vaccines \n\nAdministration of Silgard at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a different injection site) as \nhepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interfere with the immune response to the HPV types. The \nseroprotection rates (proportion of individuals reaching seroprotective level anti-HBs >10 mIU/ml) \nwere unaffected (96.5% for concomitant vaccination and 97.5% for hepatitis B vaccine only). Anti-\nHBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co-administration, but the clinical significance of \nthis observation is not known.\n\nSilgard may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) \nand tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] \n(IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) with no significant interference with antibody response to \nany of the components of either vaccine. However, a trend of lower anti-HPV GMTs was observed in \nthe concomitant group. The clinical significance of this observation is not known. This is based on the \nresults from a clinical trial in which a combined dTap-IPV vaccine was administered concomitantly \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nwith the first dose of Silgard (see section 4.8).\n\nThe concomitant administration of Silgard with vaccines other than the ones above has not been \nstudied.\n\nUse with hormonal contraceptives\n\nIn clinical studies, 57.5% of women aged 16 to 26 years and 31.2% of women aged 24 to 45 years \nwho received Silgard used hormonal contraceptives during the vaccination period. Use of hormonal \ncontraceptives did not appear to affect the immune response to Silgard.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nSpecific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted. During the clinical \ndevelopment program, 3,819 women (vaccine = 1,894 vs. placebo = 1,925) reported at least one \npregnancy. There were no significant differences in types of anomalies or proportion of pregnancies \nwith an adverse outcome in Silgard and placebo treated individuals. These data on pregnant women \n(more than 1000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor feto/ neonatal toxicity.\n\nThe data on Silgard administered during pregnancy did not indicate any safety signal. However, these \ndata are insufficient to recommend use of Silgard during pregnancy. Vaccination should be postponed \nuntil completion of pregnancy. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIn breast-feeding mothers given Silgard or placebo during the vaccination period of the clinical trials \nthe rates of adverse reactions in the mother and the breast-fed infant were comparable between the \nvaccination and the placebo groups. In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable among \nbreast-feeding mothers and women who did not breast-feed during the vaccine administration.\n\nTherefore Silgard can be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). No effects on male fertility were observed in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nA. Summary of the safety profile\n\nIn 7 clinical trials (6 placebo-controlled), individuals were administered Silgard or placebo on the day \nof enrolment and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter. Few individuals (0.2%) discontinued due \nto adverse reactions. Safety was evaluated in either the entire study population (6 studies) or in a \npredefined subset (one study) of the study population using vaccination report card (VRC)-aided \nsurveillance for 14 days after each injection of Silgard or placebo. The individuals who were \nmonitored using VRC-aided surveillance included 10,088 individuals (6,995 females 9 to 45 years of \nage and 3,093 males 9 to 26 years of age at enrolment) who received Silgard and 7,995 individuals \n(5,692 females and 2,303 males) who received placebo. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions observed were injection-site adverse reactions (77.1% of \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nvaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit) and headache (16.6% of the vaccinees). \nThese adverse reactions usually were mild or moderate in intensity.\n\nB. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nClinical Trials\nTable 1 presents vaccine-related adverse reactions which were observed among recipients of Silgard at \na frequency of at least 1.0% and also at a greater frequency than observed among placebo recipients. \nThey are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:\n\n[Very Common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100); Rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000); Very Rare (\uf03c1/10,000)]\n\nPost-Marketing Experience\nTable 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been spontaneously reported during the\npost-marketing use of Silgard worldwide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccine exposure. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is \nqualified as \"not known\".\n\nTable 1: Adverse Events Following Administration of Silgard from Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing \nSurveillance\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Events\n\nInfections and infestations Not known Injection-site cellulitis *\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders\nNot known Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura*, \n\nlymphadenopathy*\nImmune system disorders Not known Hypersensitivity reactions including \n\nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions*\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache\n\nNot known Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis*, Dizziness1 *, \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome*, syncope sometimes \naccompanied by tonic-clonic movements*\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Nausea\nNot known Vomiting*\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nConnective Tissue Disorders\n\nCommon Pain in extremity\nNot known Arthralgia*, Myalgia*\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery common At the injection site: erythema, pain, swelling\n\nCommon Pyrexia\nAt the injection site: hematoma, pruritus\n\nNot known Asthenia*, chills*, fatigue*, malaise*\n\n* Post-Marketing adverse events (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).\n1 During clinical trials, dizziness was observed as a common adverse reaction in females. In males, dizziness was \nnot observed at a greater frequency in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients.\n\nIn addition, in clinical trials adverse reactions that were judged to be vaccine- or placebo-related by \nthe study investigator were observed at frequencies lower than 1%: \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:\nVery rare: bronchospasm.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nRare: urticaria.\nNine cases (0.06%) of urticaria were reported in the Silgard group and 20 cases (0.15%) were seen in \nthe adjuvant-containing placebo group.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nIn the clinical studies, individuals in the Safety Population reported any new medical conditions \nduring the follow-up. Among 15,706 individuals who received Silgard and 13,617 individuals who \nreceived placebo, there were 39 cases of non-specific arthritis/arthropathy reported, 24 in the Silgard\ngroup and 15 in the placebo group. \n\nIn a clinical trial of 843 healthy adolescent males and females 11-17 years of age, administration of the \nfirst dose of Silgard concomitantly with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, \ncomponent] and poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine showed that there was more injection-site \nswelling and headache reported following concomitant administration. The differences observed were \n< 10% and in the majority of subjects, the adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in \nintensity.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of Silgard. \n\nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single \ndoses of Silgard.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BM01\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nSilgard is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the highly \npurified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The \nVLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect cells, reproduce or cause disease. HPV only infects \nhumans, but animal studies with analogous papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of LI VLP \nvaccines is mediated by the development of a humoral immune response. \n\nHPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and \n75-80% of anal cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); \napproximately 70% of HPV related high-grade vulvar (VIN 2/3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/3) intraepithelial \nneoplasia and 80% of HPV related high-grade anal (AIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV 6 and 11 \nare responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical intraepithelial \nneoplasia (CIN 1). CIN 3 and AIS have been accepted as immediate precursors of invasive cervical \ncancer.\n\nThe term \"premalignant genital lesions\" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3) and high-\ngrade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3).\n\nThe term \"premalignant anal lesions\" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade anal intraepithelial \nneoplasia (AIN 2/3).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nThe indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Silgard in females 16 to 45 years of age \nand in males 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Silgard in 9- to \n15-year old children and adolescents.\n\nClinical Studies\n\nEfficacy in women 16 through 26 years\n\nThe efficacy of Silgard in 16- through 26-year-old women was assessed in 4 placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind, randomised Phase II and III clinical studies including a total of 20,541 women, who \nwere enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV infection.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions \n(genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade and cervical cancers (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), \nHPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS and cervical cancers (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, \n11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection and disease (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent \ninfection (Protocol 005). The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6,\n11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (i.e. all 3 vaccinations\nwithin 1 year of enrolment, no major protocol deviations and na\u00efve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior\nto dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).\n\nEfficacy results are presented for the combined analysis of study protocols. The efficacy for \nHPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), \n007, 013, and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. The \nmedian duration of follow-up for these studies was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 years for Protocol 005, \nProtocol 007, Protocol 013, and Protocol 015, respectively. The median duration of follow-up for the \ncombined protocols (005, 007, 013, and 015) was 3.6 years. Results of individual studies support the \nresults from the combined analysis. Silgard was efficacious against HPV disease caused by each of the \nfour vaccine HPV types. At end of study, individuals enrolled in the two Phase-III studies (Protocol-\n013 and Protocol-015), were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.7 years).\n\nCervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/3 (moderate to high-grade dysplasia) and \nadenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer.\n\nIn the long-term extension study of Protocol 015, 2,084 women 16-23 years old during vaccination \nwith Silgard in the base study, were followed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV \ntypes 6/11/16/18 related high grade CIN) were observed up to approximately 12 years. In this study, a \ndurable protection was statistically demonstrated to approximately 10 years.\n\nEfficacy in women na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s)\n\nEfficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit. Overall, 73% of women were na\u00efve (PCR \nnegative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV types at enrolment.\n\nThe efficacy results for relevant endpoints analysed at 2 years post-enrolment and at end of study \n(median duration of follow-up = 3.6 years) in the per-protocol population are presented in the Table 2.\n\nIn a supplemental analysis, the efficacy of Silgard was evaluated against HPV 16/18-related CIN 3 and \nAIS.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nTable 2: Analysis of efficacy of Silgard against high grade cervical lesions in the PPE population\nSilgard Placebo % \n\nEfficacy\nat 2 \n\nyears\n(95% \nCI)\n\nSilgard Placebo\n% \n\nEfficacy***\nat end of \n\nstudy\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nNumber of \ncases\n\nNumber of\nindividuals*\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated CIN \n2/3 or AIS\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n53\n\n8460\n\n100.0\n(92.9, \n100.0)\n\n2**\n\n8493\n\n112\n\n8464\n\n98.2\n(93.5, 99.8)\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated CIN 3\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n29\n\n8460\n\n100\n(86.5, \n100.0)\n\n2**\n\n8493\n\n64\n\n8464\n\n96.9\n(88.4, 99.6)\n\nHPV 16/18-\nrelated AIS\n\n0\n\n8487\n\n6\n\n8460\n\n100\n(14.8, \n100.0)\n\n0\n\n8493\n\n7\n\n8464\n\n100\n(30.6, \n100.0)\n\n*Number of individuals with at least one follow-up visit after Month 7\n**Based on virologic evidence, the first CIN 3 case in a patient chronically infected with HPV 52 is likely to be \ncausally related to HPV 52.

In the second CIN 3 case observed in a \npatient infected with HPV 51 at Day 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biopsy (in 1 of \n9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detected in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. \n***Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years)\nNote: Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.\n\nAt end of study and in the combined protocols, \n\uf0b7 the efficacy of Silgard against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN 1 was 95.9 % (95% CI: 91.4, \n\n98.4),\n\uf0b7 the efficacy of Silgard against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN (1, 2, 3) or AIS was 96.0% \n\n(95% CI: 92.3, 98.2), \n\uf0b7 the efficacy of Silgard against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN2/3 and VaIN 2/3 was 100% \n\n(95% CI: 67.2, 100) and 100% (95% CI: 55.4, 100), respectively,\n\uf0b7 the efficacy of Silgard against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related genital warts was 99.0% (95% CI: \n\n96.2, 99.9).\n\nIn Protocol 012 the efficacy of Silgard against the 6 month definition of persistent infection [samples \npositive on two or more consecutive visits 6 months apart (\u00b11 month) or longer] related to HPV 16 \nwas 98.7 % (95% CI: 95.1, 99.8) and 100.0% (95% CI: 93.2, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively, after a \nfollow-up of up to 4 years (mean of 3.6 years). For the 12 month definition of persistent infection, \nefficacy against HPV 16 was 100.0 % (95% CI: 93.9, 100.0) and 100.0 % (95% CI: 79.9, 100.0) for \nHPV 18 respectively.\n\nEfficacy in women with evidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 infection or disease at day 1\n\nThere was no evidence of protection from disease caused by vaccine HPV types for which women \nwere PCR positive at day 1.

The efficacy for HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 or \nAIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015. Patients were followed \nfor up to 4 years (median 3.6 years).\nNote: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.\n\nEfficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN 2/3 was 73.3% (95% CI: 40.3, 89.4), against \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VaIN 2/3 was 85.7% (95% CI: 37.6, 98.4), and against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, \n18-related genital warts was 80.3% (95% CI: 73.9, 85.3) in the combined protocols at end of study.\n\nOverall 12% of the combined study population had an abnormal Pap test suggestive of CIN at Day 1.\nAmong women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were na\u00efve to the relevant vaccine HPV types \nat Day 1, efficacy of the vaccine remained high. Among women with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 \nwho were already infected with the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, no vaccine efficacy was \nobserved.\n\nProtection Against the Overall Burden of Cervical HPV disease in 16- Through 26-Year-Old Women\n\nThe impact of Silgard against the overall risk for cervical, HPV disease (i.e., disease caused by any \nHPV type) was evaluated starting 30 days after the first dose in 17,599 individuals enrolled in the two \nphase III efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015). Among women who were na\u00efve to 14 common HPV \ntypes and had a negative Pap test at Day 1, administration of Silgard reduced the incidence of CIN 2/3 \nor AIS caused by vaccine- or non-vaccine HPV types by 42.7% (95% CI: 23.7, 57.3) and of genital \nwarts by 82.8% (95% CI: 74.3, 88.8) at end of study.\n\nIn the modified ITT population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of \nCIN 2/3 or AIS (caused by any HPV type) and of genital warts was much lower, with a reduction of \n18.4% (95% CI: 7.0, 28.4) and 62.5% (95% CI: 54.0, 69.5), respectively, as Silgard does not impact \nthe course of infections or disease that are present at vaccination onset.\n\nImpact on Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures \n\nThe impact of Silgard on rates of Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures regardless of causal HPV \ntypes was evaluated in 18,150 individuals enrolled in Protocol 007, Protocols 013 and 015. In the HPV \nna\u00efve population (na\u00efve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Silgard\nreduced the proportion of women who experienced a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop \nElectro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI: 27.7, 53.5) at end of study. \nIn the ITT population the corresponding reduction was 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2, 31.7).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nCross-protective efficacy\n\nThe efficacy of Silgard against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV \ntypes (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was \nevaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of \n3.7 years (at end of study). Efficacy against disease endpoints caused by pre-specified combinations of \nnon-vaccine HPV types was measured. The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against \ndisease caused by individual HPV types.\n\nThe primary analysis was done in type-specific populations that required women to be negative for the \ntype being analyzed, but who could be positive for other HPV types (96% of the overall population).\nThe primary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance for all pre-specified \nendpoints. The final end-of-study results for the combined incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS in this \npopulation after a median follow-up of 3.7 years are shown in Table 4. For composite endpoints, \nstatistically significant efficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV types phylogenetically \nrelated to HPV 16 (primarily HPV 31) whereas no statistically significant efficacy was observed for \nHPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45). For the 10 individual HPV types, \nstatistical significance was only reached for HPV 31.\n\nTable 4: Results for CIN 2/3 or AIS in Type-Specific HPV-Na\u00efve Individuals\u2020 (end of study results)\nNa\u00efve to \u2265 1 HPV Type\n\nComposite Endpoint\nSilgard Placebo\n\n% Efficacy 95% CIcases cases\n(HPV 31/45) \u2021 34 60 43.2% 12.1, 63.9\n\n(HPV 31/33/45/52/58) \u00a7 111 150 25.8% 4.6, 42.5\n10 non-vaccine HPV \n\nTypes\u2551\n162 211 23.0% 5.1, 37.7\n\nHPV-16 related types (A9 \nspecies)\n\n111 157 29.1% 9.1, 44.9\n\nHPV 31 23 52 55.6% 26.2, 74.1\u2020\n\nHPV 33 29 36 19.1% <0, 52.1\u2020\n\nHPV 35 13 15 13.0% <0, 61.9\u2020\n\nHPV 52 44 52 14.7% <0, 44.2\u2020\n\nHPV 58 24 35 31.5% <0, 61.0\u2020\n\nHPV-18 related types     \n(A7 species)\n\n34 46 25.9% <0, 53.9\n\nHPV 39 15 24 37.5% <0, 69.5\u2020\n\nHPV 45 11 11 0.0% <0, 60.7\u2020\n\nHPV 59 9 15 39.9% <0, 76.8\u2020\n\nA5 species (HPV 51) 34 41 16.3% <0, 48.5\u2020\n\nA6 species (HPV 56) 34 30 -13.7% <0, 32.5\u2020\n\u2020 The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types.\n\u2021 Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-related CIN 2/3 or AIS\n\u00a7 Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-, 33-, 52-, and 58-related CIN 2/3 or AIS\n\u2551 Includes assay-identified non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.  \n\nEfficacy in women 24 through 45 years\n\nThe efficacy of Silgard in 24- through 45-year-old women was assessed in 1 placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind, randomised Phase III clinical study (Protocol 019, FUTURE III) including a total of \n3,817 women, who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV \ninfection.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoints included the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related and \nthe combined incidence of HPV 16- or HPV 18-related persistent infection (6 month definition), \ngenital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers.

This assay measures antibodies \nagainst a single neutralizing epitope for each individual HPV type.\n\nImmune Responses to Silgard at 1 month post dose 3 \n\nIn the clinical studies in women 16 to 26 years of age, 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.5% of individuals \nwho received Silgard became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive,\nrespectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study in women 24 to 45 years, 98.4%, 98.1%, \n98.8%, and 97.4% of individuals who received Silgard became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, \nanti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3. In the clinical study \nin men 16 to 26 years, 98.9%, 99.2%, 98.8%, and 97.4% of individuals who received Silgard became \nanti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by 1 month \nPostdose 3. Silgard induced high anti-HPV Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) 1 month Postdose 3 in all \nage groups tested.\n\nAs expected for women 24 to 45 years of age (Protocol 019), the observed antibody titres were lower \nthan that seen in women 16 to 26 years.\n\nAnti-HPV levels in placebo individuals who had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15\n\nnegative) were substantially lower than those induced by the vaccine.

In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types \n6/11/16/18 related CIN any grade and Genital Warts) were observed through 10.7 years (median \nfollow-up of 10.0 years).\n\nBridging the Efficacy of Silgard from Men to Boys \n\nThree clinical studies (Protocols 016, 018 and 020) were used to compare the immunogenicity of \nSilgard in 9- to 15-year-old boys to 16- to 26-year-old men. In the vaccine group, 97.4 to 99.9% \nbecame seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3.\n\nTable 7 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9- to 15-year-old boys \nwith those in 16- to 26-year-old men. \n\nTable 7: Immunogenicity bridging between 9- to 15-year-old boys and 16- to 26-year-old men (per-\nprotocol population) based on titres as measured by cLIA\n\n9- to 15-Year-Old Boys 16- to 26-Year-Old Men\n\nn GMT (95% CI) n GMT (95% CI)\nHPV 6 884 1038 (964, 1117) 1093 448 (419, 479)\nHPV 11 885 1387 (1299, 1481) 1093 624 (588, 662)\nHPV 16 882 6057 (5601, 6549) 1136 2403 (2243, 2575)\nHPV 18 887 1357 (1249, 1475) 1175 403 (375, 433)\n\nGMT- Geometric mean titre in mMU/ml (mMU = milli-Merck units)\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16\n\nAnti-HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-year-old boys were non-inferior to anti-HPV \nresponses in 16- to 26-year-old men for whom efficacy was established in the Phase III studies. \nImmunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti-HPV levels were significantly higher in younger \nindividuals.\n\nOn the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Silgard in 9- to 15-year-old boys is \ninferred.\n\nIn the long-term extension study of Protocol 018, 326 boys 9-15 years old during vaccination with\nSilgard in the base study, were followed. In the PPE population, no cases of HPV diseases (HPV types \n6/11/16/18 related External Genital Lesions) were observed through 10.6 years (median follow-up of \n9.9 years).\n\nPersistence of Immune Response of Silgard\n\nA subset of individuals enrolled in the Phase III studies was followed up for a long-term period for \nsafety, immunogenicity and effectiveness. Total IgG Luminex Immunoassay (IgG LIA) was used to \nassess the persistence of immune response in addition to cLIA.\n\nIn all populations (women 9 \u2013 45 years, men 9 \u2013 26 years), peak anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, \nanti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs cLIA were observed at Month 7. Afterwards, the GMTs \ndeclined through Month 24 - 48 and then generally stabilized. The exact duration of immunity \nfollowing a 3-dose series has not been established and is currently being studied.\n\nGirls and boys vaccinated with Silgard at 9-15 years of age in Protocol 018 base study were followed \nup in an extension study. Depending on HPV type, 60-96% and 78-98% of subjects were seropositive \nby cLIA and IgG LIA respectively 10 years after vaccination (see Table 8).\n\nTable 8: Long-term immunogenicity data (per-protocol population) based on percentage of \nseropositive subjects as measured by cLIA and IgG LIA (Protocol 018) at 10 years, in girls and boys \n9-15 years of age\n\ncLIA IgG LIA\n\nn\n% of seropositive \n\nsubjects\nn % of seropositive subjects\n\nHPV 6 409 89% 430 93%\nHPV 11 409 89% 430 90%\nHPV 16 403 96% 426 98%\nHPV 18 408 60% 429 78%\n\nWomen vaccinated with Silgard at 16-23 years of age in Protocol 015 base study will be followed up \nto 14 years in an extension study. Nine years after vaccination, 94%, 96%, 99% and 60% were \nanti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and \n98%, 96%, 100% and 91% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive \nin the IgG LIA, respectively.\n\nWomen vaccinated with Silgard at 24-45 years of age in Protocol 019 base study were followed up  in \nan extension study. Ten years after vaccination, 79%, 85%, 94%, and 36% were anti-HPV 6, \nanti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 86%, 79%, \n100% and 83% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG \nLIA, respectively.\n\nMen vaccinated with Silgard at 16-26 years of age in Protocol 020 base study were followed up in an \nextension study. Ten years after vaccination, 79%, 80%, 95% and 40% were anti-HPV 6, \nanti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the cLIA, respectively, and 92%, 92%, \n100% and 92% were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seropositive in the IgG \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17\n\nLIA, respectively.\n\nIn these studies, individuals who were seronegative for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and \nanti-HPV 18 in the cLIA were still protected against clinical disease after a follow-up of 9 years for \n16-23 year-old women, 10 years for 24-45 year-old women, and 10 years for 16-26 year-old men.\n\nEvidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response\n\nEvidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated women who were seropositive to relevant \nHPV type(s) prior to vaccination. In addition, a subset of vaccinated women who received a challenge \ndose of Silgard 5 years after the onset of vaccination, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response \nthat exceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month Postdose 3. \n\nHIV-infected subjects\n\nAn academic study documenting safety and immunogenicity of Silgard has been performed in \n126 HIV infected subjects aged from 7 to 12 years (of which 96 received Silgard). Seroconversion to \nall four antigens occurred in more than ninety-six percent of the subjects. The GMTs were somewhat \nlower than those reported in non-HIV infected subjects of the same age in other studies. The clinical \nrelevance of the lower response is unknown. The safety profile was similar to non-HIV infected \nsubjects in other studies. The CD4% or plasma HIV RNA was not affected by vaccination.\n\nImmune Responses to Silgard using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9-13 years of age\n\nA clinical trial showed that among girls who received 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, \nantibody responses to the 4 HPV types, one month after the last dose were non-inferior to those among \nyoung women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months.\n\nAt Month 7, in the Per Protocol population, the immune response in girls aged 9-13 years (n = 241) \nwho received 2 doses of Silgard (at 0, 6 months) was non-inferior and numerically higher to the \nimmune response in women aged 16-26 years (n = 246) who received 3 doses of Silgard (at 0, 2, \n6 months).\n\nAt 36 month follow-up, the GMT in girls (2 doses, n = 86) remained non-inferior to the GMT in \nwomen (3 doses, n = 86) for all 4 HPV types.\n\nIn the same study, in girls aged 9-13 years, the immune response after a 2-dose schedule was \nnumerically lower than after a 3-dose schedule (n = 248 at Month 7; n = 82 at Month 36). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. A subset of the study participants from the 2-dose group \n(n=50) were followed 5-years post-vaccination (Month 60 Postdose 1). Among the girls receiving 2 \ndoses of the vaccine, 96%, 100%, 100%, and 84% remained seropositive to anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, \nanti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18, respectively, in the cLIA.\n\nDuration of protection of a 2-dose schedule of Silgard has not been established.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-dose and repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies revealed no special hazards to \nhumans.\n\nSilgard induced specific antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in pregnant rats, \nfollowing one or multiple intramuscular injections. Antibodies against all four HPV types were \ntransferred to the offspring during gestation and possibly during lactation.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Silgard is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Silgard\n3. How Silgard is given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Silgard\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Silgard is and what it is used for\n\nSilgard is a vaccine. Vaccination with Silgard is intended to protect against diseases caused by Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. \n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and vagina); pre-\ncancerous lesions of the anus and genital warts in males and females; cervical and anal cancers. HPV\ntypes 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80% of anal \ncancer cases; 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina; 75% of HPV related \npre-cancerous lesions of the anus. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of\ngenital wart cases. \n\nSilgard is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nSilgard does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Silgard can still protect against diseases associated with \nthe other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nSilgard cannot cause the diseases it protects against.\n\nSilgard produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent HPV 6-, 11-, \n16-, and 18-related diseases in women 16-45 years of age and in men 16-26 years of age. The vaccine \nalso produces type-specific antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. \n\nSilgard should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Silgard\n\nDo not receive Silgard if:\n\uf0b7 you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other \n\ningredients of Silgard (listed under \u201cother ingredients\u201d\u2013 see section 6).\n\uf0b7 you or your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Silgard. \n\uf0b7 you or your child suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper \n\nrespiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if you or your child\n\uf0b7 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia \n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system.\n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Silgard may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.\n\nSilgard will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nSilgard will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. You should continue to follow your \ndoctor\u2019s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Silgard\n\nThe duration of protection is currently unknown. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to \ndetermine whether a booster dose is needed. \n\nOther medicines or vaccines and Silgard\nSilgard can be given with a Hepatitis B vaccine or with a combined booster vaccine containing \ndiphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis \n[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of \nyour body, e.g. the other arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nSilgard may not have an optimal effect if:\n\uf0b7 used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nIn clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by \nSilgard.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have taken recently any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nSilgard may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n3. How Silgard is given\n\nSilgard is given as an injection by your doctor. Silgard is intended for adolescents and adults from \n9 years of age onwards.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 13 years of age\nSilgard can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n\uf0b7 First injection: at chosen date\n\uf0b7 Second injection: 6 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nAlternatively, Silgard can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n\uf0b7 First injection: at chosen date\n\uf0b7 Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n\uf0b7 Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose.

If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your \ndoctor for advice. When Silgard is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Silgard, and not with another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, Silgard can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Silgard:\n\nVery commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: pain, \nswelling and redness. Headache was also seen.\n\nCommonly (more than 1 in 100 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: bruising, \nitching, pain in extremity.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist.

How to store Silgard\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Silgard is and what it is used for\n\nSilgard is a vaccine. Vaccination with Silgard is intended to protect against diseases caused by Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. \n\nThese diseases include pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and vagina); pre-\ncancerous lesions of the anus and genital warts in males and females; cervical and anal cancers. HPV\ntypes 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80% of anal \ncancer cases; 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina; 75% of HPV related \npre-cancerous lesions of the anus. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of\ngenital wart cases. \n\nSilgard is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases. \nSilgard does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease \nassociated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected \nwith one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Silgard can still protect against diseases associated with \nthe other HPV types in the vaccine.\n\nSilgard cannot cause the diseases it protects against.\n\nSilgard produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent HPV 6-, 11-, \n16-, and 18-related diseases in women 16-45 years of age and in men 16-26 years of age. The vaccine \nalso produces type-specific antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. \n\nSilgard should be used in accordance with official guidelines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Silgard\n\nDo not receive Silgard if:\n\uf0b7 you or your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other \n\ningredients of Silgard (listed under \u201cother ingredients\u201d\u2013 see section 6).\n\uf0b7 you or your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Silgard. \n\uf0b7 you or your child suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper \n\nrespiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n46\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if you or your child\n\uf0b7 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example \n\nhaemophilia \n\uf0b7 has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or \n\nmedicines that affect the immune system. \n\nFainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle \ninjection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Silgard may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.\n\nSilgard will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate \nprecautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.\n\nSilgard will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.\n\nVaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. You should continue to follow your \ndoctor\u2019s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.\n\nWhat other important information should you or your child know about Silgard\n\nThe duration of protection is currently unknown. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to \ndetermine whether a booster dose is needed. \n\nOther medicines or vaccines and Silgard\nSilgard can be given with a Hepatitis B vaccine or with a combined booster vaccine containing \ndiphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis \n[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of \nyour body, e.g. the other arm or leg) during the same visit.\n\nSilgard may not have an optimal effect if:\n\uf0b7 used with medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nIn clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by \nSilgard.\n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have taken recently any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.\nSilgard may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n3. How Silgard is given\n\nSilgard is given as an injection by your doctor. Silgard is intended for adolescents and adults from \n9 years of age onwards.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47\n\nIf you are from 9 to and including 13 years of age\nSilgard can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:\n\uf0b7 First injection: at chosen date\n\uf0b7 Second injection: 6 months after first injection\nIf the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 6 months after the first dose, a third dose should \nalways be administered.\n\nAlternatively, Silgard can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:\n\uf0b7 First injection: at chosen date\n\uf0b7 Second injection: 2 months after first injection\n\uf0b7 Third injection: 6 months after first injection\nThe second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose \nshould be administered at least 3 months after the second dose.

If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your \ndoctor for advice. When Silgard is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course \nshould be done with Silgard, and not with another HPV vaccine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, Silgard can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe following side effects can be seen after the use of Silgard:\n\nVery commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: pain, \nswelling and redness.

warts in males and females; cervical and anal cancers. hpv types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases, 75-80% of anal cancer cases; 70% of hpv-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina; 75% of hpv related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. hpv types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital wart cases. silgard is intended to prevent these diseases. the vaccine is not used to treat hpv related diseases. silgard does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease associated with any of the hpv types in the vaccine. however, in individuals who are already infected with one or more of the vaccine hpv types, silgard can still protect against diseases associated with the other hpv types in the vaccine. silgard cannot cause the diseases it protects against. silgard produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent hpv 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related diseases in women 16-45 years of age and in men 16-26 years of age. the vaccine also produces type-specific antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. silgard should be used in accordance with

your child suffer from an illness with high fever. however, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if you or your child has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example haemophilia has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, hiv infection or medicines that affect the immune system. fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any

protect against every type of human papillomavirus. therefore appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used. silgard will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by human papillomavirus. vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. you should continue to follow your doctor's advice on cervical smear/pap tests and

body, e.g. the other arm or leg) during the same visit. silgard may not have an optimal effect if: used with medicines that suppress the immune system. in clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by silgard. please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have taken recently any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking
