NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nImmunoGam 312 IU/ml solution for injection. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml contains 312 IU Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, corresponding to a protein content \n\nof 30-70 mg/ml of which 96% is Immunoglobulin G (IgG). \n\n \n\nOne vial contains 312 IU of anti-HBs in 1 ml  \n\nOne vial contains 1560 IU of anti-HBs in 5 ml  \n\n \n\nThe immunoglobulin IgG subclasses are: \n\nIgG1:  64-67% \n\nIgG2:  25-27% \n\nIgG3:  7-9% \n\nIgG4:  0.1-0.3% \n\n \n\nIgA content is less than 40 micrograms/ml. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nImmunoGam is a clear to slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow liquid. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nImmunoprophylaxis of Hepatitis B \n\n \n\n- In case of accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects (including persons whose vaccination is \n\nincomplete or status unknown). \n\n \n\n- In haemodialysed patients, until vaccination has become effective. \n\n \n\n- In the newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother. \n\n \n\n- In subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after \n\nvaccination and for whom a continuous prevention is necessary due to the continuous risk of being \n\ninfected with hepatitis B. \n\n \n\nConsideration should also be given to other official guidance on the appropriate use of human hepatitis B \n\nimmunoglobulin for imtramuscular use. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\n- Prevention of hepatitis B in case of accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects: \n\nAt least 500 IU, depending on the intensity of exposure, as soon as possible after exposure, and preferably \n\nwithin 24 - 72 hours. \n\n \n\n- Immunoprophylaxis of hepatitis B in haemodialysed patients: \n\n8-12 IU/kg with a maximum of 500 IU, every 2 months until seroconversion following vaccination. \n\n \n\n- Prevention of hepatitis B in the newborn, of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother, at birth or as soon as \n\npossible after birth: \n\n30-100 IU/kg. The hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration may need to be repeated until \n\nseroconversion following vaccination. \n\n \n\nIn all these situations, vaccination against hepatitis B virus is highly recommended. The first vaccine dose can be \n\ninjected the same day as human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, however in different sites. \n\n \n\nIn subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after vaccination, and \n\nfor whom continuous prevention is necessary, administration of 500 IU to adults and 8 IU/kg to children every \n\n2 months can be considered; a minimum protective antibody titre is considered to be 10 mIU/ml. \n\n \n\nConsideration should also be given to dose and dose schedules for human hepatitis B immunoglobulin for \n\nintramuscular use recommended in other official guidance. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nImmunoGam should be administered via the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nIf a large volume (>2 ml for children or >5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended to administer this \n\nin divided doses at different sites. \n\n \n\nWhen simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two \n\ndifferent sites. \n\n \n\nIf intramuscular administration is contraindicated (bleeding disorders), the injection can be administered \n\nsubcutaneously if no intravenous medicinal product is available. However, it should be noted that there are \n\nno clinical efficacy data to support administration by the subcutaneous route. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to any of the components. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in very rare cases of IgA deficiency when the patient \n\nhas antibodies against IgA. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nEnsure that ImmunoGam is not administered into a blood vessel, because of the risk of shock. \n\n \n\nIf the recipient is a carrier of HBsAg, there is no benefit in administering this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nTrue hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  \n\n \n\nImmunoGam contains a small quantity of IgA (less than 40 micrograms/ml). Individuals who are deficient in \n\nIgA have the potential for developing IgA antibodies and may have anaphylactic reactions after administration \n\nof blood components containing IgA. The physician must therefore weigh the benefit of treatment with \n\nImmunoGam against potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions. \n\n \n\nRarely, human hepatitis B immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, even \n\nin patients who have tolerated previous treatment with immunoglobulin. \n\n \n\nSuspicion of allergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the injection. In case \n\nof shock, standard medical treatments for shock should be implemented. \n\n \n\nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human \n\nblood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations, and plasma pools for specific \n\nmarkers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. \n\nDespite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of \n\ntransmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and \n\nother pathogens. \n\n \n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. \n\n \n\nThe measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as HAV and parvovirus B19. \n\n \n\nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 transmission \n\nwith immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an important contribution to \n\nthe viral safety. \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time ImmunoGam is administered to a patient, the name and batch \n\nnumber of the medicinal product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \n\nof medicinal product. \n\n \n\nImmunoGam contains 0.16 g of maltose in a 500 IU dose. This should be taken into account in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines \n\nImmunoglobulin administration may interfere with the development of an immune response to live attenuated \n\nvirus vaccines such as rubella, mumps, measles and varicella for a period of 3 months. \n\n \n\nAfter administration of this medicinal product, an interval of at least 3 months should elapse before vaccination \n\nwith live attenuated virus vaccines. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\nHuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be administrated three to four weeks after vaccination with such \n\na live attenuated vaccine; in case administration of human hepatitis B immunoglobulin is essential within three \n\nto four weeks after vaccination, then revaccination should be performed three months after the administration of \n\nhuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin. \n\n \n\nInterference with testing \n\nSerological testing \n\nAfter injection of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the \n\npatient\u2019s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. \n\n \n\nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some serological tests \n\nfor red cell allo-antibodies (e.g.Coombs\u2019 test). \n\n \n\nBlood glucose testing \n\nSome types of blood glucose testing systems (for example, those based on the glucose dehydrogenase \n\npyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods) falsely interpret the maltose \n\ncontained in ImmunoGam as glucose. This may result in falsely elevated glucose readings and consequently \n\nin the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Also, cases of true \n\nhypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings. \n\nAccordingly, when administering ImmunoGam or other parenteral maltose-containing products, the \n\nmeasurement of blood glucose must be done with a glucose-specific method. The product information of the \n\nblood glucose testing systems, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if \n\nthe system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, the \n\nmanufacturer of the testing system should be contacted to determine if the system is appropriate for use with \n\nmaltose-containing parenteral products. \n\n \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical \n\ntrials. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, \n\nor on the fetus and the neonate are to be expected. \n\n \n\nLactation \n\nImmunoglobulins are excreted into milk but no harmful effects on the neonate are to be expected. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nIn general for immunoglobulin products, adverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic \n\nreactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally. \n\n \n\nRelated undesirable effects within 7 days of ImmunoGam administration, from clinical trials conducted using the \n\nintramuscular route of administration is tabulated below: \n\n \n\nMedDRA system organ class Undesirable effects \n\nADR frequency \n\ncategory* \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Uncommon  \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nVascular disorders Dizziness Uncommon  \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Uncommon  \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia, back pain, myalgia Uncommon  \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue, induration, malaise, pain, \n\npyrexia \n\nUncommon  \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n\n* Frequency has been evaluated using the following criteria: very common (\u22651/10), common \n\n(\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100). \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience: \n\nNo adverse events were reported in the post marketing use of ImmunoGam for Immunoprophylaxis of \n\nHepatitis B indication. \n\n \n\nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Hepatitis B immunoglobulin, ATC code: J06BB04 \n\n \n\nHuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a specifically high content of \n\nantibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nHuman hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use is bioavailable in the recipient\u2019s circulation after \n\na delay of 2 \u2013 3 days. \n\n \n\nImmunoGam has an elimination half-life of 3 \u2013 4 weeks. This half-life may vary from patient to patient. \n\nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in the reticuloendothelial system. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body. In animals, acute toxicity testing is of no \n\nrelevance as higher doses result in overloading. Repeated-dose toxicity testing and embryo-fetal toxicity \n\nstudies are impractical due to induction of, and interference with antibodies. Effects of the medicinal product \n\non the immune system of the newborn have not been studied. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

WHAT IMMUNOGAM IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \n\nWhat ImmunoGam is \n\nImmunoGam belongs to a group of medicines containing immunoglobulins (antibodies which can protect against \n\ncertain infections), which are present in your blood. ImmunoGam contains increased levels of human hepatitis B \n\nimmunoglobulins mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) and is obtained from blood plasma of screened donors from \n\nthe USA.  \n\n \n\nWhat ImmunoGam is used for \n\nImmunoGam provides protection against hepatitis B virus for a short period of time and it is used to treat the \n\nfollowing: \n\n- Accidental exposure in non-immunised subjects (including persons whose vaccination is incomplete or \n\nstatus unknown). \n\n- Haemodialysed patients, until vaccination has become effective. \n\n- Newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother. \n\n- Subjects who did not show an immune response (no measurable hepatitis B antibodies) after vaccination \n\nand for whom a continuous prevention is necessary due to the continuous risk of being infected with \n\nhepatitis B. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE IMMUNOGAM \n \n\nYou should NOT be given ImmunoGam  \n\n- if you have previously developed an allergic reaction to human immunoglobulins, to other blood products \nor to any of the other ingredients of ImmunoGam. \n\n- if you have an IgA deficiency such that you have developed an allergic reaction to IgA containing \nproducts \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n18 \n\nTake special care with ImmunoGam  \n\nGeneral warnings related to ImmunoGam: \n\n\uf0b7 Immunoglobulins in general may cause adverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, \nallergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia (joint pain), low blood pressure and moderate low back pain. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should be monitored for antibodies against human hepatitis B immunoglobulin regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin injections can induce a drop in blood pressure with an allergic \nreaction, even in patients who have tolerated previous treatments with immunoglobulin. Suspicion of \n\nallergic or anaphylactic type reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the injection. In case of \n\nshock, standard medical treatments for shock should be administered. \n\n\uf0b7 Immunoglobulin A: Please tell your doctor if your blood does not have immunoglobulin A (IgA). \nImmunoGam contains small amounts of IgA. Patients who have an IgA deficiency may develop \n\nan allergic reaction to this medicine.  \n\n\uf0b7 ImmunoGam contains maltose (10%w/w).  \n\n \n\nSerological Testing \n\nImmunoGam may cause a rise of various transferred antibodies which may result in misleading positive results \n\nof certain blood serum tests. Also transmission of antibodies to blood group antigens may interfere with some \n\nblood tests for red cell allo-antibodies (e.g. Coombs\u2019 test). \n\n \n\nBlood Glucose Testing \n\nBlood glucose testing: when administering ImmunoGam, the measurement of blood glucose must be done with \n\na glucose-specific method. This is because Some types of blood glucose testing systems falsely interpret the \n\nmaltose contained in ImmunoGam as glucose. This may result in falsely elevated glucose readings and \n\nconsequently in the inappropriate administration of insulin which may result in hypoglycemia. Also cases of true \n\nhypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings.\u201d \n\n \n\nViral Safety \n\nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections \n\nbeing passed from blood donors on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to \n\nmake sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma \n\nfor signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or \n\nplasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human \n\nblood or plasma are administered the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also \n\napplies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.  \n\n \n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \n\n(HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. \n\n \n\nThe measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus and \n\nparvovirus B19. \n\n \n\nImmunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly because the \n\nantibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of ImmunoGam, the name and batch number \n\nof the product are recorded in your physician\u2019s notes in order to maintain a record of the batches used.  \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n19 \n\nUsing other medicines \n\n\uf0b7 Please tell your doctor or nurse, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription e.g. herbal medicines. \n\n\uf0b7 Please inform your doctor if you are planning to receive a vaccine or have been recently vaccinated in \nthe last three months. This is because ImmunoGam may interfere with the response to some attenuated \n\nvaccines, such as measles, rubella, mumps, and chicken pox.  \n\n\uf0b7 There are no available data on drug interactions of ImmunoGam with other medications. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n\nYour doctor will decide if ImmunoGam can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nImmunoGam does not effect your ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of ImmunoGam \n\n \n\nImmunoGam contains 0.16 g of maltose in a 500 IU dose. This should be taken into account in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW IMMUNOGAM IS ADMINISTERED \n \n\nThe quantity of ImmunoGam you will need will be determined by your doctor or nurse. The table below \n\nprovides a recommended dose. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus is highly recommended. The first vaccine \n\ndose can be injected on the same day as human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, however in different sites. \n\n \n\nIndication Dose Frequency of Administration \n\nPrevention of hepatitis B in case of accidental \n\nexposure in non-immunised subjects \n\nAt least 500 IU depending on the intensity of exposure, as soon \n\nas possible after exposure, and preferably within \n\n24 - 72 hours \n\nImmunoprophylaxis of hepatitis B in \n\nhaemodialysed patients \n\n8-12 IU/kg with \n\na maximum of \n\n500 IU \n\nevery 2 months until seroconversion following \n\nvaccination. \n\nPrevention of hepatitis B in the newborn, of \n\na hepatitis B virus carrier-mother, at birth or \n\nas soon as possible after birth \n\n30-100 IU/kg The hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration \n\nmay need to be repeated until seroconversion \n\nfollowing vaccination \n\n \n\nInstructions for Use \n\nImmunoGam should be brought to room temperature (approximately 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C ) before use. The solution \n\nshould be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow essentially free of foreign particles. Do not \n\nuse solutions that are cloudy or have deposits.  \n\n \n\nFor intramuscular administration, ImmunoGam should be injected into the upper part of the shoulder \n\n(deltoid muscle), or into the right part of the thigh in the front (anteriolateral thigh) in newborn children.  \n\n \n\nIf a large volume (greater than 2 ml for children or greater than 5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended \n\nthat the administration of ImmunoGam be divided doses at different sites. \n\n \n\nWhen simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two \n\ndifferent sites. \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n20 \n\nIf more ImmunoGam is used than recommended  \n\nNo data is available in the event of an overdose. For intramuscular administration of ImmunoGam, the only \n\nmanifestations of overdose would be pain and tenderness at the injection site. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, ImmunoGam can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convension: \n\n- very common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \n\n- common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \n\n- uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \n\n- rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \n\n- very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n\n- not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n \n\nUndesirable effects reported during clinical trials with ImmunoGam, that was administered intramuscularly \n\n(injected into a muscle), were uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000). These undesirable effects were \n\nreported within the first 7 days after receiving ImmunoGam: nausea, fatigue, induration (swelling and firmness) \n\nat the injection site, feeling unwell, pain, fever, joint pain, back pain, muscle pain, headache and dizziness. \n\n \n\nThe following side effect can be serious and has been observed occasionally.  \n\n\uf0b7 Allergic reaction: There is a chance that you may experience an allergic reaction after administration of \nthis medicine. Please tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after \n\nreceiving ImmunoGam:  \n\no hives, flushed skin or rash, swelling of a specific area such as the injection site or face \no chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing  \no rapid increase in heart beat, sudden drop in blood pressure and/or shock  \n\nThese symptoms may be early signs of an allergic reaction. Depending on the nature and severity of the \n\nallergic reaction, your doctor may give you an additional treatment or your doctor may decide to stop the \n\ninjection immediately.  \n\n \n\nIn case of intramuscular administration, some discomfort may occur occasionally at the site of injection such as \n\nlocal pain or tenderness. In patients who have severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would \n\ncontraindicate intramuscular injections, ImmunoGam should be given only if the expected benefits outweigh the \n\npotential risks. \n\n \n\nIf any of the side effects mentioned in this leaflet gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet, please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n21 \n\n5.

solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow essentially free of foreign particles. do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. for intramuscular administration, immunogam should be injected into the upper part of the shoulder (deltoid muscle), or into the right part of the thigh in the front (anteriolateral thigh) in newborn children. if a large volume (greater than 2 ml for children or greater than 5 ml for adults) is required, it is recommended that the administration of immunogam be divided doses at different sites. when simultaneous vaccination is necessary, the immunoglobulin and the vaccine should be administered at two different sites. if more immunogam is used than recommended no data is available in the event of an overdose.

intramuscularly (injected into a muscle), were uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000). these undesirable effects were reported within the first 7 days after receiving immunogam: nausea, fatigue, induration (swelling and firmness) at the injection site, feeling unwell, pain, fever, joint pain, back pain, muscle pain, headache and dizziness. the following side effect can be serious and has been observed occasionally. allergic reaction: there is a chance that you may experience an allergic reaction after administration of this medicine. please tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after receiving immunogam: o hives, flushed skin or rash, swelling of a specific area such as the injection site or face o chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing o rapid increase in heart beat, sudden drop in blood pressure and/or shock these symptoms may be early signs of an allergic reaction. depending on the nature and severity of the allergic reaction, your doctor may give you an additional treatment or your doctor may decide to stop the injection immediately. in case of intramuscular administration, some discomfort may occur occasionally at the site of injection such as local pain or tenderness. in patients who have severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injections, immunogam should be given only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. if any of the side effects mentioned in this leaflet gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet,
