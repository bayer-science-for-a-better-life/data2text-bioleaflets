NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 200 mg film-coated tablets \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablet contains 200 mg of ribavirin \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nLight pink to pink, (debossed with “93” on one side and “7232” on the other). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection \nin adults, children 3-years of age or older and adolescents and must only be used as part of a \ncombination regimen with interferon alfa-2b. Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used.  \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e. \nnot alfa-2b). \n \nNaïve patients  \nAdult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for \nthe treatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not previously \ntreated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who are positive \nfor hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid HCV-RNA (see section 4.4).  \n \nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is \nindicated in a combination regimen with interferon alfa2b, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not \npreviously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.  \nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition, that may be irreversible in some patients. \nThe decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).  \n \nPrevious treatment failure patients  \nAdult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, for \nthe treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have previously responded (with \nnormalisation of ALT at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have \nsubsequently relapsed (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis C. \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must be used in combination therapy as described in section 4.1. \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of medicinal products \nused in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. for prescribing information particular to that \nproduct and for further dosage recommendations on co-administration with Ribavirin Teva Pharma \nB.V..  \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablets are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses \n(morning and evening) with food. \n \nAdults:  \nThe recommended dose and duration of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. depends on patient’s weight and \non the medicinal product that is used in combination. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of \nmedicinal products used in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V.. \nIn the cases in which no specific dose recommendation is made, the following dose should be used: \nPatient weight: < 75 kg =1,000 mg and > 75 kg = 1,200 mg. \n \nPaediatric population: \nNo data are available in children below 3 years of age. \n \nNote: For patients who weigh < 47 kg, or are unable to swallow tablets, ribavirin oral solution is \navailable and should be used if appropriate. \n \nDosing of ribavirin for children and adolescent patients is determined by the patient body weight. \n \nFor example, the body weight dosing used in conjunction with interferon alfa-2b is shown in Table 1. \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin as \nsome combination regimens do not adhere to the ribavirin dosing guidance provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1  Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. dose based on body weight when used in combination \nwith interferon alfa-2b in paediatric patients \n\nPatient weight (kg) Daily ribavirin dose Number of 200 mg tablets \n47-49 600 mg 3 x 200 mg tabletsa \n50-65 800 mg 4 x 200 mg tabletsb \n> 65 Refer to adult dose recommendation \n\na: 1 morning, 2 evening \nb: 2 morning, 2 evening \n \nDose modification for adverse reactions \n \nDose modification for adults \nDose reduction of ribavirin depends on the initial ribavirin posology which depends on the medicinal \nproduct that is used in combination with ribavirin. \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity.  \n \nTable 2 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient’s \nhaemoglobin concentration, cardiac status and indirect bilirubin concentration. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2 Management of Adverse Reactions \nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose* \n\nif: \nDiscontinue \nribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nNo Cardiac Disease \n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin: Patients with \nHistory of Stable Cardiac \nDisease \n \n\n 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any \n\n4 week period during treatment \n(permanent dose reduction) \n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\nBilirubin – Indirect > 5 mg/dL > 4 mg/dL (adults) \n  \n\n* For patients receiving a 1,000 mg (< 75 kg) or 1,200 mg (> 75 kg) dose, ribavirin dose should be \nreduced to 600 mg/day (administered as one 200 mg tablet in the morning and two 200 mg tablets in \nthe evening). If the abnormality is reversed, ribavirin may be restarted at 600 mg daily, and further \nincreased to 800 mg daily at the discretion of the treating physician. However, a return to higher doses \nis not recommended. \nFor patients receiving a 800 mg (< 65 kg) - 1,000 mg (65-80 kg) - 1,200 mg (81-105 kg) or 1,400 mg \n(> 105 kg) dose, 1st dose reduction of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is by 200 mg/day (except in \npatients receiving the 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2nd dose \nreduction of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg tablet in the morning and \ntwo 200 mg tablets in the evening. \n \nIn case of serious adverse reaction potentially related to medicinal products used in combination with \nribavirin, refer to the corresponding SmPC of these medicinal products as some combination regimens \ndo not adhere to the ribavirin dose modification and/or discontinuation guidelines as described in \nTable 2. \n \nDose modification for paediatric patients \nDose reduction in paediatric patients without cardiac disease follows the same guidelines as adult \npatients without cardiac disease regarding haemoglobin levels (Table 2). \n \nThere are no data for paediatric patients with cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n \nTable 3 provides guidelines for discontinuation based on the patient’s indirect bilirubin concentration. \n \nTable 3 Management of Adverse Reactions \nLaboratory values Discontinue ribavirin if:  \nBilirubin – Indirect \n \n\n> 5 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n(children and adolescents treated with interferon alfa-2b), \n\nor \n> 4 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n\n(children and adolescents treated with peginterferon alfa-2b) \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly ( 65 years of age) \nThere does not appear to be a significant age-related effect on the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin. \nHowever, as in younger patients, renal function must be determined prior to administration of ribavirin \n(see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents) \nRibavirin may be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b (see section 4.4). The selection of \nribavirin formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ribavirin used together with direct-acting-anti-virals in these patients has \nnot been established. No data are available. \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for \nfurther dosage recommendations on co-administration. \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, it is recommended that \nrenal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of ribavirin. Adult patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/minute) should be administered alternating daily \ndoses of 200 mg and 400 mg. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \n< 30 mL/minute) and patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or on haemodialysis should be \nadministered ribavirin 200 mg/day. Table 4 provides guidelines for dose modification for patients \nwith renal dysfunction. Patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with \nrespect to the development of anaemia. No data are available regarding dose modification for \npaediatric patients with renal impairment. \n \nTable 4 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment in Adult Patients \nCreatinine Clearance Ribavirin Dose (daily) \n30 to 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day \nLess than 30 mL/min 200 mg daily \nHaemodialysis (ESRD) 200 mg daily \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction appears between ribavirin and hepatic function (see section 5.2). For \nuse in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see the corresponding SmPC of the medicinal products \nused in combination with ribavirin. \n \nMethod of administration \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablets should be administered orally with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n- Pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). In females of childbearing potential, Ribavirin Teva \n\nPharma B.V. must not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained \nimmediately prior to initiation of therapy.  \n\n- Breast-feeding  \n- History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease, in the previous six months (see section 4.4).  \n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).  \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Ribavirin \nTeva Pharma B.V. for contraindications specific to these products. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRibavirin must be used in combination with other medicinal products (see section 5.1).  \nPlease refer to the SmPC of (peg)interferon alfa for details on the recommendations of monitoring and \nmanagement regarding the adverse reactions listed below before initiating therapy and other \nprecautions associated with (peg)interferon alfa. \n  \nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of ribavirin with \n(peg)interferon alfa. These include: \n\n\n\n6 \n\n- Severe psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal ideation, \nattempted suicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.) \n\n- Growth inhibition in children and adolescents that may be irreversible in some patients \n- Increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in children and adolescents \n- Severe ocular disorders \n- Dental and periodontal disorders. \n \nPaediatric population \nWhen deciding not to defer combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \nuntil adulthood, it is important to consider that this combination therapy induced a growth inhibition \nthat may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case. \n \nHaemolysis \nA decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dL was observed in up to 14 % of adult patients and 7 % \nof children and adolescents treated with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b in clinical trials. Although ribavirin has no direct cardiovascular effects, anaemia \nassociated with ribavirin may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of the \nsymptoms of coronary disease, or both. Thus, ribavirin must be administered with caution to patients \nwith pre-existing cardiac disease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start of \ntherapy and monitored clinically during therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be stopped \n(see section 4.2).  \n \nCardiovascular \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who \nhave pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course \nof treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy \nbut may require discontinuation of therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history \nof cardiac disease.  \n \nTeratogenic risk \nPrior to initiation of treatment with ribavirin the physician must comprehensively inform both male \nand female patients of the teratogenic risk of ribavirin, the necessity of effective and continuous \ncontraception, the possibility that contraceptive methods may fail and the possible consequences of \npregnancy should it occur during or following treatment with ribavirin (see section 4.6). For \nlaboratory monitoring of pregnancy, please refer to Laboratory tests. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity \nIf an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) \ndevelops, Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical \ntherapy instituted. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.  \n \nLiver function \nAny patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must be monitored \nclosely. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. for discontinuation or dose modification recommendations. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent clearance in these patients. Therefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in \nall patients prior to initiation of ribavirin. Due to substantial increases in ribavirin plasma \nconcentrations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, ribavirin dose adjustments are \nrecommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. No data are available \nregarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nHaemoglobin concentrations should be monitored closely during treatment and corrective action taken \nas necessary (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression \nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 \nweeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone (see section \n4.5). \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infection  \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: Caution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects \nco-infected with HCV who receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment \n(especially ddI and d4T) and associated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive \npopulation receiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial \ntoxicity and lactic acidosis when ribavirin is administered. For additional details see section 4.5.  \n \nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) may \nbe at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Other baseline factors in co-infected patients \nthat may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine \nand elevated bilirubin serum concentrations.  \nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC \nof medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for discontinuation or dose modification \nrecommendations. Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis \ntreatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:  \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and cART may be at \nincreased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with ribavirin and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, \nthe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with low CD4 counts: \nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µL. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts.  \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with ribavirin.  \n \nLaboratory tests \nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) and pregnancy tests must be \nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered \nas a guideline prior to initiation of ribavirin therapy:  \n \nHaemoglobin Adult: ≥ 12 g/dL (females); ≥ 13 g/dL (males)  \n\nChildren and adolescents: ≥ 11 g/dL (females); ≥ 12 g/dL (males)  \n \nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nUric acid may increase with ribavirin due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for development of \ngout must be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of ribavirin. Ribavirin does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. There is no evidence from toxicity studies that ribavirin induces liver enzymes. \nTherefore, there is a minimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions.  \n \nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \nazathioprine. The use of pegylated alpha interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine \nshould be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done \nduring concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with \nthese medicines should be stopped (see section 4.4). \n \nNo interaction studies have been conducted with ribavirin and other medicinal products, except for \npeginterferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b and antacids.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.  \n \nAntacid \nThe bioavailability of ribavirin 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing \nmagnesium aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14 %. It is possible that the decreased \nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. This interaction is \nnot considered to be clinically relevant.  \n \nNucleoside analogues \nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \nacidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see section 4.4).  \nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section \n4.4).Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with  a \nknown history of zidovudine induced anaemia. \n \nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for ribavirin) after \ncessation of ribavirin therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).  \n \nThere is no evidence that ribavirin interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \nprotease inhibitors.  \n \nConflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and ribavirin. \nSome data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at \n\n\n\n9 \n\nrisk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Caution should be exercised \nwhen both medicines are co-administered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n \nFemale patients  \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n5.3). Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Ribavirin \ntherapy must not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately \nprior to initiation of therapy. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for four months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy \ntests must be performed during this time (see section 4.4). If pregnancy does occur during treatment or \nwithin four months from stopping treatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic \nrisk of ribavirin to the foetus (see section 4.4).  \n \nMale patients and their female partners \nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of male patients taking Ribavirin Teva \nPharma B.V. (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). Ribavirin accumulates intracellularly and is cleared from \nthe body very slowly. It is unknown whether the ribavirin that is contained in sperm will exert its \npotential teratogenic or genotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus. Although data on \napproximately 300 prospectively followed pregnancies with paternal exposure to ribavirin have not \nshown an increased risk of malformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern \nof malformation, either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to \nuse an effective contraceptive during treatment with ribavirin and for seven months after treatment. \nRoutine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time. Men whose partners are \npregnant must be instructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of ribavirin to the partner.  \n \nPregnancy \nThe use of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is contraindicated during pregnancy. Ribavirin has been \nshown in preclinical studies to be teratogenic and genotoxic (see section 4.4 and 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether ribavirin is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse \nreactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data:  \n- Fertility: In animal studies, ribavirin produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see section \n\n5.3).  \n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \n\nribavirin in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at \ndoses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3).  \n\n- Genotoxicity: Ribavirin induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; \nhowever, other medicinal products used in combination may have an effect. Thus, patients who \ndevelop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or \noperating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe salient safety issue of ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia occurring within the first weeks of therapy. \nThe haemolytic anaemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac \nfunction and/or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease. An increase in uric acid and indirect \nbilirubin values associated with haemolysis were also observed in some patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in this section are primarily derived from clinical trials and/or as adverse \ndrug reactions from spontaneous reports when ribavirin was used in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products that are used in combination with \nribavirin for additional undesirable effects reported with these products. \n \nAdults \nThe safety of ribavirin is evaluated from data from four clinical trials in patients with no previous \nexposure to interferon (interferon-naïve patients): two trials studied ribavirin in combination with \ninterferon alfa-2b, two trials studied ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.  \n \nPatients who are treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin after previous relapse from interferon \ntherapy or who are treated for a shorter period are likely to have an improved safety profile than that \ndescribed below.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions for adults \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on experience from clinical trials in adult naïve \npatients treated for 1 year and post-marketing use. A certain number of adverse reactions, generally \nattributed to interferon therapy but that have been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (in \ncombination with ribavirin) are also listed for reference in Table 5. Also, refer to peginterferon alfa-2b \nand interferon alfa-2b SPCs for adverse reactions that may be attributable to interferon monotherapy. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of

There \nwere some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of \n186 [7 %]); WHO grade 3 leukopenia was also reported in 7 % of this treatment group.  \n \nAn increase in uric acid and indirect bilirubin values associated with haemolysis was observed in some \npatients treated with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b in clinical trials, but values returned to baseline levels by four weeks after the end of \ntherapy. Among those patients with elevated uric acid levels, very few patients treated with the \ncombination developed clinical gout, none of which required treatment modification or \ndiscontinuation from the clinical trials.  \n \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other \nadverse reactions (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nstudies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), CD4 \nlymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9 %), \nback pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic hepatitis \n(6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).   \n \nMitochondrial toxicity \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated-ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).  \n \nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients \nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon \nalfa-2b when compared to patients receiving ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b. In Study \n1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in \n4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of \npatients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. Anaemia a (haemoglobin < 9.4 \ng/dL) was reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with ribavirin in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nCD4 lymphocytes decrease \nTreatment with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b was associated with decreases in \nabsolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The \ndecrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of \n\n\n\n14 \n\nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b had no observable negative impact on the control \nof HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N = 25) are available in co-infected \npatients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µL (see section 4.4).  \nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with Ribavirin Teva \nPharma B.V in combination with other medicinal products.  \n \nPaediatric population: \nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % \nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted \nin reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients). \n \nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20% of the children continued \nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety four of 107 children enrolled in the \n5 year long-term follow up trial. The effects on growth were less in those children treated for 24 weeks \nthan those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow up among children \ntreated for 24 or 48 weeks, height for age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 9.0 percentiles, respectively. \nTwenty four percent of children (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of children (19/48) treated for \n48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height for age decrease from pre-treatment to the end of 5 year long \nterm follow up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of children (5/46) \ntreated for 24 weeks and 13 % of children (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed to have a \ndecrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30 height for age percentiles to the end of the 5 year long term \nfollow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long term follow up, weight for age percentiles \ndecreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. For \nBMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow up, BMI for age percentiles decreased 1.8 and 7.5 \npercentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. Decrease in mean height \npercentile at year 1 of long term follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children. The \ndecline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the treatment phase in comparison to a \nnormative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term follow-up period for children \ntreated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site \nerythema (29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction \n(thrombocytopenia). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in \nseverity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection \nsite pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). \nImportant treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were \nnervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and \nhypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated \nTSH.  \n  \nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b \nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age treated with combination therapy \nof interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse events. In general, the \n\n\n\n15 \n\nadverse event profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 percentile) and weight \npercentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the \n5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was \nbelow the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height \n(48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of \nwhom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of \ntreatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of \nthose children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 \nyears after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-\n2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some \npatients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term \nfollow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). \n \nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropenia.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in paediatric population \nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 6 are based on experience from the two multicentre \nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using ribavirin with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 6 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical \n\ntrials in children and adolescents with ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions \nInfections and infestations \nVery common: Viral infection, pharyngitis \nCommon: Fungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, \n\nnasopharyngitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, \nsinusitis, tooth abscess, influenza, oral herpes, herpes \nsimplex, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, gastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm unspecified \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Anaemia, neutropenia \nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy \nEndocrine disorders \nVery common: Hypothyroidism \nCommon: Hyperthyroidism, virilism \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia, increased appetite, decreased appetite \nCommon: Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: Depression, insomnia, emotional liability \n\n\n\n16 \n\nCommon: Suicidal ideation, aggression, confusion, affect liability, \nbehaviour disorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, mood \naltered, restlessness, nervousness, sleep disorder, abnormal \ndreaming, apathy \n\nUncommon:  Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, \nfear, nightmare \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache, dizziness \nCommon: Hyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, \nsomnolence, disturbance in attention, poor quality of sleep \n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland \n\ndisorder \nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision \n\nblurred, photophobia \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, palpitations \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Pallor, flushing \nUncommon: Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, \n\nnasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, pharyngolaryngeal \npain \n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort \nGastro-intestinal disorders \nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting , \n\ndiarrhoea, nausea \nCommon: Mouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, aphthous \n\nstomatitis, dyspepsia, cheilosis, glossitis, gastroesophageal \nreflux, rectal disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, \nconstipation, loose stools, toothache, tooth disorder, \nstomach discomfort, oral pain \n\nUncommon: Gingivitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal \nUncommon: Hepatomegaly \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common: Alopecia, rash \nCommon: Pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, \n\nhyperhidrosis, eczema, acne, skin disorder, nail disorder, \nskin discolouration, dry skin, erythema, bruise \n\nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin exfoliation \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nCommon: Pain in extremity, back pain, muscle contracture \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence, \n\nproteinuria \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n\n\n17 \n\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, \nvaginal disorder, Male: testicular pain \n\nUncommon: Female: dysmenorrhoea \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue, rigors, pyrexia, influenza-like illness, asthenia, \n\nmalaise, irritability \nCommon: Chest pain, oedema, pain, feeling cold \nUncommon: Chest discomfort, facial pain \nInvestigations \nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for \n\nage) \nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin \n\nincreased \nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nCommon: Skin laceration \nUncommon: Contusion \n \nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the ribavirin/peginterferon alfa-2b clinical trial were mild \nor moderate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, nucleosides and nucleotides excl.reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AB04.  \n \nMechanism of action \nRibavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity against some RNA and \nDNA viruses. The mechanism by which ribavirin in combination with other medicinal products exerts \nits effects against HCV is unknown. Oral formulations of ribavirin monotherapy have been \ninvestigated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in several clinical trials. Results of these investigations \nshowed that ribavirin monotherapy had no effect on eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or \nimproving hepatic histology after 6 to 12 months of therapy and 6 months of follow-up.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n18 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe use of ribavirin in combination treatment with interferon alfa-2b was evaluated in a number of \nclinical trials. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive \nHCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 30 IU/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a \nhistological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal \nserum ALT.  \n \nNaïve patients  \nThree trials examined the use of interferon in naïve patients, two with ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b \n(C95-132 and I95-143) and one with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b (C/I98-580). In all cases the \ntreatment was for one year with a follow-up of six months. The sustained response at the end of \nfollow-up was significantly increased by the addition of ribavirin to interferon alfa-2b (41 % vs 16 %, \np < 0.001).  \n \nIn clinical trials C95-132 and I95-143, ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination therapy proved to be \nsignificantly more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (a doubling in sustained response). \nCombination therapy also decreased the relapse rate. This was true for all HCV genotypes.  \n \nIn clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following \ncombination regimens:  \n Ribavirin (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n = 511).  \n Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one \n\nmonth followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n = 514). \n Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n = 505).  \n \nIn this trial, the combination of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) was \nsignificantly more effective than the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b, particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1. Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months \nafter the cessation of treatment.  \n \nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. \nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \nadministered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that \nreceived > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral \nload, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg \nribavirin (Table 7), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even \nhigher.  \n \nTable 7  Sustained response rates with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b  \n  (by ribavirin dose [mg/kg], genotype and viral load)  \nHCV Genotype  Ribavirin dose \n\n(mg/kg) \nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R \n\nAll Genotypes  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n54 % \n50 % \n61 % \n\n47 % \n41 % \n48 % \n\n47 % \n27 % \n47 % \n\nGenotype 1  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n42 % \n38 % \n48 % \n\n34 % \n25 % \n34 % \n\n33 % \n20 % \n34 % \n\nGenotype 1  ≤ 600,000 \nIU/mL  \n\nAll \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n73 % \n74 % \n71 % \n\n51 % \n25 % \n52 % \n\n45 % \n33 % \n45 % \n\n Genotype 1 > 600,000 \nIU/mL  \n\nAll \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n30 % \n27 % \n37 % \n\n27 % \n25 % \n27 % \n\n29 % \n17 % \n29 % \n\n\n\n19 \n\nGenotype 2/3  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n82 % \n79 % \n88 % \n\n80 % \n73 % \n80 % \n\n79 % \n50 % \n80 % \n\nP1.5/R   Ribavirin (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg)  \nP0.5/R   Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg)  \nI/R   Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. The response to treatment \nin both of these trials is presented in Table 8. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either ribavirin (800 mg/day) plus \npeginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) or ribavirin (800 mg/day) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) \nfor 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-\ninfected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on \nweight) plus peginterferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 µg/week based on weight) or ribavirin (800 \n-1,200 mg/day based on weight) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW). The duration of therapy was 48 \nweeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral \nload < 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6 month follow-up period.  \n \nTable 8 Sustained virological response based on genotype after ribavirin in combination \n\nwith peginterferon alfa-2b in HCV/HIV co-infected patients  \n \n\n Study 11  Study 22   \n \n\nRibavirin \n(800 mg/day) \n+ \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b (1.5 \nµg /kg/ week) \n\nRibavirin \n(800 mg/day) + \ninterferon alfa-\n2b (3 MIU \nTIW) p \n\nvaluea  \n\nRibavirin \n(800-\n1,200 mg/day) \nd + \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b (100 \nor 150c \nµg/week) \n\nRibavirin \n(800-\n1,200 mg/day) \nd + interferon \nalfa-2b \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\np \nvalueb  \n\nAll  27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype  \n1, 4  \n\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype  \n2, 3  \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.  \na: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.  \nb: p value based on chi-square test.  \nc: subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week peginterferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week peginterferon \nalfa-2b .  \nd: Ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.  \n1\nCarrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.  \n\n \nHistological response  \nLiver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the \n412 subjects (51 %). Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with \nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. This decline was significant among responders \n(-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among \nnon-responders. In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and \nnone showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. \nSteatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.   \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nRetreatment of relapse patients with Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment  \nTwo trials examined the use of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse \npatients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous \ninterferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up. Combination therapy \nwith ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b resulted in a sustained virological response that was ten-fold \nhigher than that with interferon alfa-2b alone (49 % vs 5 %, p < 0.0001). This benefit was maintained \nirrespective of standard predictors of response to interferon alfa-2b such as virus level, HCV genotype \nand histological staging.  \n \nLong-term efficacy data - Adults \nTwo large long-term follow-up studies enrolled 1,071 patients and 567 patients after treatment in prior \nstudies with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) and pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b (with or without ribavirin), respectively. The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the durability \nof sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical \noutcomes. At least 5 years of long-term follow-up was completed after treatment in 462 patients and \n327 patients, respectively. Twelve out of 492 sustained responders and only 3 out of 366 sustained \nresponders relapsed, respectively, in the studies. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 97 % (95 % CI: 95-99 %) \nfor patients receiving nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin), and is 99 % (95 % \nCI: 98-100 %) for patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin). \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated, with or \nwithout ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic \ninfection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of \nhepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 \ntimes a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment. A total of 118 patients were \nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population \nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials \nsustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to \nthe lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon \nalfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).  \nThe study results are summarized in Table 9.  \n \nTable 9.

Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period \n \nLong-term efficacy data \nRibavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in a multicentre trial. Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin \ntreatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained \nresponders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR relapsed during the 5 years of \nfollow-up.  \n \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in two previously mentioned multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. \n \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax=1.5 hours), \nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively). Absorption is extensive with \napproximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces. However, absolute bioavailability \nis approximately 45 %-65 %, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism. There is a linear \nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin. Volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins.  \n \nDistribution \nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and \nhas been identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of \ntransporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of \nribavirin. The ratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess \nof ribavirin in whole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes.  \n \nBiotransformation \nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite. \nBoth ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted \nrenally.  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter  and intra subject pharmacokinetic variability \nfollowing single oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30 % for both AUC and Cmax), \nwhich may be due to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood \ncompartment. \n \nElimination \nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of \nmultiple-dose to single-dose AUC12hr. Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was \nreached by approximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately \n2,200 ng/mL. Upon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which \nprobably reflects slow elimination from non-plasma compartments.  \n \nTransfer into seminal fluid \nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. \n \nFood effect \nThe bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration of a high fat \nmeal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70 %). It is possible that the increased bioavailability in this \nstudy was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. The clinical relevance of results from this \nsingle dose study is unknown. In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, patients were instructed to take \nribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of ribavirin.  \n \nRenal function \nBased on published data, single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics was altered (increased AUCtf and \nCmax) in patients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance > \n90 mL/minute). The mean AUCtf was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance between \n10 and 30 mL/min compared with control subjects. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 \nand 50 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater compared with control subjects. This appears to be due to \nreduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations are essentially unchanged \nby haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic function \nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \ndysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) is similar to those of normal controls.  \n \nOlder people (≥ 65 years of age) \nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not been performed. However, in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic study, age was not a key factor in the kinetics of ribavirin; renal function \nis the determining factor.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using sparsely sampled serum concentration \nvalues from four controlled clinical trials. The clearance model developed showed that body weight, \ngender, age, and serum creatinine were the main covariates. For males, clearance was approximately \n20 % higher than for females. Clearance increased as a function of body weight and was reduced at \nages greater than 40 years. Effects of these covariates on ribavirin clearance appear to be of limited \nclinical significance due to the substantial residual variability not accounted for by the model.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 10. The \n\n\n\n23 \n\npharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) is similar in adults and children \nor adolescents.  \n \nTable 10.

Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, \nlimbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects \nincreased with escalation of the dose. Survival of foetuses and offspring was reduced.  \n \nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length. At the end of the recovery \nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \ncontrols. No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed \nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development. Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose.  \n \nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies. Anaemia occurs shortly \nafter initiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment.  \nIn 3- and 6-month studies in mice to investigate ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \nabnormalities in sperm, occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above. These doses in animals produce \nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses. Upon cessation of \ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or \ntwo spermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6).  \n \nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity. Ribavirin \nwas active in the Balb/3T3 in vitro transformation assay. Genotoxic activity was observed in the \nmouse lymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay. A dominant \nlethal assay in rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted \nthrough male gametes.  \n \nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under \ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin. In \naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure). These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely.  \n \nRibavirin plus interferon \n\n\n\n24 \n\nWhen used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin did not cause any \neffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was \na reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either \nactive substance alone. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 400 mg film coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablet contains 400 mg of ribavirin \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nLight pink to pink, (debossed with “R” on one side and “400” on the other). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection \nin adults, children 3-years of age or older and adolescents and must only be used as part of a \ncombination regimen with interferon alfa-2b. Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used.  \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e. \nnot alfa-2b). \n \nNaïve patients  \n Adult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, \n\nfor the treatment of adult patients with all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1 , not \npreviously treated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT), who are positive for hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid HCV-RNA (see section 4.4).  \n\n \nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older  and adolescents: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. \nis indicated, in a combination regimen with interferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of children and \nadolescents 3 years of age and older, who have all types of chronic hepatitis C except genotype 1, not \npreviously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA.  \nWhen deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination \ntherapy induced a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat \nshould be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevious treatment failure patients  \n Adult patients: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated, in combination with interferon alfa-2b, \n\nfor the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have previously responded (with \nnormalisation of ALT at the end of treatment) to interferon alpha monotherapy but who have \nsubsequently relapsed.(see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated, and monitored, by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis C. \n \nPosology  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must be used in combination therapy as described in section 4.1. \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of medicinal products \nused in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. for prescribing information particular to that \nproduct and for further dosage recommendations on co-administration with Ribavirin Teva Pharma \nB.V.. \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablets are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses \n(morning and evening) with food. \n \nAdults:  \nThe recommended dose and duration of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. depends on patient’s weight and \non the medicinal product that is used in combination. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of \nmedicinal products used in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V.. \nIn the cases in which no specific dose recommendation is made, the following dose should be used: \nPatient weight: < 75 kg =1,000 mg and > 75 kg = 1,200 mg. \n \nPaediatric population: \nNo data are available in children below 3 years of age. \n \nNote: For patients who weigh <47 kg, or are unable to swallow tablets, ribavirin oral solution is \navailable and should be used if appropriate. \n \nDosing of ribavirin for children and adolescent patients is determined by the patient body weight. \n \nFor example, the body weight dosing used in conjunction with interferon alfa-2b is shown in Table 1. \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin as \nsome combination regimens do not adhere to the ribavirin dosing guidance provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1  Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. dose based on body weight when used in combination \nwith interferon alfa-2b in paediatric patients \n\nPatient weight (kg) Daily ribavirin dose Number of 200 mg tablets* \n47-49 600 mg 3 x 200 mg tabletsa \n50-65 800 mg 4 x 200 mg tabletsb \n> 65 Refer to adult dose recommendation \n\na: 1 morning, 2 evening \nb: 2 morning, 2 evening \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 400 mg Tablets \n*Nb: for 800 mg daily dose, 2 x 200 mg tablets can be substituted for 1 x 400 mg tablet. \n \nDose modification for adverse reactions \n \nDose modification for adults \nDose reduction of ribavirin depends on the initial ribavirin posology which depends on the medicinal \nproduct that is used in combination with ribavirin. \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity.  \n \nTable 2 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient’s \nhaemoglobin concentration, cardiac status and indirect bilirubin concentration. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nTable 2 Management of Adverse Reactions \nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose* \n\nif: \nDiscontinue \nribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nNo Cardiac Disease \n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin: Patients with \nHistory of Stable Cardiac \nDisease \n \n\n 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any \n\n4 week period during treatment \n(permanent dose reduction) \n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\nBilirubin – Indirect > 5 mg/dL > 4 mg/dL (adults) \n* For patients receiving a 1,000 mg (< 75 kg) or 1,200 mg (> 75 kg) dose, ribavirin dose should be \nreduced to 600 mg/day (administered as one 200 mg tablet in the morning and two 200 mg tablets in \nthe evening). If the abnormality is reversed, ribavirin may be restarted at 600 mg daily, and further \nincreased to 800 mg daily at the discretion of the treating physician. However, a return to higher doses \nis not recommended. \nFor patients receiving a 800 mg (< 65 kg) - 1,000 mg (65-80 kg) - 1,200 mg (81-105 kg) or 1,400 mg \n(> 105 kg) dose, 1st dose reduction of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is by 200 mg/day (except in \npatients receiving the 1,400 mg, dose reduction should be by 400 mg/day). If needed, 2nd dose \nreduction of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is by an additional 200 mg/day. Patients whose dose of \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg tablet in the morning and \ntwo 200 mg tablets in the evening. \n \nIn case of serious adverse reaction potentially related to medicinal products used in combination with \nribavirin, refer to the corresponding SmPC of these medicinal products as some combination regimens \ndo not adhere to the ribavirin dose modification and/or discontinuation guidelines as described in \nTable 2. \n \nDose modification for paediatric patients \nDose reduction in paediatric patients without cardiac disease follows the same guidelines as adult \npatients without cardiac disease regarding haemoglobin levels (Table 2). \n \nThere are no data for paediatric patients with cardiac disease (see section 4.4). \n \nTable 3 provides guidelines for discontinuation based on the patient’s indirect bilirubin concentration. \n \nTable 3 Management of Adverse Reactions \nLaboratory values Discontinue ribavirin if:  \nBilirubin – Indirect \n \n\n> 5 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n(children and adolescents treated with interferon alfa-2b), \n\nor \n> 4 mg/dL (for > 4 weeks) \n\n(children and adolescents treated with peginterferon alfa-2b) \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly ( 65 years of age) \nThere does not appear to be a significant age-related effect on the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin. \nHowever, as in younger patients, renal function must be determined prior to administration of ribavirin \n(see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients (children 3 years of age and older and adolescents) \nRibavirin may be used in combination with interferon alfa-2b (see section 4.4). The selection of \nribavirin formulation is based on individual characteristics of the patient.  \nThe safety and efficacy of ribavirin used together with direct-acting-anti-virals in these patients has \nnot been established. No data are available. \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for \nfurther dosage recommendations on co-administration. \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent creatinine clearance in these patients (see section 5.2). Therefore, it is recommended that \nrenal function be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of ribavirin. Adult patients with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/minute) should be administered alternating daily \ndoses of 200 mg and 400 mg. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of \n< 30 mL/minute) and patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or on haemodialysis should be \nadministered ribavirin 200 mg/day. Table 4 provides guidelines for dose modification for patients \nwith renal dysfunction. Patients with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with \nrespect to the development of anaemia. No data are available regarding dose modification for \npaediatric patients with renal impairment. \nTable 4 Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment in Adult Patients \nCreatinine Clearance Ribavirin Dose (daily) \n30 to 50 mL/min Alternating doses, 200 mg and 400 mg every other day \nLess than 30 mL/min 200 mg daily \nHaemodialysis (ESRD) 200 mg daily \n \nHepatic impairment  \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction appears between ribavirin and hepatic function (see section 5.2).  \nFor use in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see the corresponding SmPC of the medicinal \nproducts used in combination with ribavirin. \n \nMethod of administration \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. tablets should be administered orally with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n- Pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). In females of childbearing potential, Ribavirin Teva \n\nPharma B.V. must not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained \nimmediately prior to initiation of therapy.  \n\n- Breast-feeding \n- History of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac \n\ndisease, in the previous six months (see section 4.4).  \n- Haemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia, sickle-cell anaemia).  \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with Ribavirin \nTeva Pharma B.V. for contraindications specific to these products. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRibavirin must be used in combination with other medicinal products (see section 5.1). \nPlease refer to the SmPC of (peg)interferon alfa for details on the recommendations of monitoring and \nmanagement regarding the adverse reactions listed below before initiating therapy and other \nprecautions associated with (peg)interferon alfa. \n \nThere are several serious adverse reactions associated with the combination therapy of ribavirin with \n(peg)interferon alfa. These include: \n- Severe psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal ideation, \n\nattempted suicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.) \n- Growth inhibition in children and adolescents that may be irreversible in some patients \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- Increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in children and adolescents \n- Severe ocular disorders \n- Dental and periodontal disorders. \n \nPaediatric population \nWhen deciding not to defer combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b \nuntil adulthood, it is important to consider that this combination therapy induced a growth inhibition \nthat may be irreversible in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case. \n \nHaemolysis \nA decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/dL was observed in up to 14 % of adult patients and 7 % \nof children and adolescents treated with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b in clinical trials. Although ribavirin has no direct cardiovascular effects, anaemia \nassociated with ribavirin may result in deterioration of cardiac function, or exacerbation of the \nsymptoms of coronary disease, or both. Thus, ribavirin must be administered with caution to patients \nwith pre-existing cardiac disease (see section 4.3). Cardiac status must be assessed before start of \ntherapy and monitored clinically during therapy; if any deterioration occurs, therapy must be stopped \n(see section 4.2).  \n \nCardiovascular \nAdult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or \ncurrent arrhythmic disorders must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who \nhave pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course \nof treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy \nbut may require discontinuation of therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history \nof cardiac disease.  \n \nTeratogenic risk \nPrior to initiation of treatment with ribavirin the physician must comprehensively inform both male \nand female patients of the teratogenic risk of ribavirin, the necessity of effective and continuous \ncontraception, the possibility that contraceptive methods may fail and the possible consequences of \npregnancy should it occur during or following treatment with ribavirin (see section 4.6). For \nlaboratory monitoring of pregnancy, please refer to Laboratory tests. \n \nAcute hypersensitivity \nIf an acute hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) \ndevelops, Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical \ntherapy instituted. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.  \n \nLiver function \nAny patient developing significant liver function abnormalities during treatment must be monitored \nclosely. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products used in combination with \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. for discontinuation or dose modification recommendations. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of ribavirin is altered in patients with renal dysfunction due to reduction of \napparent clearance in these patients. Therefore, it is recommended that renal function be evaluated in \nall patients prior to initiation of ribavirin. Due to substantial increases in ribavirin plasma \nconcentrations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, ribavirin dose adjustments are \nrecommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute. No data are available \nregarding dose modification for paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nHaemoglobin concentrations should be monitored closely during treatment and corrective action taken \nas necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nPotential to exacerbate immunosuppression \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 \nweeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This \nmyelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and \nconcomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone (see section \n4.5). \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infection  \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis: Caution should be taken in HIV-positive subjects co-\ninfected with HCV who receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (especially \nddI and d4T) and associated interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment. In the HIV-positive population \nreceiving an NRTI regimen, physicians should carefully monitor markers of mitochondrial toxicity \nand lactic acidosis when ribavirin is administered. For additional details see section 4.5.  \n \nHepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis: \nCo-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) may \nbe at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Other baseline factors in co-infected patients \nthat may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine \nand elevated bilirubin serum concentrations.  \nCo-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely \nmonitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment. Please refer to the corresponding SmPC \nof medicinal products used in combination with ribavirin for discontinuation or dose modification \nrecommendations. Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis \ntreatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:  \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and cART may be at \nincreased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients. Although, the majority of them could be managed \nby dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this \npopulation of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8). \nPatients treated with ribavirin and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia; therefore, \nthe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with low CD4 counts: \nIn patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in \nsubjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µL. Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of \npatients with low CD4 counts.  \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken \nconcurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product \nand the potential for overlapping toxicities with ribavirin.  \n \nLaboratory tests  \nStandard haematologic tests, blood chemistries (complete blood count [CBC] and differential, platelet \ncount, electrolytes, serum creatinine, liver function tests, uric acid) and pregnancy tests must be \nconducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Acceptable baseline values that may be considered \nas a guideline prior to initiation of ribavirin therapy:  \n \nHaemoglobin Adult: ≥ 12 g/dL (females); ≥ 13 g/dL (males)  \n\nChildren and adolescents: ≥ 11 g/dL (females); ≥ 12 g/dL   (males) \n \nLaboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as \nclinically appropriate. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nUric acid may increase with ribavirin due to haemolysis; therefore, the potential for development of \ngout must be carefully monitored in pre-disposed patients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nResults of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated no \ncytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of ribavirin. Ribavirin does not inhibit cytochrome \nP450 enzymes. There is no evidence from toxicity studies that ribavirin induces liver enzymes. \nTherefore, there is a minimal potential for P450 enzyme-based interactions.  \n \nRibavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere \nwith azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine \nmonophosphate (6-MTIMP), which has been associated with myelotoxicity in patients treated with \nazathioprine. The use of pegylated alpha interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine \nshould be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with \nazathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done \nduring concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with \nthese medicines should be stopped (see section 4.4). \n \nNo interaction studies have been conducted with ribavirin and other medicinal products, except for \npeginterferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b and antacids.  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon \nalfa-2b in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.  \n \nAntacid \nThe bioavailability of ribavirin 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing \nmagnesium aluminium and simethicone; AUCtf decreased 14 %. It is possible that the decreased \nbioavailability in this study was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. This interaction is \nnot considered to be clinically relevant.  \n \nNucleoside analogues \nUse of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic \nacidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in \nvitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs \n(e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended. \nReports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, \nhave been reported (see section 4.4).  \nThe exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen \nused to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section \n4.4).Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment \n(ART) regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with  a \nknown history of zidovudine induced anaemia. \n \nAny potential for interactions may persist for up to two months (five half-lives for ribavirin) after \ncessation of ribavirin therapy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).  \n \nThere is no evidence that ribavirin interacts with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or \nprotease inhibitors.  \n \nConflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and ribavirin. \nSome data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at \n\n\n\n33 \n\nrisk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Caution should be exercised \nwhen both medicines are co-administered. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n \nFemale patients \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. must not be used by females who are pregnant (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n5.3). Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients (see section 5.3). Ribavirin \ntherapy must not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately \nprior to initiation of therapy. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive \nduring treatment and for four months after treatment has been concluded; routine monthly pregnancy \ntests must be performed during this time (see section 4.4). If pregnancy does occur during treatment or \nwithin four months from stopping treatment, the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic \nrisk of ribavirin to the foetus (see section 4.4).  \n \nMale patients and their female partners \nExtreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in partners of male patients taking Ribavirin Teva \nPharma B.V. (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). Ribavirin accumulates intracellularly and is cleared from \nthe body very slowly. It is unknown whether the ribavirin that is contained in sperm will exert its \npotential teratogenic or genotoxic effects on the human embryo/foetus. Although data on \napproximately 300 prospectively followed pregnancies with paternal exposure to ribavirin have not \nshown an increased risk of malformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern \nof malformation, either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to \nuse an effective contraceptive during treatment with ribavirin and for seven months after treatment. \nRoutine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time. Men whose partners are \npregnant must be instructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of ribavirin to the partner.  \n \nPregnancy \nThe use of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is contraindicated during pregnancy. Ribavirin has been \nshown in preclinical studies to be teratogenic and genotoxic (see section 4.4 and 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is not known whether ribavirin is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse \nreactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data:  \n- Fertility: In animal studies, ribavirin produced reversible effects on spermatogenesis (see section \n\n5.3).  \n- Teratogenicity: Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal potential have been demonstrated for \n\nribavirin in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted, occurring at \ndoses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose (see section 5.3).  \n\n- Genotoxicity: Ribavirin induces genotoxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V. has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines; \nhowever, other medicinal products used in combination may have an effect. Thus, patients who \ndevelop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment must be cautioned to avoid driving or \noperating machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe salient safety issue of ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia occurring within the first weeks of therapy. \nThe haemolytic anaemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac \nfunction and/or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disease. An increase in uric acid and indirect \nbilirubin values associated with haemolysis were also observed in some patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in this section are primarily derived from clinical trials and/or as adverse \ndrug reactions from spontaneous reports when ribavirin was used in combination with interferon \nalfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nPlease refer to the corresponding SmPC of medicinal products that are used in combination with \nribavirin for additional undesirable effects reported with these products. \n \nAdults \nThe safety of ribavirin is evaluated from data from four clinical trials in patients with no previous \nexposure to interferon (interferon-naïve patients): two trials studied ribavirin in combination with \ninterferon alfa-2b, two trials studied ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.  \n \nPatients who are treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin after previous relapse from interferon \ntherapy or who are treated for a shorter period are likely to have an improved safety profile than that \ndescribed below.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions for adults \nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 5 are based on experience from clinical trials in adult naïve \npatients treated for 1 year and post-marketing use. A certain number of adverse reactions, generally \nattributed to interferon therapy but that have been reported in the context of hepatitis C therapy (in \ncombination with ribavirin) are also listed for reference in Table 5. Also, refer to peginterferon alfa-2b \nand interferon alfa-2b SPCs for adverse reactions that may be attributable to interferon monotherapy. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 5 Adverse reactions reported during clinical trials or following the marketing use of

There \nwere some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa-2b (WHO grade 3: 39 of 186 [21 %]; and WHO grade 4: 13 of \n186 [7 %]); WHO grade 3 leukopenia was also reported in 7 % of this treatment group.  \n \nAn increase in uric acid and indirect bilirubin values associated with haemolysis was observed in some \npatients treated with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or \ninterferon alfa-2b in clinical trials, but values returned to baseline levels by four weeks after the end of \ntherapy. Among those patients with elevated uric acid levels, very few patients treated with the \ncombination developed clinical gout, none of which required treatment modification or \ndiscontinuation from the clinical trials.  \n \nHCV/HIV co-infected patients \nFor HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other \nadverse reactions (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the \nstudies with a frequency > 5 % were: oral candidiasis (14 %), lipodystrophy acquired (13 %), CD4 \nlymphocytes decreased (8 %), appetite decreased (8 %), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9 %), \nback pain (5 %), blood amylase increased (6 %), blood lactic acid increased (5 %), cytolytic hepatitis \n(6 %), lipase increased (6 %) and pain in limb (6 %).   \n \nMitochondrial toxicity \nMitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI \nregimen and associated-ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).  \n \nLaboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients \nAlthough haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more \nfrequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and \nrarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). Haematological abnormalities \nwere more frequently reported in patients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-\n2b when compared to patients receiving ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b. In Study 1 \n(see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in \n4 % (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4 % (8/194) of \npatients receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. Anaemia a (haemoglobin < 9.4 \ng/dL) was reported in 12 % (23/194) of patients treated with ribavirin in combination with \npeginterferon alfa-2b. \n \nCD4 lymphocytes decrease \nTreatment with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b was associated with decreases in \nabsolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage. The \ndecrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy. The use of \n\n\n\n38 \n\nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b had no observable negative impact on the control \nof HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up. Limited safety data (N = 25) are available in co-infected \npatients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µL (see section 4.4).  \nPlease refer to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of \ntoxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with Ribavirin Teva \nPharma B.V in combination with other medicinal products.  \n \nPaediatric population: \nIn combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nIn a clinical trial with 107 children and adolescent patients (3 to 17 years of age) treated with \ncombination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, dose modifications were required in 25 % \nof patients, most commonly for anaemia, neutropenia and weight loss. In general, the adverse \nreactions profile in children and adolescents was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a \npaediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition. During combination therapy for up to \n48 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted \nin reduced height in some patients (see section 4.4). Weight loss and growth inhibition were very \ncommon during the treatment (at the end of treatment, mean decrease from baseline in weight and in \nheight percentiles were of 15 percentiles and 8 percentiles, respectively) and growth velocity was \ninhibited (< 3rd percentile in 70 % of the patients). \n \nAt the end of 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up, mean decrease from baseline in weight and height \npercentiles were still 3 percentiles and 7 percentiles, respectively, and 20% of the children continued \nto have inhibited growth (growth velocity < 3rd percentile). Ninety four of 107 children enrolled in the \n5 year long-term follow up trial. The effects on growth were less in those children treated for 24 weeks \nthan those treated for 48 weeks. From pre-treatment to end of long-term follow up among children \ntreated for 24 or 48 weeks, height for age percentiles decreased 1.3 and 9.0 percentiles, respectively. \nTwenty four percent of children (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of children (19/48) treated for \n48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height for age decrease from pre-treatment to the end of 5 year long \nterm follow up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of children (5/46) \ntreated for 24 weeks and 13 % of children (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed to have a \ndecrease from pre-treatment baseline > 30 height for age percentiles to the end of the 5 year long term \nfollow-up. For weight, pre-treatment to end of long term follow up, weight for age percentiles \ndecreased 1.3 and 5.5 percentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. For \nBMI, pre-treatment to end of long-term follow up, BMI for age percentiles decreased 1.8 and 7.5 \npercentiles among children treated for 24 weeks or 48 weeks, respectively. Decrease in mean height \npercentile at year 1 of long term follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children. The \ndecline of height, weight and BMI Z scores observed during the treatment phase in comparison to a \nnormative population did not fully recover at the end of long-term follow-up period for children \ntreated with 48 weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the treatment phase of this study, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia \n(80 %), headache (62 %), neutropenia (33 %), fatigue (30 %), anorexia (29 %) and injection-site \nerythema (29 %). Only 1 subject discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction \n(thrombocytopenia). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the study were mild or moderate in \nseverity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % (8/107) of all subjects and included injection \nsite pain (1 %), pain in extremity (1 %), headache (1 %), neutropenia (1 %), and pyrexia (4 %). \nImportant treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in this patient population were \nnervousness (8 %), aggression (3 %), anger (2 %), depression/depressed mood (4 %) and \nhypothyroidism (3 %) and 5 subjects received levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism/elevated \nTSH.  \n  \nIn combination with interferon alfa-2b \nIn clinical trials of 118 children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age, treated with combination therapy \nof interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse events. In general, the \n\n\n\n39 \n\nadverse event profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that \nobserved in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as \ndecrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9 percentile) and weight \npercentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the \n5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44th percentile, which was \nbelow the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height \n(48th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a > 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of \nwhom 10 of the 20 children had a > 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of \ntreatment to the end of long-term follow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of \nthose children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits > 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 \nyears after the end of treatment. During combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with interferon alfa-\n2b and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some \npatients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile from baseline to the end of the long-term \nfollow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4).  \n \nFurthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients \n(2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult \npatients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, \nemotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, \nanorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents \ncompared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for \nanaemia and neutropenia.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in paediatric population \nReported adverse reactions listed in Table 6 are based on experience from the two multicentre \nchildren and adolescents clinical trials using ribavirin with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b. \nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 6 Adverse reactions very commonly, commonly and uncommonly reported during clinical \n\ntrials in children and adolescents with ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b or \npeginterferon alfa-2b \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reactions \nInfections and infestations \nVery common: Viral infection, pharyngitis \nCommon: Fungal infection, bacterial infection, pulmonary infection, \n\nnasopharyngitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, \nsinusitis, tooth abscess, influenza, oral herpes, herpes \nsimplex, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, gastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Pneumonia, ascariasis, enterobiasis, herpes zoster, cellulitis \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \nCommon: Neoplasm unspecified \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Anaemia, neutropenia \nCommon: Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy \nEndocrine disorders \nVery common: Hypothyroidism \nCommon: Hyperthyroidism, virilism \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia, increased appetite, decreased appetite \nCommon: Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: Depression, insomnia, emotional liability \n\n\n\n40 \n\nCommon: Suicidal ideation, aggression, confusion, affect liability, \nbehaviour disorder, agitation, somnambulism, anxiety, mood \naltered, restlessness, nervousness, sleep disorder, abnormal \ndreaming, apathy \n\nUncommon:  Abnormal behaviour, depressed mood, emotional disorder, \nfear, nightmare \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache, dizziness \nCommon: Hyperkinesia, tremor, dysphonia, paresthaesia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, concentration impaired, \nsomnolence, disturbance in attention, poor quality of sleep \n\nUncommon: Neuralgia, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity \nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis, eye pain, abnormal vision, lacrimal gland \n\ndisorder \nUncommon: Conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pruritus, keratitis, vision \n\nblurred, photophobia \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon: Vertigo \nCardiac disorders \nCommon: Tachycardia, palpitations \nVascular disorders \nCommon: Pallor, flushing \nUncommon: Hypotension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea, tachypnea, epistaxis, coughing, nasal congestion, \n\nnasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, pharyngolaryngeal \npain. \n\nUncommon: Wheezing, nasal discomfort \nGastro-intestinal disorders \nVery common: Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, vomiting , \n\ndiarrhoea, nausea \nCommon: Mouth ulceration, stomatitis ulcerative, stomatitis, aphthous \n\nstomatitis, dyspepsia, cheilosis, glossitis, gastroesophageal \nreflux, rectal disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, \nconstipation, loose stools, toothache, tooth disorder, \nstomach discomfort, oral pain \n\nUncommon: Gingivitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Hepatic function abnormal \nUncommon: Hepatomegaly \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common: Alopecia, rash \nCommon: Pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, maculopapular rash, \n\nhyperhidrosis, eczema, acne, skin disorder, nail disorder, \nskin discolouration, dry skin, erythema, bruise \n\nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder, dermatitis atopic, skin exfoliation \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: Arthralgia, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain \nCommon: Pain in extremity, back pain, muscle contracture \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Enuresis, micturition disorder, urinary incontinence, \n\nproteinuria \nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n\n\n41 \n\nCommon: Female: amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, \nvaginal disorder, Male: testicular pain \n\nUncommon: Female: dysmenorrhoea \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue, rigors, pyrexia, influenza-like illness, asthenia, \n\nmalaise, irritability \nCommon: Chest pain, oedema, pain, feeling cold \nUncommon: Chest discomfort, facial pain \nInvestigations \nVery common: Growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for \n\nage) \nCommon: Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, thyroglobulin \n\nincreased \nUncommon: Anti-thyroid antibody positive \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nCommon: Skin laceration \nUncommon: Contusion \n \nMost of the changes in laboratory values in the ribavirin/peginterferon alfa-2b clinical trial were mild \nor moderate.

The patient was observed for two days in the emergency room, during which time \nno adverse reaction from the overdose was noted.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, nucleosides and nucleotides excl.reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AB04.  \n \nMechanism of action \nRibavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue which has shown in vitro activity against some RNA and \nDNA viruses. The mechanism by which ribavirin in combination with other medicinal products exerts \nits effects against HCV is unknown. Oral formulations of ribavirin monotherapy have been \ninvestigated as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in several clinical trials. Results of these investigations \nshowed that ribavirin monotherapy had no effect on eliminating hepatitis virus (HCV-RNA) or \nimproving hepatic histology after 6 to 12 months of therapy and 6 months of follow-up.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc�\n\n\n42 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe use of ribavirin in combination treatment with interferon alfa-2b was evaluated in a number of \nclinical trials. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-\nRNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (> 30 IU/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a \nhistological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal \nserum ALT.  \n \nNaïve patients  \nThree trials examined the use of interferon in naïve patients, two with ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b \n(C95-132 and I95-143) and one with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b (C/I98-580). In all cases the \ntreatment was for one year with a follow-up of six months. The sustained response at the end of \nfollow-up was significantly increased by the addition of ribavirin to interferon alfa-2b (41 % vs 16 %, \np < 0.001).  \n \nIn clinical trials C95-132 and I95-143, ribavirin + interferon alfa-2b combination therapy proved to be \nsignificantly more effective than interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (a doubling in sustained response). \nCombination therapy also decreased the relapse rate. This was true for all HCV genotypes.  \n \nIn clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following \ncombination regimens:  \n Ribavirin (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n = 511).  \n Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one \n\nmonth followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n = 514). \n Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n = 505).  \n \nIn this trial, the combination of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) was \nsignificantly more effective than the combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b, particularly in \npatients infected with Genotype 1. Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months \nafter the cessation of treatment.  \n \nHCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. \nHowever, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin \nadministered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b. In those patients that \nreceived > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral \nload, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg \nribavirin (Table 7), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even \nhigher.  \n \nTable 7  Sustained response rates with ribavirin + peginterferon alfa-2b  \n  (by ribavirin dose [mg/kg], genotype and viral load)  \nHCV Genotype  Ribavirin dose \n\n(mg/kg) \nP 1.5/R P 0.5/R I/R \n\nAll Genotypes  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n54 % \n50 % \n61 % \n\n47 % \n41 % \n48 % \n\n47 % \n27 % \n47 % \n\nGenotype 1  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n42 % \n38 % \n48 % \n\n34 % \n25 % \n34 % \n\n33 % \n20 % \n34 % \n\nGenotype 1  ≤ 600,000 \nIU/mL  \n\nAll \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n73 % \n74 % \n71 % \n\n51 % \n25 % \n52 % \n\n45 % \n33 % \n45 % \n\n Genotype 1 > 600,000 \nIU/mL  \n\nAll \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n30 % \n27 % \n37 % \n\n27 % \n25 % \n27 % \n\n29 % \n17 % \n29 % \n\n\n\n43 \n\nGenotype 2/3  All \n≤ 10.6 \n> 10.6 \n\n82 % \n79 % \n88 % \n\n80 % \n73 % \n80 % \n\n79 % \n50 % \n80 % \n\nP1.5/R   Ribavirin (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg)  \nP0.5/R   Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg)  \nI/R   Ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) \n \nHCV/HIV Co-infected patients  \nTwo trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. The response to treatment \nin both of these trials is presented in Table 8. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, \nmulticentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who \nwere co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either ribavirin (800 mg/day) plus \npeginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) or ribavirin (800 mg/day) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) \nfor 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre \nstudy that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-\ninfected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on \nweight) plus peginterferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 µg/week based on weight) or ribavirin (800 -\n1,200 mg/day based on weight) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW). The duration of therapy was 48 \nweeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral \nload < 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6 month follow-up period. \n \nTable 8 Sustained virological response based on genotype after ribavirin in combination \n\nwith peginterferon alfa-2b in HCV/HIV co-infected patients  \n \n\n Study 11  Study 22   \n \n\nRibavirin \n(800 mg/day) \n+ \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b (1.5 \nµg /kg/ week) \n\nRibavirin \n(800 mg/day) + \ninterferon alfa-\n2b (3 MIU \nTIW) p \n\nvaluea  \n\nRibavirin \n(800-\n1,200 mg/day) \nd + \npeginterferon \nalfa-2b (100 \nor 150c \nµg/week) \n\nRibavirin \n(800-\n1,200 mg/day) \nd + interferon \nalfa-2b \n(3 MIU TIW) \n\np \nvalueb  \n\nAll  27 % (56/205) 20 % (41/205) 0.047 44 % (23/52) 21 % (9/43) 0.017 \nGenotype  \n1, 4  \n\n17 % (21/125) 6 % (8/129) 0.006 38 % (12/32) 7 % (2/27) 0.007 \n\nGenotype  \n2, 3  \n\n44 % (35/80) 43 % (33/76) 0.88 53 % (10/19) 47 % (7/15) 0.730 \n\nMIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week.  \na: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test.  \nb: p value based on chi-square test.  \nc: subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week peginterferon alfa-2b and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week peginterferon \nalfa-2b .  \nd: Ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.  \n1\nCarrat F, Bani-Sadr F, Pol S et al.

AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36.  \n\n \nHistological response \nLiver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the \n412 subjects (51 %). Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with \nribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b. This decline was significant among responders (-\n0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among \nnon-responders. In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and \nnone showed worsening. There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study. \nSteatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nRetreatment of relapse patients with Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment \nTwo trials examined the use of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse \npatients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous \ninterferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up. Combination therapy \nwith ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b resulted in a sustained virological response that was ten-fold \nhigher than that with interferon alfa-2b alone (49 % vs 5 %, p < 0.0001). This benefit was maintained \nirrespective of standard predictors of response to interferon alfa-2b such as virus level, HCV genotype \nand histological staging.  \n \nLong-term efficacy data - Adults \nTwo large long-term follow-up studies enrolled 1,071 patients and 567 patients after treatment in prior \nstudies with nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) and pegylated interferon alfa-\n2b (with or without ribavirin), respectively. The purpose of the studies was to evaluate the durability \nof sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical \noutcomes. At least 5 years of long-term follow-up was completed after treatment in 462 patients and \n327 patients, respectively. Twelve out of 492 sustained responders and only 3 out of 366 sustained \nresponders relapsed, respectively, in the studies. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 97 % (95 % CI: 95-99 %) \nfor patients receiving nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin), and is 99 % (95 % \nCI: 98-100 %) for patients receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin). \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated, with or \nwithout ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic \ninfection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of \nhepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable \nHCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in \ntwo multicentre trials and received ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 \ntimes a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment. A total of 118 patients were \nenrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1, 64 % ≤ 12 years of age. The population \nenrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials \nsustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to \nthe lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and \nthe potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of ribavirin and interferon \nalfa-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).  \nThe study results are summarized in Table 9.  \n \nTable 9.

Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during \nfollow-up period \n \nLong-term efficacy data \nRibavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 94 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in a multicentre trial. Of these, sixty-three were sustained responders. The \npurpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and \nassess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment with 24 or 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin \ntreatment. At the end of 5 years, 85 % (80/94) of all enrolled subjects and 86 % (54/63) of sustained \nresponders completed the study. No paediatric subjects with SVR relapsed during the 5 years of \nfollow-up.  \n \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nA five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C \npatients after treatment in two previously mentioned multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all \nenrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose \nof the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess \nthe impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained \nresponders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but \none of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term follow-up \nafter completion of treatment with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for \ncontinued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients \ntreated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at \nfollow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. \n \nSVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in \nlong-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' from \nchronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with \ncirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nRibavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose (mean Tmax=1.5 hours), \nfollowed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases (single dose half-lives of absorption, \ndistribution and elimination are 0.05, 3.73 and 79 hours, respectively). Absorption is extensive with \napproximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces. However, absolute bioavailability \nis approximately 45 %-65 %, which appears to be due to first pass metabolism. There is a linear \nrelationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200-1,200 mg ribavirin. Volume of \ndistribution is approximately 5,000 l. Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins.  \n \nDistribution \nRibavirin transport in non-plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells, and \nhas been identified to be primarily via an es-type equilibrative nucleoside transporter. This type of \ntransporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of \nribavirin. The ratio of whole blood:plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1; the excess \nof ribavirin in whole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes.  \n \nBiotransformation \nRibavirin has two pathways of metabolism: 1) a reversible phosphorylation pathway; 2) a degradative \npathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxyacid metabolite. \nBoth ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are also excreted \nrenally.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nRibavirin has been shown to produce high inter and intra subject pharmacokinetic variability \nfollowing single oral doses (intrasubject variability of approximately 30 % for both AUC and Cmax), \nwhich may be due to extensive first pass metabolism and transfer within and beyond the blood \ncompartment. \n \nElimination \nUpon multiple dosing, ribavirin accumulates extensively in plasma with a six-fold ratio of \nmultiple-dose to single-dose AUC12hr. Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID, steady-state was \nreached by approximately four weeks, with mean steady state plasma concentrations approximately \n2,200 ng/mL. Upon discontinuation of dosing the half-life was approximately 298 hours, which \nprobably reflects slow elimination from non-plasma compartments.  \n \nTransfer into seminal fluid \nSeminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal fluid is \napproximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female \npartner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely \nlimited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. \n \nFood effect \nThe bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by co-administration of a high fat \nmeal (AUCtf and Cmax both increased by 70 %). It is possible that the increased bioavailability in this \nstudy was due to delayed transit of ribavirin or modified pH. The clinical relevance of results from this \nsingle dose study is unknown. In the pivotal clinical efficacy trial, patients were instructed to take \nribavirin with food to achieve the maximal plasma concentration of ribavirin.  \n \nRenal function \nBased on published data, single-dose ribavirin pharmacokinetics was altered (increased AUCtf and \nCmax) in patients with renal dysfunction compared with control subjects (creatinine clearance > \n90 mL/minute). The mean AUCtf was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance between \n10 and 30 mL/min compared with control subjects. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 30 \nand 50 mL/min, AUCtf was twofold greater compared with control subjects. This appears to be due to \nreduction of apparent clearance in these patients. Ribavirin concentrations are essentially unchanged \nby haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic function \nSingle-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \ndysfunction (Child-Pugh Classification A, B or C) is similar to those of normal controls.  \n \nOlder people (≥ 65 years of age) \nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not been performed. However, in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic study, age was not a key factor in the kinetics of ribavirin; renal function \nis the determining factor.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using sparsely sampled serum concentration \nvalues from four controlled clinical trials. The clearance model developed showed that body weight, \ngender, age, and serum creatinine were the main covariates. For males, clearance was approximately \n20 % higher than for females. Clearance increased as a function of body weight and was reduced at \nages greater than 40 years. Effects of these covariates on ribavirin clearance appear to be of limited \nclinical significance due to the substantial residual variability not accounted for by the model.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nRibavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b in children and \nadolescents with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 10. The \n\n\n\n47 \n\npharmacokinetics of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b (dose-normalized) is similar in adults and children \nor adolescents.  \n \nTable 10.

Malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, \nlimbs, skeleton and gastrointestinal tract were noted. The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects \nincreased with escalation of the dose. Survival of foetuses and offspring was reduced.  \n \nIn a juvenile rat toxicity study, pups dosed from postnatal day 7 to 63 with 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg of \nribavirin demonstrated a dose-related decrease in overall growth, which was subsequently manifested \nas slight decreases in body weight, crown-rump length and bone length. At the end of the recovery \nperiod, tibial and femoral changes were minimal although generally statistically significant compared \nto controls in males at all dose levels and in females dosed with the two highest doses compared to \ncontrols. No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed \nregarding neurobehavioural or reproductive development. Plasma concentrations achieved in rat pups \nwere below human plasma concentrations at the therapeutic dose.  \n \nErythrocytes are a primary target of toxicity for ribavirin in animal studies. Anaemia occurs shortly \nafter initiation of dosing, but is rapidly reversible upon cessation of treatment.  \nIn 3- and 6-month studies in mice to investigate ribavirin-induced testicular and sperm effects, \nabnormalities in sperm, occurred at doses of 15 mg/kg and above. These doses in animals produce \nsystemic exposures well below those achieved in humans at therapeutic doses. Upon cessation of \ntreatment, essentially total recovery from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity occurred within one or \ntwo spermatogenic cycles (see section 4.6).  \n \nGenotoxicity studies have demonstrated that ribavirin does exert some genotoxic activity. Ribavirin \nwas active in the Balb/3T3 in vitro transformation assay. Genotoxic activity was observed in the \nmouse lymphoma assay, and at doses of 20-200 mg/kg in a mouse micronucleus assay. A dominant \nlethal assay in rats was negative, indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted \nthrough male gametes.  \n \nConventional carcinogenicity rodent studies with low exposures compared to human exposure under \ntherapeutic conditions (factor 0.1 in rats and 1 in mice) did not reveal tumorigenicity of ribavirin. In \naddition, in a 26 week carcinogenicity study using the heterozygous p53(+/-) mouse model, ribavirin \ndid not produce tumours at the maximally tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg (plasma exposure factor \napproximately 2.5 compared to human exposure). These studies suggest that a carcinogenic potential \nof ribavirin in humans is unlikely.  \n \nRibavirin plus interferon \n\n\n\n48 \n\nWhen used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, ribavirin did not cause any \neffects not previously seen with either active substance alone. The major treatment-related change was \na reversible mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either \nactive substance alone. \n \n \n6.

For paediatric patients (children \nand adolescents) weighing less than 47 kg a solution formulation is available. \n \nPreviously treated adult patients: \nThe combination of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. with interferon alfa-2b is used to treat adult patients \nwith chronic hepatitis C, who have previously responded to treatment with an alpha interferon alone, \nbut whose condition has recurred. \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with pegylated or other forms of \ninterferon (i.e., not alfa-2b). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2.

These include: \n Psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal thoughts, attempted \n\nsuicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.). Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you \nare becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want \nto consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression \nor changes in your behaviour \n\n Severe eye disorders \n Dental and periodontal disorders: Dental and gum disorders have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving ribavirin in combination with (peg)interferon alfa-2b. You should brush your teeth \nthoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may \nexperience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards \n\n Inability to achieve full adult height may occur in some children and adolescents \n Increased hormone related to your thyroid (TSH) in children and adolescents \n \nPaediatric population \nIf you are caring for a child and your doctor decides not to defer combination treatment with \npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b until adulthood, it is important to understand that this \ncombination therapy induces a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients.  \n \nIn addition these events have occurred in patients taking Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V.: \nHaemolysis: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. can cause a break down in red blood cells causing anaemia \nwhich may impair your heart function or worsen symptoms of heart disease. \nPancytopenia: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. can cause a decrease in your platelet and red and white \nblood cell count when used in combination with peginterferon.  \n \nStandard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function. \n- Blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working. \n- Depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of tablets \n\nyou or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of this medicine, and/or \nchange the length of time to take this treatment. \n\n- If you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped. \n \nSeek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as \ndifficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you or your child you are caring for: \n are a woman of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). \n are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n had a previous heart condition or have heart disease. \n have another liver problem in addition to hepatitis C infection. \n have problems with your kidneys. \n have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or have ever had any other problems with your \n\nimmune system. \n \nPlease refer to the Package Leaflet of (peg)interferon alfa for more detailed information on these \nsafety issues. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nReminder: Please read the “Warnings and precautions” section of the Package Leaflet for the other \n\nmedicines used in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. before you begin \ncombination treatment. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nIf the child is weighing less than 47 kg or unable to swallow tablets an oral solution of ribavirin should \nbe used. \n \nOther medicines and Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for, are taking, have recently taken or \nmight take: \n- azathioprine is a medicine that suppresses your immune system, using this medicine in \n\ncombination with ribavirin may increase your risk of developing severe blood disorders. \n- anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) medicines – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI), and/or combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART)]: \n- Taking this medicine in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-HIV medicine \n\nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities \ndevelopment (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white \nblood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets). \n\n- With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if this medicine will change the way these \nmedicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV \ninfection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not \nyour Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients \nreceiving zidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at \nincreased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).  Therefore the use \nof zidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended. \n\n- Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis, \nthe use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and \nstavudine should be avoided. \n\n- Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cART may be at increased risk \nof worsening liver function. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\n \nReminder: Please read the “Other medicines” section of the Package Leaflet for the other medicines \n\nused in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. before you begin combination \ntreatment with this medicine. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant you must not take this medicine. This medicine can be very damaging to your \nunborn baby (embryo). \n \nBoth female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \npossibility for pregnancy to occur: \n• Girl or woman of childbearing age: \nYou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the \n4 months after treatment is stopped. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n• Men \nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the possibility for \nribavirin to be left in the woman’s body.  \nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy \neach month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You or your female \npartner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking this medicine and for \n7 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor (see “Do not take \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V.”). \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nIf you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take this medicine.

This medicine stops the \nmultiplication of many types of viruses, including hepatitis C virus.

For paediatric patients (children \nand adolescents) weighing less than 47 kg a solution formulation is available. \n \nPreviously treated adult patients: \nThe combination of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. with interferon alfa-2b is used to treat adult patients \nwith chronic hepatitis C, who have previously responded to treatment with an alpha interferon alone, \nbut whose condition has recurred. \n \nThere is no safety or efficacy information on the use of ribavirin with pegylated or other forms of \ninterferon (i.e., not alfa-2b). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2.

These include: \n Psychiatric and central nervous system effects (such as depression, suicidal thoughts, attempted \n\nsuicide and aggressive behaviour, etc.). Be sure to seek emergency care if you notice that you \nare becoming depressed or have suicidal thoughts or change in your behaviour. You may want \nto consider asking a family member or close friend to help you stay alert to signs of depression \nor changes in your behaviour \n\n Severe eye disorders \n Dental and periodontal disorders: Dental and gum disorders have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving ribavirin in combination with (peg)interferon alfa-2b. You should brush your teeth \nthoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may \nexperience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly \nafterwards \n\n Inability to achieve full adult height may occur in some children and adolescents \n Increased hormone related to your thyroid (TSH) in children and adolescents \n \nPaediatric population \nIf you are caring for a child and your doctor decides not to defer combination treatment with \npeginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b until adulthood, it is important to understand that this \ncombination therapy induces a growth inhibition that may be irreversible in some patients.  \n \nIn addition these events have occurred in patients taking Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V.: \nHaemolysis: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. can cause a break down in red blood cells causing anaemia \nwhich may impair your heart function or worsen symptoms of heart disease. \nPancytopenia: Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. can cause a decrease in your platelet and red and white \nblood cell count when used in combination with peginterferon.  \n \nStandard blood tests will be taken to check your blood, kidney and liver function. \n- Blood tests will be done regularly to help your doctor to know if this treatment is working. \n- Depending upon the results of these tests, your doctor may change/adjust the number of tablets \n\nyou or the child you are caring for take, prescribe a different pack size of this medicine, and/or \nchange the length of time to take this treatment. \n\n- If you have or develop severe kidney or liver problems, this treatment will be stopped. \n \nSeek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as \ndifficulty in breathing, wheezing or hives) while taking this treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you or your child you are caring for: \n are a woman of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). \n are a male and your female partner is of childbearing age (see section “Pregnancy and breast-\n\nfeeding”). \n had a previous heart condition or have heart disease. \n have another liver problem in addition to hepatitis C infection. \n have problems with your kidneys. \n have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or have ever had any other problems with your \n\nimmune system. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nPlease refer to the Package Leaflet of (peg)interferon alfa for more detailed information on these \nsafety issues. \n \nReminder: Please read the “Warnings and precautions” section of the Package Leaflet for the other \n\nmedicines used in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. before you begin \ncombination treatment. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nIf the child is weighing less than 47 kg or unable to swallow tablets an oral solution of ribavirin should \nbe used. \n \nOther medicines and Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child you are caring for, are taking, have recently taken or \nmight take: \n- azathioprine is a medicine that suppresses your immune system, using this medicine in \n\ncombination with ribavirin may increase your risk of developing severe blood disorders. \n- anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) medicines – [nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitor (NRTI), and/or combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART)]: \n- Taking this medicine in combination with an alpha interferon and an anti-HIV medicine \n\nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and blood abnormalities \ndevelopment (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white \nblood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets). \n\n- With zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if this medicine will change the way these \nmedicines work. Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV \ninfection is not getting worse. If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not \nyour Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. treatment needs to be changed. Additionally, patients \nreceiving zidovudine with ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons could be at \nincreased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).  Therefore the use \nof zidovudine and ribavirin in combination with alpha interferons is not recommended. \n\n- Due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis, \nthe use of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended and the use of ribavirin and \nstavudine should be avoided. \n\n- Co-infected patients with advanced liver disease receiving cART may be at increased risk \nof worsening liver function. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in \ncombination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. \n\n \nReminder: Please read the “Other medicines” section of the Package Leaflet for the other medicines \n\nused in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. before you begin combination \ntreatment with this medicine. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant you must not take this medicine. This medicine can be very damaging to your \nunborn baby (embryo). \n \nBoth female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any \npossibility for pregnancy to occur: \n• Girl or woman of childbearing age: \nYou must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the \n4 months after treatment is stopped. This should be discussed with your doctor. \n• Men  \nDo not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the possibility for \nribavirin to be left in the woman’s body.  \nIf your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy \neach month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. You or your female \npartner must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking this medicine and for \n\n\n\n77 \n\n7 months after stopping treatment. This should be discussed with your doctor (see “Do not take \nRibavirin Teva Pharma B.V.”). \n \nIf you are a woman who is breast-feeding, you must not take this medicine. Discontinue breast-feeding \nbefore starting to take this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine does not effect your ability to drive or use machines;  \nHowever, other medicines used in combination with Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. may cause \nsleepiness, tiredness or confusion. \nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy, or are confused. \n \n \n3.
