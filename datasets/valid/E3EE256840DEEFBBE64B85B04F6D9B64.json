NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPosaconazole Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gastro-resistant tablet contains 100 mg of posaconazole. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGastro-resistant tablet \nYellow coated, capsule shaped tablet of approximate 17.5 mm length and 6.7 mm width, debossed \nwith \u201c100P\u201d on one side and plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPosaconazole Accord is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults \n(see section 5.1): \n- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or \n\nitraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; \n- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B; \n- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole \n\nor in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; \n- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or \n\nfluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products. \n \nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days \nof prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. \n \nPosaconazole Accord is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following \npatients: \n- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) \n\nor myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are \nat high risk of developing invasive fungal infections; \n\n- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose \nimmunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing \ninvasive fungal infections. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNon-Interchangeability between Posaconazole Accord tablets and posaconazole oral suspension \n \nThe tablet and oral suspension are not to be used interchangeably due to the differences between these \ntwo formulations in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration \nachieved. Therefore, follow the specific dosage recommendations for each formulation.  \n \nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in \nthe supportive care in the high risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nPosaconazole is also available as 40 mg/mL oral suspension and 300 mg concentrate for solution for \ninfusion. Posaconazole tablets are the preferred formulation to optimize plasma concentrations and \ngenerally provide higher plasma drug exposures than posaconazole oral suspension. \n \nRecommended dose is shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1. Recommended dose according to indication.  \nIndication    Dose and duration of therapy \n\n(See section 5.2) \nRefractory invasive fungal infections \n(IFI)/patients with IFI intolerant to 1st \nline therapy \n\nLoading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day \non the first day, then 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a \nday thereafter. Each dose may be taken without regard to \nfood intake. Duration of therapy should be based on the \nseverity of the underlying disease, recovery from \nimmunosuppression, and clinical response. \n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal \ninfections \n\nLoading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day \non the first day, then 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a \nday thereafter. Each dose may be taken without regard to \nfood intake. Duration of therapy is based on recovery from \nneutropenia or immunosuppression. For patients with acute \nmyelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, \nprophylaxis with Posaconazole Accord should start several \ndays before the anticipated onset of neutropenia and continue \nfor 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 500 cells per \nmm3. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAn effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose \nadjustment is recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nLimited data on the effect of hepatic impairment (including Child-Pugh C classification of chronic \nliver disease) on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole demonstrate an increase in plasma exposure \ncompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, but do not suggest that dose adjustment is \nnecessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended to exercise caution due to the potential for \nhigher plasma exposure. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of posaconazole in children aged below 18 years have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made. \n \nNo data are available for the tablet formulation. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nPosaconazole Accord may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should be \nswallowed whole with water and should not be crushed, chewed, or broken. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, \nhalofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nThere is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other azole antifungal \nagents. Caution should be used when prescribing Posaconazole Accord to patients with \nhypersensitivity to other azoles. \n \nHepatic toxicity \n \nHepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin \nand/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with posaconazole. Elevated liver \nfunction tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and in some instances these tests \nnormalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic reactions with fatal outcomes \nhave been reported. \nPosaconazole should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to limited clinical \nexperience and the possibility that posaconazole plasma levels may be higher in these patients (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nMonitoring of hepatic function \n \nLiver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. \nPatients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Posaconazole Accord therapy must be \nroutinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should \ninclude laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). \nDiscontinuation of Posaconazole Accord should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms are \nconsistent with development of liver disease. \n \nQTc prolongation \n \nSome azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Posaconazole Accord must \nnot be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 and are known to prolong \nthe QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole Accord should be administered with caution \nto patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as: \n- Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation \n- Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure \n- Sinus bradycardia \n- Existing symptomatic arrhythmias \n- Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those \n\nmentioned in section 4.3). \n \nElectrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should \nbe monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nDrug interactions \n \nPosaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines \n \nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation and possible respiratory depression co-administration of \nposaconazole with any benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, \nalprazolam) should only be considered if clearly necessary. Dose adjustment of benzodiazepines \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nVincristine toxicity \n \nConcomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been \nassociated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral \nneuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve \nazole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options (see section 4.5). \n \nRifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, primidone), and efavirenz \n \nPosaconazole concentrations may be significantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use \nwith posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPlasma exposure \n \nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets are generally \nhigher than those obtained with posaconazole oral suspension. Posaconazole plasma concentrations \nfollowing administration of posaconazole tablets may increase over time in some patients (see \nsection 5.2). Safety data at higher exposure levels achieved with posaconazole tablets are at present \nlimited. \n \nGastrointestinal dysfunction \n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as \nsevere diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for \nbreakthrough fungal infections. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on posaconazole \n \nPosaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p- \nglycoprotein (P-gp) efflux in vitro. Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) \nof these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, \nrespectively. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRifabutin \nRifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area \nunder the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57% and 51%, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be \navoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the effect of \nposaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels. \n \nEfavirenz \nEfavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45% and 50%, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk.  \n \nFosamprenavir \nCombining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma \nconcentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal \ninfections is recommended. Repeat dose administration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily x \n10 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily on the \n1st day, 200 mg twice daily on the 2nd day, then 400 mg twice daily x 8 Days) by 21% and 23%, \nrespectively. The effect of posaconazole on fosamprenavir levels when fosamprenavir is given with \nritonavir is unknown. \n \nPhenytoin \nPhenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41% and 50%, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk. \n \nH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors \nNo clinically relevant effects were observed when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with \nantacids, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. No dosage adjustment of posaconazole \ntablets is required when posaconazole tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H2-receptor \nantagonists and proton pump inhibitors. \n \nEffects of posaconazole on other medicinal products \n \nPosaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the \neffects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co- \nadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of \nthe CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be \nassociated with unacceptable adverse reactions, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate \nand/or adverse reactions should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the \ninteraction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole \noccurs compared to patients administered the same dose. The effect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 \nsubstrates in patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is \nexpected to be variable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The \neffect of co-administration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be \nvariable within a patient. \n \nTerfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates) \nCo-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or \nquinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nErgot alkaloids \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPosaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and \ndihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot \nalkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and \natorvastatin) \nPosaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated with \nrhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).  \n \nVinca alkaloids \nMost of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant \nadministration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with \nserious adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of \nvinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, \nreserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including \nvincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options. \n \nRifabutin \nPosaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31% and 72%, respectively. Concomitant \nuse of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the \nrisk (see also above regarding the effect of rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). If these \nmedicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions \nrelated to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended. \n \nSirolimus \nRepeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-fold and 8.9-fold (range \n3.1 to 17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The effect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients \nis unknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. \nCo-administration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided \nwhenever possible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended \nthat the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy \nand that there should be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole \nblood. Sirolimus concentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at \ndiscontinuation of posaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly. It should be \nnoted that the relationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during \nco-administration with posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the \nusual therapeutic range may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore, trough concentrations that fall \nin the upper part of the usual therapeutic range should be targeted and careful attention should be paid \nto clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies. \n \nCiclosporin \nIn heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg once \ndaily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin \nlevels resulting in serious adverse reactions, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of \nleukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with \nposaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. \nto about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose \nof ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary. \n \nTacrolimus \nPosaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single dose) by 121% \nand 358%, respectively. Clinically significant interactions resulting in hospitalisation and/or \nposaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating posaconazole \n\n\n\n8 \n\ntreatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced (e.g. to \nabout one third of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of tacrolimus should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose of \ntacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary. \n \nHIV Protease inhibitors \nAs HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that posaconazole will increase \nplasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral \nsuspension (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects \nCmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-fold \nrespectively. Following co-administration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily) with \natazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of \natazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The \naddition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated \nwith increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity \nrelated to antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co- \nadministration with posaconazole. \n \nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4 \nIn a study in healthy volunteers posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg once daily for 10 days) \nincreased the exposure (AUC) of intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) by 83%. In another study in \nhealthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg twice daily \nfor 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of intravenous midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average \nof 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole oral suspension 400 mg twice \ndaily for 7 days increased the intravenous midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to \n7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (2 mg \nsingle oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg \nor 400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to \n8-10 hours during co-administration. \nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered \nwhen posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by \nCYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam) (see section 4.4). \n \nCalcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, \nnisoldipine) \nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is \nrecommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel \nblockers may be required. \n \nDigoxin \nAdministration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. Therefore, \nposaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be monitored \nwhen initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment. \n \nSulfonylureas \nGlucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-administered \nwith posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThere is insufficient information on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole \nmust not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk \nto the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPosaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of \nposaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with posaconazole.  \n \nFertility \n \nPosaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at doses up to 180 mg/kg (3.4 times the 300 mg \ntablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg/kg \n(2.6 times the 300 mg tablet based on steady-state plasma concentrations in patients). There is no \nclinical experience assessing the impact of posaconazole on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSince certain adverse reactions (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, etc.) have been reported with \nposaconazole use, which potentially may affect driving/operating machinery, caution needs to be used. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSafety data mainly derive from studies with the oral suspension. \n \nThe tablet formulation was investigated in AML and MDS patients and those after HSCT with or at \nrisk for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) only. Maximum duration of exposure to the tablet \nformulation was shorter than with the oral suspension. Plasma exposure resulting from the tablet \nformulation was higher than observed with the oral suspension. A higher incidence of adverse \nreactions cannot be ruled out. \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nPosaconazole tablets \nThe safety of posaconazole tablets has been assessed in 230 patients enrolled in the pivotal clinical \nstudy. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of posaconazole \ntablets when given as antifungal prophylaxis. Patients were immunocompromised with underlying \nconditions including haematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, GVHD, and post \nHSCT. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days. Twenty patients received \n200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on \nDay 1 in each cohort). \n \nPosaconazole tablet and oral suspension safety \nThe safety of posaconazole oral suspension has been assessed in > 2,400 patients and healthy \nvolunteers enrolled in clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported \nserious related adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased \nbilirubin. \nThe safety of posaconazole tablet has been assessed in 336 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in \nclinical trials. The safety profile of tablets was similar to that of the oral suspension. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n10 \n\nWithin the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the \nfollowing categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known. \n \nTable 2.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose of posaconazole tablets. \n \nDuring clinical trials, patients who received posaconazole oral suspension doses up to 1,600 mg/day \nexperienced no different adverse reactions from those reported with patients at the lower doses. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nAccidental overdose was noted in one patient who took posaconazole oral suspension 1,200 mg twice \na day for 3 days. No adverse reactions were noted by the investigator. \n \nPosaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no special treatment available in the case of \noverdose with posaconazole. Supportive care may be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02AC04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPosaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential \nstep in ergosterol biosynthesis. \n \nMicrobiology \n \nPosaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the following microorganisms: Aspergillus \nspecies (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species \n(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. \ninconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus. The microbiological data \nsuggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus; however the clinical \ndata are currently too limited to assess the efficacy of posaconazole against these causative agents. \n \nResistance \n \nClinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle \nmechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51. \n \nEpidemiological Cut-off (ECOFF) Values for Aspergillus spp. \nThe ECOFF values for posaconazole, which distinguish the wild type population from isolates with \nacquired resistance, have been determined by EUCAST methodology. \n \nEUCAST ECOFF values: \n- Aspergillus flavus: 0.5 mg/L \n- Aspergillus fumigatus: 0.25 mg/L \n- Aspergillus nidulans: 0.5 mg/L \n- Aspergillus niger: 0.5 mg/L \n- Aspergillus terreus: 0.25 mg/L \n \nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for Aspergillus spp. ECOFF values do \nnot equate to clinical breakpoints. \n \nBreakpoints \n \nEUCAST MIC breakpoints for posaconazole [susceptible (S); resistant (R)]: \n- Candida albicans: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L \n- Candida tropicalis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L \n- Candida parapsilosis: S \u22640.06 mg/L, R >0.06 mg/L \n \nThere are currently insufficient data to set clinical breakpoints for other Candida species. \n \nCombination with other antifungal agents \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or \nthe other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will \nprovide an added benefit. \n \nClinical experience \n \nSummary of posaconazole tablet bridging study \n \nStudy 5615 was a non-comparative multi-center study performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic \nproperties, safety, and tolerability of posaconazole tablet. Study 5615 was conducted in a similar \npatient population to that previously studied in the pivotal posaconazole oral suspension clinical \nprogram. The pharmacokinetics and safety data from Study 5615 were bridged to the existing data \n(including efficacy data) with the oral suspension. \n \nThe subject population included: 1) patients with AML or MDS who had recently received \nchemotherapy and had developed or were anticipated to develop significant neutropenia, or 2) patients \nwho had undergone a HSCT and were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prevention or \ntreatment of GVHD. Two different dosing groups were evaluated: 200 mg twice daily on Day 1, \nfollowed by 200 mg once daily thereafter (Part IA) and 300 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by \n300 mg once daily thereafter (Part 1B and Part 2). \n \nSerial PK samples were collected on Day 1 and at steady-state on Day 8 for all Part 1 subjects and a \nsubset of Part 2 subjects. Moreover, sparse PK samples were collected at several days during steady \nstate before the next dose (Cmin) for a larger subject population. Based on average Cmin concentrations, \na predicted average concentration (Cav) could be calculated for 186 subjects dosed with 300 mg. PK \nanalysis in patients of Cav found that 81% of the subjects treated with the 300 mg once daily dose \nattained steady state predicted Cav between 500-2,500 ng/mL. One subject (<1%) had a predicted Cav \nbelow 500 ng/mL and 19% of the subjects had a predicted Cav above 2,500 ng/mL. Subjects achieved \na mean predicted Cav at steady state of 1,970 ng/mL. \n \nIn Table 3 a comparison is shown of exposure (Cav) after administration of posaconazole tablet and \nposaconazole oral suspension at therapeutic doses in patients depicted as quartile analysis. Exposures \nafter tablet administration are generally higher than, but overlapping with, exposures after \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension. \n \nTable 3.

Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an \nexternal control group derived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control \ngroup included 86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the \nsame sites as the patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered \nto be refractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88%) and in the external control \ngroup (79%). \nAs shown in Table 4, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment was \nseen in 42% of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26% of the external group. However, this \nwas not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external control \ngroup should be viewed with caution. \n \nTable 4.

Among \neighteen patients who were intolerant or had infections refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, \nseven patients were classed as responders. \n \nChromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma \n9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had chromoblastomycosis \ndue to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella species. \n \nCoccidioidomycosis \n11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or partial resolution of \nsigns and symptoms present at baseline) with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days. \n \nProphylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) (Studies 316 and 1899) \nTwo randomised, controlled prophylaxis studies were conducted among patients at high risk for \ndeveloping invasive fungal infections. \n \nStudy 316 was a randomised, double-blind trial of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a \nday) versus fluconazole capsules (400 mg once daily) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant \nrecipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of \nproven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomization as determined by an independent, blinded \nexternal expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs during the \non-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The majority \n(377/600, [63%]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive (195/600, [32.5%]) \n\n\n\n15 \n\nGVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole and 77 days for \nfluconazole. \n \nStudy 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three \ntimes a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg \ntwice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute \nmyelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel \nduring the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nat 100 days post-randomization. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukaemia was the most \ncommon underlying condition (435/602, [72%]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for \nposaconazole and 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole. \n \nIn both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection. See Table 5 \nand 6 for results from both studies. There were fewer breakthrough Aspergillus infections in patients \nreceiving posaconazole prophylaxis when compared to control patients. \n \nTable 5.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the \n\n\n\n16 \n\nprobability of survival up to day 100 after randomization, was significantly higher for posaconazole \nrecipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death \n(P=0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209). \n \nIn Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25%; FLU, 28%); however, the proportion of \nIFI- related deaths was significantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU group \n(12/299; P= 0.0413). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no paediatric experience for posaconazole tablets. \n \nSixteen patients 8-17 years of age were treated with posaconazole oral suspension 800 mg/day in a \nstudy for invasive fungal infections. Based on the available data in 16 of these paediatric patients, the \nsafety profile appears to be similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age. \n \nAdditionally, twelve patients 13-17 years of age received posaconazole oral suspension 600 mg/day \nfor prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (Studies 316 and 1899). The safety profile in these \npatients < 18 years of age appears similar to the safety profile observed in adults. Based on \npharmacokinetic data in 10 of these paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic profile appears to be \nsimilar to patients \u2265 18 years of age. \n \nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.  \n \nElectrocardiogram evaluation \nMultiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during \nadministration of posaconazole oral suspension (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from \n173 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the \nmean QTc (Fridericia) interval from baseline were observed. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships \n \nA correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical \noutcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is \nparticularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected \nwith Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens). \n \nAbsorption \n \nPosaconazole tablets are absorbed with a median Tmax of 4 to 5 hours and exhibits dose proportional \npharmacokinetics after single and multiple dosing up to 300 mg. \n \nFollowing a single dose administration of 300 mg posaconazole tablets after a high fat meal to healthy \nvolunteers, the AUC0-72 hours and Cmax were higher compared to administration under fasted condition \n(51% and 16% for AUC0-72 hours and Cmax respectively). \n \nPosaconazole plasma concentrations following administration of posaconazole tablets may increase \nover time in some patients. The reason for this time-dependency is not completely understood. \n \nDistribution \n \nPosaconazole, after administration of the tablet, has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 394 L \n(42%), ranging between 294-583 L among the studies in healthy volunteers. \n \nPosaconazole is highly protein bound (> 98%), predominantly to serum albumin.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nBiotransformation \n \nPosaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to be \naltered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide \nconjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites \nobserved. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17% of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose. \n \nElimination \n \nPosaconazole after administration of the tablets, is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t\u00bd) of \n29 hours (range 26 to 31 hours) and a mean apparent clearance ranging from 7.5 to 11 L/hr. After \nadministration of 14C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77% of \nthe radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66% of the radiolabelled \ndose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14% of the radiolabelled dose excreted in \nurine (< 0.2% of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state plasma concentrations are \nattained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose (once daily after twice daily loading dose at Day 1). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nChildren (< 18 years) \nThere is no paediatric experience with posaconazole tablets. \nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole oral suspension have been evaluated in paediatric patients. \nFollowing administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole oral suspension as a divided dose for \ntreatment of invasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients \n8-17 years of age (776 ng/mL) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18-64 years of age \n(817 ng/mL). No pharmacokinetic data are available from paediatric patients less than 8 years of age. \nSimilarly, in the prophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) \nwas comparable among ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (\u2265 18 years of \nage). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in men and women. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets are comparable in young and elderly subjects. No \noverall differences in safety were observed between the geriatric patients and younger patients; \ntherefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for geriatric patients. \n \nRace \nThere is insufficient data among different races with posaconazole tablets.  \nThere was a slight decrease (16%) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black \nsubjects relative to Caucasian subjects. However, the safety profile of posaconazole between the Black \nand Caucasian subjects was similar. \n \nWeight \nPharmacokinetic modeling with an oral tablet formulation suggests that patients weighing greater than \n120 kg may have lower posaconazole exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for \nbreakthrough fungal infections in patients weighing more than 120 kg. \n \nPatients, in particular those receiving posaconazole after HSCT, who have a low body weight \n(< 60 kg) are more likely to experience higher plasma concentrations of posaconazole and should be \nclosely monitored for adverse events. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n18 \n\nFollowing single-dose administration of posaconazole oral suspension, there was no effect of mild and \nmoderate renal impairment (n=18, Cl cr \u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is required. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, \nClcr< 20 mL/min/1.73 m2), the AUC of posaconazole was highly variable [> 96% CV (coefficient of \nvariance)] compared to other renal groups [< 40% CV]. However, as posaconazole is not significantly \nrenally eliminated, an effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is \nnot expected and no dose adjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been \nconducted with the posaconazole tablets. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter a single oral dose of 400 mg posaconazole oral suspension to patients with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (six per \ngroup), the mean AUC was 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher compared to that for matched control subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Unbound concentrations were not determined and it cannot be excluded that \nthere is a larger increase in unbound posaconazole exposure than the observed 60% increase in total \nAUC. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was prolonged from approximately 27 hours up to ~43 hours in \nrespective groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to severe hepatic \nimpairment but caution is advised due to the potential for higher plasma exposure. \n \nSimilar recommendations apply to posaconazole tablets; however, a specific study has not been \nconducted with the posaconazole tablets. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAs observed with other azole antifungal agents, effects related to inhibition of steroid hormone \nsynthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects \nwere observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained \nat therapeutic doses in humans. \n \nNeuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for \u2265 3 months at lower systemic exposures than \nthose obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one \nyear. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed \non the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved \ntherapeutically. \n \nPulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the \n2-year study in rats. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for functional changes \nin humans. \n \nNo effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety \npharmacology study in monkeys at maximal plasma concentrations 8.5-fold greater than the \nconcentrations obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of \ncardiac decompensation in a repeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure \n2.1-fold greater than that achieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up \nto 29 mm-Hg) were seen in rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 2.1-fold and 8.5-fold greater, \nrespectively, than those achieved with the human therapeutic doses. \n \nReproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower \nthan those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and \nmalformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability. \nIn rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic \ndoses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered \nto be due to a treatment-related effect on steroidogenesis. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nPosaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal \nspecial hazards for humans. \n \n \n6.
