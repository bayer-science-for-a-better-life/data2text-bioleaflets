NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFoclivia suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)* of strain: \n \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms** \nper 0.5 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens\u2019 eggs from healthy chicken flocks \n** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin. \n \nAdjuvant MF59C.1 containing: \nSqualene 9.75 milligrams \nPolysorbate 80 1.175 milligrams \nSorbitan trioleate 1.175 milligrams \nSodium citrate 0.66 milligrams \nCitric acid 0.04 milligrams \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nThe vaccine contains 1.899 milligrams of sodium and 0.081 milligrams of potassium per 0.5 ml dose.  \n \nFoclivia may contain trace residues of egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, \nneomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide which are used during the \nmanufacturing process (see section 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults (aged 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. \n \nHowever, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a \nhistory of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately \navailable in case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity to the \nactive substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to residues (eggs, chicken proteins, \novalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium \nbromide). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness \nuntil the fever is resolved. \n \nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There \nare no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. \n \nProtection against influenza \nThere is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. In addition, antibody \nresponses in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to \nprovide protection. \n \nSome degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to \nthat of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of \nother clades is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or \nefficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response \nto the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation \nshould be carried out on separate limbs. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be \ncarried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLimited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with \nFoclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-\nassociated risks in pregnancy. \n \nHowever, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were \nvaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which \ncontains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse \nevents and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria \nexposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of \nFocetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, \nabortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations \namong almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated \ncontrols. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks \nto the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive \nor developmental toxicity of Foclivia. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \n\u2022 Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in seven clinical trials in healthy subjects \ninvolving over 4300 adults and elderly receiving H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (at \nleast 7.5 \u00b5g haemagglutinin, HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain. There were 3872 subjects 18-60 years of age, 365 subjects 61-70 years \nof age, and 89 subjects greater than 70 years of age. The safety profile across clinical trials using \nH5N1 vaccine containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain is \ncomparable (see section 5.1). Clinical trials in 80 subjects receiving adjuvanted vaccine with an H5N3 \nor an H9N2 strain showed a similar safety profile. \n \nAcross all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of solicited local adverse \nreactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nIrrespective of antigen dose, almost all solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported on the day \nof vaccination (day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. \n \nData on safety of a booster dose are limited to three trials performed with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted \nvaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (V87P1, V87P2) or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (V87P1E1) \nthat included 116 adults (18-60 years) and 56 elderly subjects (\u226561 years). No increase in solicited \nadverse reactions was reported when a booster dose was administered 6 or 18 months after the initial \ndosing series. A slight increase in solicited adverse reactions in adults was reported when a booster \ndose was administered 18 months after the initial dosing series. In the elderly, the reported solicited \nadverse reactions increased with the third booster dose only when compared with the second dose. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reaction rates reported after any vaccination dose (i.e. 1st, 2nd or booster) were similar \nand are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: \nVery common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan class \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n\u02c21/1,000) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Sweating  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia Arthralgia  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nswelling, Injection \nsite pain, Injection \nsite induration, \nInjection site redness, \nFatigue, Chills, \nMalaise \n\nInjection site \necchymosis, Fever  \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nClinical trials in special populations \n \nAdverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and \nV87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (\u2265 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or \nwith underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. \n \n H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 vaccine \n Study V87_25 Study V87_26 \n Medical conditions Healthy Immunocompromi\n\nsed Healthy \n\n \nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(19-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-79 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(18-59 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-91 \nyears)*  \n\nNo. of \nsubjects N=145 N=149 N=59 N=58 N=147 N=148 N=58 N=62 \n\n*actual age range of population enrolled \n \nAcross studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and \nelderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in \nimmunocompromised subjects 18 through 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) \nwere reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and \nelderly subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. \n \nThe following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported \nwith the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 \nirrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and \nvomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive \nconditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy \nsubjects (irrespective of age). \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined \nwith MF59C.1 adjuvant (N=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (N=137). \n \nRegardless of age, reactogencity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after the third dose, administered 12 months following the second dose, was higher \nthan after both first and second doses. The percentages of subjects reporting local adverse reactions \nwere higher in the older age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema \nand tenderness were the most frequently reported solicited local adverse reactions; irritability and \nunusual crying were the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse reactions. In children and \nadolescents, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse reaction, and fatigue and \nheadache were the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse reactions. Across all ages, the \nfrequency of fever after any dose was not more than 6%.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n Study V87P6  \nH5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine  \n\n First dose Second dose (21 days \nafter first dose) \n\nThird dose (12 months \nafter second dose) \n\nToddlers (6 to 35  months) N=145 N=138 N=124 \nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 0% 0% 0%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 54% 49% 35% \n\nChildren (3 to 8 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 36% 31% 19% \nAdolescents(9 to 17 years) N=93 N=91 N=83 \nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse Event 30% 27% 22% \n\n \nFocetria (an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia). \n \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from 77 children 3-8 years \nold and 80 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported \nas follows: \n \n\n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N= 77 N= 75 \n\nAny adverse reaction  74%  69% \nLocal  62%  56% \nSystemic  39%  35% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  4% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  14%  17% \n\nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N= 80 N= 79 \nAny adverse reaction  79%  66% \nLocal  70%  58% \nSystemic  45%  30% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  3% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 0% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  13%  10% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from \n73 infants 6-11 months old and 73 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were \nreported as follows: \n \n\n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N= 73 N= 68 \n\nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44%  26% \nSystemic  70%  56% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C   11%  9% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C  3% 4% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  32%  31% \n\nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N= 73 N= 71 \nAny adverse reaction 70%  71% \nLocal  51%  49% \nSystemic  60%  49% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  10% 11% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 4% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21%  24% \n\n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 146 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting and change in eating \nhabits.

CHMP immunogenicity criteria \nset for adults (18-60 years) were met both after the 1st and the 2nd dose in all the above age strata (both \nin the overall population and in the subset seronegative at baseline). \n \nThe European medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFoclivia in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in active immunisation against \nH5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nFoclivia has been authorised under \u201cExceptional Circumstances\u201d. \nThis means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which \nmay become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data obtained with Foclivia and with seasonal influenza vaccine containing \nMF59C.1 adjuvant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (through \nthe end of the lactation period). \n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFoclivia suspension for injection \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)* of strain: \n \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms** \nper 0.5 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens\u2019 eggs from healthy chicken flocks \n** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin. \n \nAdjuvant MF59C.1 containing: \nSqualene 9.75 milligrams \nPolysorbate 80 1.175 milligrams \nSorbitan trioleate 1.175 milligrams \nSodium citrate 0.66 milligrams \nCitric acid 0.04 milligrams \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendations and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nThe vaccine contains 1.899 milligrams of sodium and 0.081 milligrams of potassium per 0.5 ml dose.  \n \nFoclivia may contain trace residues of egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, \nneomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide which are used during the \nmanufacturing process (see section 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults (aged 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be \nappropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided \nthat facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity to the \nactive substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to residues (eggs, chicken proteins, \novalbumin, kanamycin sulphate, neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium \nbromide). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness \nuntil the fever is resolved. \n \nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There \nare no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. \n \nProtection against influenza \nThere is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. In addition, antibody \nresponses in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to \nprovide protection. \n \nSome degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to \nthat of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of \nother clades is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity \nor efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation \nshould be carried out on separate limbs. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be \ncarried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLimited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with \nFoclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-\nassociated risks in pregnancy. \n \nHowever, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were \nvaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which \ncontains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse \nevents and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria \nexposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of \nFocetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, \nabortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations \namong almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated \ncontrols. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks \nto the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive \nor developmental toxicity of Foclivia. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8  may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \n\u2022 Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in seven clinical trials in healthy subjects \ninvolving over 4300 adults and elderly receiving H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (at \nleast 7.5 \u00b5g haemagglutinin, HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain. There were 3872 subjects 18-60 years of age, 365 subjects 61-70 years \nof age, and 89 subjects greater than 70 years of age. The safety profile across clinical trials using \nH5N1 vaccine containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain is \ncomparable (see section 5.1). Clinical trials in 80 subjects receiving adjuvanted vaccine with an H5N3 \nor an H9N2 strain showed a similar safety profile. \n \nAcross all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of solicited local adverse \nreactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nIrrespective of antigen dose, almost all solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported on the day \nof vaccination (day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. \n \nData on safety of a booster dose are limited to three trials performed with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted \nvaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (V87P1, V87P2) or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  (V87P1E1) \nthat included 116 adults (18-60 years) and 56 elderly subjects (\u226561 years). No increase in solicited \nadverse reactions was reported when a booster dose was administered 6 or 18 months, after the initial \ndosing series. A slight increase in solicited adverse reactions in adults was reported when a booster \ndose was administered 18 months after the initial dosing series. In the elderly, the reported solicited \nadverse reactions increased with the third booster dose only when compared with the second dose. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reaction rates reported after any vaccination dose (i.e. 1st, 2nd or booster) were similar \nand are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: \nVery common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan class \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n\u02c21/1,000) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Sweating  \n\n\n\n24 \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nswelling, Injection \nsite pain, Injection \nsite induration, \nInjection site redness, \nFatigue, Chills, \nMalaise \n\nInjection site \necchymosis, Fever  \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nClinical trials in special populations \n \nAdverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and \nV87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (\u2265 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or \nwith underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. \n \n H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 vaccine \n Study V87_25 Study V87_26 \n Medical conditions Healthy Immunocompromi\n\nsed Healthy \n\n \nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(19-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-79 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(18-59 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-91 \nyears)*  \n\nNo. of \nsubjects N=145 N=149 N=59 N=58 N=147 N=148 N=58 N=62 \n\n*actual age range of population enrolled \n \nAcross studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and \nelderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in \nimmunocompromised subjects 18 through 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) \nwere reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and \nelderly subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. \n \nThe following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported \nwith the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 \nirrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and \nvomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive \nconditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy \nsubjects (irrespective of age). \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined \nwith MF59C.1 adjuvant (N=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (N=137). \n \nRegardless  of age, reactogencity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after the third dose, administered 12 months following the second dose, was higher \nthan after both first and second doses. The percentages of subjects reporting local adverse reactions \nwere higher in the older age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. \nFoclivia should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nFoclivia was evaluated in adults (aged 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years old) following \na 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule. \n \nData on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Foclivia in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in section 5.1 but \nno recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(eggs, chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate,  neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be \nappropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided \nthat facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity  to the \nactive substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to thiomersal and to residues (eggs, \nchicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin sulphate,  neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness \nuntil the fever is resolved. \n \nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. There \nare no data with Foclivia using the subcutaneous route of administration. Healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. \n \nProtection against influenza \nThere is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1).  \n\n\n\n40 \n\nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. In addition, antibody \nresponses in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to \nprovide protection. \n \nSome degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to \nthat of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of \nother clades is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity \nor efficacy data to support interchangeability of Foclivia with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \nWhile no data are available from the use of Foclivia, cases of convulsion with and without fever have \nbeen reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria, an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine \nsimilar to Foclivia. \n \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (see section 4.8). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFoclivia may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation \nshould be carried out on separate limbs. \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Foclivia with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be \ncarried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLimited data obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with \nFoclivia or other pandemic vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-\nassociated risks in pregnancy. \n \nHowever, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were \nvaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia) which \ncontains the same amount of MF59C.1 as Foclivia. Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse \nevents and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria \nexposure on pregnancy. In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of \nFocetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, \nabortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations \namong almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated \ncontrols. \n \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Foclivia vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n41 \n\nThere are no data regarding the use of Foclivia during breast-feeding. The potential benefits and risks \nto the mother and infant should be considered before administering Foclivia. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data concerning human fertility. A study in female rabbits did not indicate reproductive \nor developmental toxicity of Foclivia. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8  may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \n\u2022 Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in adults and elderly (above 18 years old) \nThe incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in seven clinical trials in healthy subjects \ninvolving over 4300 adults and elderly receiving H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant (at \nleast 7.5 \u00b5g haemagglutinin, HA) containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain. There were 3872 subjects 18-60 years of age, 365 subjects 61-70 years \nof age, and 89 subjects greater than 70 years of age. The safety profile across clinical trials using \nH5N1 vaccine containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain is \ncomparable (see section 5.1). Clinical trials in 80 subjects receiving adjuvanted vaccine with an H5N3 \nor an H9N2 strain showed a similar safety profile. \n \nAcross all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of solicited local adverse \nreactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nIrrespective of antigen dose, almost all solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported on the day \nof vaccination (day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. \n \nData on safety of a booster dose are limited to three trials performed with H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted \nvaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (V87P1, V87P2) or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (V87P1E1) \nthat included 116 adults (18-60 years) and 56 elderly subjects (\u226561 years). No increase in solicited \nadverse reactions was reported when a booster dose was administered 6 or 18 months after the initial \ndosing series. A slight increase in solicited adverse reactions in adults was reported when a booster \ndose was administered 18 months after the initial dosing series. In the elderly, the reported solicited \nadverse reactions increased with the third booster dose only when compared with the second dose. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reaction rates reported after any vaccination dose (i.e. 1st, 2nd or booster) were similar \nand are listed according to the following MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class: \nVery common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan class \n\nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n\u02c21/1,000) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   \n\n\n\n42 \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Sweating  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nswelling, Injection \nsite pain, Injection \nsite induration, \nInjection site redness, \nFatigue, Chills, \nMalaise \n\nInjection site \necchymosis, Fever  \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\n \nThe majority of these reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nClinical trials in special populations \n \nAdverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87_25 and \nV87_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (\u2265 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or \nwith underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions. \n \n H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 vaccine \n Study V87_25 Study V87_26 \n Medical conditions Healthy Immunocompromi\n\nsed Healthy \n\n \nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(19-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-79 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(20-60 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-84 \nyears)* \n\nAdults \n(18-59 \nyears)* \n\nElderly \n(61-91 \nyears)*  \n\nNo. of \nsubjects N=145 N=149 N=59 N=58 N=147 N=148 N=58 N=62 \n\n*actual age range of population enrolled \n \nAcross studies V87_25 and V87_26, the safety of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in healthy adult and \nelderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in \nimmunocompromised subjects 18 through 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) \nwere reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and \nelderly subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions. \n \nThe following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported \nwith the following frequencies across subjects who received H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 \nirrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea (up to 11.9%), loss of appetite (up to 10.9%) and \nvomiting (up to 1.7%). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive \nconditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy \nsubjects (irrespective of age).    \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children aged 6 months to 17 years \nA clinical trial (Study V87P6) was conducted with a H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine combined \nwith MF59C.1 adjuvant (N=334) vs seasonal influenza vaccine (N=137). \n \nRegardless of age, reactogencity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after the third dose, administered 12 months following the second dose, was higher \nthan after both first and second doses. The percentages of subjects reporting local adverse reactions \n\n\n\n43 \n\nwere higher in the older age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain. In toddlers, erythema \nand tenderness were the most frequently reported solicited local adverse reactions; irritability and \nunusual crying were the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse reactions. In children and \nadolescents, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse reaction, and fatigue and \nheadache were the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse reactions. Across all ages, the \nfrequency of fever after any dose was not more than 6%.  \n \n\n Study V87P6 \nH5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine \n\n First dose \nSecond \n\ndose (21 days after \nfirst dose) \n\nThird dose \n(12 months after \n\nsecond dose) \nToddlers (6 to \n\n35 months) \nN=145 N=138 N=124 \n\nAny 76% 68% 80% \nLocal 47% 46% 60% \nSystemic 59% 51% 54% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 0% 0% 0%  \nAny Other Adverse \nEvent \n\n54% 49% 35% \n\nChildren (3 to 8 years) N=96 N=93 N=85 \nAny 72% 68% 79% \nLocal 66% 58% 74% \nSystemic 32% 33% 45% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 4%  2%  6%  \nAny Other Adverse \nEvent \n\n36% 31% 19% \n\nAdolescents(9 to \n17 years) \n\nN=93 N=91 N=83 \n\nAny 91% 82% 89% \nLocal 81% 70% 81% \nSystemic 69% 52% 69% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C (\u2265 40\u00b0C) 0%  1%  2%  \nAny Other Adverse \nEvent \n\n30% 27% 22% \n\n \nFocetria (an MF59.1 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to Foclivia). \n \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from 77 children 3-8 years \nold and 80 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported as \nfollows: \n \n\n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N= 77 N= 75 \n\nAny adverse reaction  74%  69% \nLocal  62%  56% \nSystemic  39%  35% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  4% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  14%  17% \nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N= 80 N= 79 \n\nAny adverse reaction  79%  66% \nLocal  70%  58% \nSystemic  45%  30% \n\n\n\n44 \n\nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  3% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 0% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  13%  10% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination with Focetria H1N1v from \n73 infants 6-11 months old and 73 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were \nreported as follows: \n \n\n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N= 73 N= 68 \n\nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44%  26% \nSystemic  70%  56% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C   11%  9% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C  3% 4% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE  32%  31% \nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N= 73 N= 71 \n\nAny adverse reaction 70%  71% \nLocal  51%  49% \nSystemic  60%  49% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  10% 11% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 4% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21%  24% \n\n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 146 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting and change in eating \nhabits.

Neurological disorders, such as neuralgia, paraesthesia, \nconvulsions and neuritis. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash. \n \nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nThe following additional adverse events were reported from post-marketing surveillance with seasonal \nnon-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines in all age groups and a seasonal trivalent MF59-adjuvanted subunit \ninfluenza vaccine approved for use in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nThrombocytopenia (in some cases reversible platelet counts less than 5000 mm3). \n \nNervous system disorders \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis  and Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. \n \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis which may be associated with transient renal involvement. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nErythema multiforme. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nExtensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week, injection-site cellulitis-like reaction \n(some cases of swelling, pain, and redness extending more than 10 cm and lasting more than 1 week). \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC Code: J07BB02 \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the \ncurrently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as \u2018novel\u2019 antigens and \nsimulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically na\u00efve. Data \nobtained with a pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be \nused for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with pandemic preparedness \nvaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines. \n \nImmune response to H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant containing \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 or A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain. \n \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nA Phase II clinical trial (V87P1) was conducted with  H5N1  MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing  7.5 \u00b5g \nHaemagglutinin(HA)/dose were administered three weeks apart to 156 subjects. Immunogenicity was \nassessed in 149 subjects. \n \nIn a phase III clinical trial  (V87P13), 2693  adult subjects were enrolled and 2566 received two doses \nof H5N1 MF59C.1 adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 7.5 \u00b5g  HA/dose \nadministered three weeks apart.

OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING  \n\nAUTHORISATION \n \n\u2022 Periodic Safety Update Reports \n \nThe requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set \nout in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive \n2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. \n \nOutside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with \na specific review of AESI and possible adverse events related to adjuvants. This should include data \nfrom ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, of the pandemic preparedness strains and any safety \ndata relevant to the adjuvant system. \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring \nof the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic. Moreover, a 6-monthly cycle \nmay be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are \n\n\n\n58 \n\nexpected within a short period of time. Therefore, 6-monthly or annual PSURs falling within the \npandemic period will be replaced by monthly \u201csimplified PSURs\u201d (S-PSUR) accompanied by \na summary of vaccine distribution. \n \n\u2022 Frequency of submission: \n \n- The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n- First data-lock point is 30 days later. \n- S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45. \n- Rapporteur\u2019s assessment report is circulated to CHMP members on Day 50. \n- CHMP report is circulated to the vaccine manufacturer on Day 55. \n- Reporting to be monthly for the first 6 months. \n- Periodicity should be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6 monthly intervals. \n \nWhen it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering \nthe period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to \nbe agreed with the Rapporteur. \n \n\u2022 Format of the simplified PSUR: \n \nOnly spontaneously reported data should be included in the PSUR. The report should include the \nfollowing Tables of aggregate data (using the pre-defined templates attached in Annex 2). \n \n\n1. An overview for all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of report \n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by \nthe report and cumulatively. \n\n \n2. An overview for all spontaneous adverse reactions by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) and \n\nPreferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or \nnon-medically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period covered by \nthe report and cumulatively. \n\n \n3. Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed \n\nor non-medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows: \n \n\n- Neuritis: PT \u201cNeuritis\u201d \n- Convulsion: narrow SMQ \u201cConvulsions\u201d \n- Anaphylaxis: narrow SMQ \u201cAnaphylactic reaction\u201d and narrow SMQ \n\n\u201cAngioedema\u201d \n- Encephalitis: narrow SMQ \u201cNon-infectious encephalitis\u201d \n- Vasculitis: narrow SMQ \u201cVasculitis\u201d \n- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 narrow SMQ \u201cGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u201d \n\nsyndrome: \n- Demyelination: narrow SMQ \u201cDemyelination\u201d (as GBS is also included in this \n\nSMQ, there will be an overlap in the number of cases for these \ntwo categories). \n\n- Bell\u2019s palsy: PT \u201cBell\u2019s palsy\u201d \n- Vaccination failure: PT \u201cVaccination failure\u201d. \n\n \n4. Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PTs) stratified according to type of report \n\n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report and \ncumulatively. \n\n \n5. All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC, HLT and PT, stratified according \n\nto type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered \nby the report and cumulatively.

All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PT) occurring in pregnant women, stratified \n\naccording to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period \ncovered by the report and cumulatively. \n\n \nThe following principles should be followed when compiling the data: \n \n- Except for Table 1, all tables will be based on number of reactions (presented on PT level, \n\nsorted by System Organ Class [SOC] and High Level Term [HLT]) and not number of cases. \n- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data1. Product-specific data can be \n\nevaluated during signal work-up. \n- \u201cCumulatively\u201d means since the use of the vaccine; events not reported during the period of \n\ninterest should not be presented in the tables. \n- All non-medically confirmed events are those that have been entered into the database by the \n\ndata-lock point. Those which have not yet been entered should be reported in the following \nS-PSUR. \n\n- A line listing of fatal cases will be provided in an Annex. \n \nA short summary should be provided in which validated signals and areas of concern are highlighted, \ntaking into account information arising from the prospective cohort study described in 4.5.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Foclivia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n3. How Foclivia is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Foclivia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Foclivia is and what it is used for \n \nFoclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nIt is for use in adults (from 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years) to prevent flu caused by the \nH5N1 type of the virus. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body\u2019s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n \nFoclivia should not be given if you: \n- have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of Foclivia, \n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, \n- are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin, \n- are allergic to kanamycin sulphate and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), formaldehyde, \n\ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine: \n \n- if you feel feverish, \n- if you have any illness or infection, \n- if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for \n\ncancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency \nconditions). \n\n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have \nhad previous history of epilepsy. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse \nif you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nFoclivia may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with \nweakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical \nproblems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak \nimmune system or an underlying long term medical problem. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Foclivia \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \nFoclivia can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no \ninformation on administration of Foclivia with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Foclivia \nwith other vaccines cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such \ncases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of giving you the vaccine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome side effects listed in Section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect your ability to drive or use \ntools or machines.  \n \nFoclivia contains sodium and potassium \nFoclivia contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per \ndose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n3. How Foclivia is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse administers the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, \ndepending on the muscle mass. \n \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Foclivia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Foclivia in clinical studies in adults, including \nthe elderly: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10): \n\u2022 Pain at the site of injection \n\u2022 Hardening of the skin at the injection site \n\u2022 Injection site redness  \n\u2022 Injection site swelling \n\u2022 Aching muscles \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Fatigue \n\u2022 Generally feeling unwell \n\u2022 Shivering \n \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): \n\u2022 Brusing of the skin at the injection site \n\u2022 Aching joints \n\u2022 Fever and nausea \n\u2022 Sweating \n \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): \n\u2022 Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nUndesirable effects in patients with underlying long term medical problems such as diabetes, lung \ndisease or heart problems and weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) such as HIV \npatients \nNausea, aching joints, diarrhoea and loss of appetite were reported very commonly in this population. \nIn addition, vomiting was commonly reported.   \n \nSide effects from clinical study in children (6 months to 17 years of age) \nGeneral side effects reported very commonly in the 6 months to 35 months of age group were \ninjection site redness, muscle ache, irritability and unusual crying. Very commonly reported reactions \nin the 36 months to 17 years of age group were pain, headache and fatigue. \n \nOther rare side effects observed after routine use \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with another \nvaccine called Focetria H1N1v similar to Foclivia. These side effects may occur with Foclivia.  \n  \n\u2022 Generalised skin reactions including  \n\n\u2022 Itching \n\u2022 Urticaria (hives) \n\u2022 Rash or swelling of the skin and mucous membranes \n\n \n\u2022 Disorders of the gut such as  \n\n\u2022 Nausea \n\u2022 Vomiting \n\n\n\n78 \n\n\u2022 Abdominal pain  \n\u2022 Diarrhoea \n\n \n\u2022 Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. \n\n \n\u2022 Neurological disorders such as  \n\n\u2022 Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \n\u2022 Tingling \n\u2022 Fits \n\u2022 Neuritis (inflammation of nerves) \n\n \n\u2022 Swollen lymph nodes, palpitations (irregular or forceful heart beat), tachycardia (faster than \n\nnormal heart beat), weakness, pain in the extremities, cough and asthenia (unusual weakness). \n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading \n\nto a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are \naware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n\n \n\u2022 Angioedema (abnormal swelling of the skin, usually around the eyes, lips, tongue, hands or feet, \n\ndue to an allergic reaction). \n \nData in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in side effects after the second dose of the \nvaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nIn addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with \nvaccines given routinely every year to prevent seasonal flu. These side effects may occur with \nFoclivia. \n \n\u2022 Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising. \n\u2022 Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \n\nproblems). \n\u2022 Erythema multiforme (type of allergic skin reaction that occurs in response to medications, \n\ninfections, or illness). \n\u2022 Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), \n\nand a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. \n\u2022 Swelling, pain and redness at the injection site extending to more than 10 cm and lasting more \n\nthan one week (Injection site cellulitis-like reaction). \n\u2022 Extensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n3. How Foclivia is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Foclivia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Foclivia is and what it is used for \n \nFoclivia is a vaccine intended to be given to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nIt is for use in adults (from 18 to 60 years old) and elderly (over 60 years) to prevent flu caused by the \nH5N1 type of the virus. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body\u2019s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Foclivia may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Foclivia \n \nFoclivia should not be given if you: \n- have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of \n\nFoclivia, \n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, \n- are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin, \n- are allergic to kanamycin sulphate and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), formaldehyde, \n\ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine: \n \n- if you feel feverish, \n- if you have any illness or infection, \n- if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for \n\ncancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency \nconditions). \n\n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have \nhad previous history of epilepsy. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse \nif you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nFoclivia may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with \nweakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical \nproblems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak \nimmune system or an underlying long term medical problem. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Foclivia \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.  \n \nFoclivia can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no \ninformation on administration of Foclivia with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Foclivia \nwith other vaccines cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such \ncases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of giving you the vaccine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome side effects listed in Section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect your ability to drive or use \ntools or machines.  \n \nFoclivia contains thiomersal \nFoclivia contains Thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic \nreaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \nFoclivia contains sodium and potassium \nFoclivia contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per \ndose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n3. How Foclivia is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse administers the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, \n\n\n\n89 \n\ndepending on the muscle mass. \n \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Foclivia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Foclivia in clinical studies in adults, including \nthe elderly: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10): \n\u2022 Pain at the site of injection \n\u2022 Hardening of the skin at the injection site \n\u2022 Injection site redness  \n\u2022 Injection site swelling \n\u2022 Aching muscles \n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Fatigue \n\u2022 Generally feeling unwell \n\u2022 Shivering \n \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): \n\u2022 Brusing of the skin at the injection site \n\u2022 Aching joints \n\u2022 Fever and nausea \n\u2022 Sweating \n \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): \n\u2022 Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nUndesirable effects in patients with underlying long term medical problems such as diabetes, lung \ndisease or heart problems and weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) such as HIV \npatients \nNausea, aching joints, diarrhoea and loss of appetite were reported very commonly in this population. \nIn addition, vomiting was commonly reported.   \n \nSide effects from clinical study in children (6 months to 17 years of age) \nGeneral side effects reported very commonly in the 6 months to 35 months of age group were \ninjection site redness, muscle ache, irritability and unusual crying.

redness injection site swelling aching muscles headache fatigue generally feeling unwell shivering common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): brusing of the skin at the injection site aching joints fever and nausea sweating rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) these side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. if they persist, consult your doctor. undesirable effects in patients with underlying long term medical problems such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems and weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) such as hiv patients nausea, aching joints, diarrhoea and loss of appetite were reported very commonly in this population. in addition, vomiting was commonly reported. side effects from clinical study in children (6 months to 17 years of age) general side effects reported very commonly in the 6 months to 35 months of age group were injection site redness, muscle ache, irritability and unusual crying. very commonly reported reactions in the 36 months to 17 years of age group were pain, headache and fatigue. other rare side effects observed after routine use the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with another vaccine called focetria h1n1v similar to foclivia. these side effects may occur with foclivia. generalised skin reactions including itching urticaria (hives) rash or swelling of the skin and mucous membranes disorders of the gut such as nausea vomiting 78 abdominal pain diarrhoea headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. neurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves tingling fits neuritis (inflammation of nerves) swollen lymph nodes, palpitations (irregular or forceful heart beat), tachycardia (faster than normal heart beat), weakness, pain in the extremities, cough and asthenia (unusual weakness). allergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. angioedema (abnormal swelling of the skin, usually around the eyes, lips, tongue, hands or feet, due to an allergic reaction). data in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in side effects after the second dose of the vaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. in addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given routinely every year to prevent seasonal flu. these side effects may occur with foclivia. low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising. vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems). erythema multiforme (type of allergic skin reaction that occurs in response to medications, infections, or illness). neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), and a type of paralysis known as guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome. swelling, pain and redness at the injection site extending to more than 10 cm and lasting more than one week (injection site cellulitis-like reaction). extensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week. reporting of side effects if you
