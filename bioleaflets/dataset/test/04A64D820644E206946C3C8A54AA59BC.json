CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBlitzima is indicated in adults for the following indications:  \n\n \n\nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) \n\n \n\nBlitzima is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated adult patients with stage III-IV \n\nfollicular lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nBlitzima maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of adult follicular lymphoma \n\npatients responding to induction therapy. \n\n \n\nBlitzima monotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients with stage III-IV follicular \n\nlymphoma who are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nBlitzima is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \n\n\n\n3  \n\nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \n\nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nBlitzima in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients \n\n(aged \u2265 6 months  to < 18 years old) with previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive \n\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell \n\nacute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL). \n\n \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n\n \n\nBlitzima in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously \n\nuntreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for \n\npatients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including Blitzima or patients refractory to \n\nprevious Blitzima plus chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nSee section 5.1 for further information. \n\n \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n\n \n\nBlitzima, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \n\nsevere, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis \n\n(MPA). \n\n \n\nBlitzima, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in \n\npaediatric patients (aged \u2265 2 to < 18 years old) with severe, active GPA (Wegener\u2019s) and MPA. \n\n \n\nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nBlitzima is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nBlitzima should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \n\nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nPremedication and prophylactic medications \n\n \n\nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \n\ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Blitzima. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should \n\nbe considered if Blitzima is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. \n\nIn paediatric patients with non Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, premedication with paracetamol and H1 \n\nantihistamine (= diphenhydramine or equivalent) should be administered 30 to 60 minutes before the \n\nstart of the infusion of Blitzima. In addition, prednisone should be given as indicated in Table 1. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start \n\nof therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL \n\npatients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \n\nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Blitzima to decrease the rate \n\nand severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n\n \n\nIn patients with GPA or MPA in disease remission or pemphigus vulgaris, premedication with 100 \n\nmg intravenous methylprednisolone should be completed 30 minutes prior to each infusion of \n\nBlitzima to decrease the incidence and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs). \n\n \n\n\n\n4  \n\nIn adult patients with GPA or MPA, methylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a \n\ndose of 1000 mg per day is recommended prior to the first infusion of Blitzima (the last dose of \n\nmethylprednisolone may be given on the same day as the first infusion of Blitzima). This should be \n\nfollowed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as \n\npossible based on clinical need) during and after the 4 week induction course of Blitzima treatment. \n\n \n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis is recommended for adult patients with \n\nGPA/MPA or PV during and following rituximab treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical \n\npractice guidelines. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn paediatric patients with GPA or MPA, prior to the first Blitzima IV infusion, methylprednisolone \n\nshould be given IV for three daily doses of 30 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 1 g/day) to treat severe \n\nvasculitis symptoms. Up to three additional daily doses of 30 mg/kg IV methylprednisolone can be \n\ngiven prior to the first Blitzima infusion. \n\n \n\nFollowing completion of IV methylprednisolone administration, patients should receive oral \n\nprednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 60 mg/day) and tapered as rapidly as possible per clinical need \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis is recommended for paediatric patients with \n\nGPA or MPA during and following Blitzima treatment, as appropriate. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\n \n\nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n\n \n\nCombination therapy \n\nThe recommended dose of Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \n\npreviously untreated or relapsed/refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \n\nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \n\n \n\nBlitzima should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \n\nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n\n \n\nMaintenance therapy \n\n\u2022 Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \n\nThe recommended dose of Blitzima used as a maintenance treatment for patients with previously \n\nuntreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 body \n\nsurface area once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until \n\ndisease progression or for a maximum period of two years (12 infusions in total). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \n\nThe recommended dose of Blitzima used as a maintenance treatment for patients with \n\nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 \n\nbody surface area once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) \n\nuntil disease progression or for a maximum period of two years (8 infusions in total). \n\n \n\nMonotherapy \n\n\u2022 Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \n\nThe recommended dose of Blitzima monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \n\nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \n\nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \n\nweekly for four weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n5  \n\nFor retreatment with Blitzima monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \n\nwith Blitzima monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n\n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAdult Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n\n \n\nBlitzima should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n\n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \n\nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of Blitzima \n\nhave not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell \n\nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments during treatment \n\n \n\nNo dose reductions of Blitzima are recommended. When Blitzima is given in combination with \n\nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \n\napplied. \n\n \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage of Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \n\nand relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first \n\ntreatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each \n\nsubsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Blitzima infusion. \n\n \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n\n \n\nPatients treated with Blitzima must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n\n \n\nAdult induction of remission \n\nThe recommended dosage of Blitzima for induction of remission therapy in adult patients with \n\nGPA and MPA is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \n\nweekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total).  \n\n \n\nAdult maintenance treatment \n\nFollowing induction of remission with Blitzima, maintenance treatment in adult patients with \n\nGPA and MPA should be initiated no sooner than 16 weeks after the last Blitzima infusion. \n\n \n\nFollowing induction of remission with other standard of care immunosuppressants, Blitzima \n\nmaintenance treatment should be initiated during the 4 week period that follows disease \n\nremission.  \n\n \n\nBlitzima should be administered as two 500 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, followed \n\nby a 500 mg IV infusion every 6 months thereafter. Patients should receive Blitzima for at least \n\n24 months after achievement of remission (absence of clinical signs and symptoms). For patients \n\nwho may be at higher risk for relapse, physicians should consider a longer duration of Blitzima \n\nmaintenance therapy, up to 5 years. \n\n \n\nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nPatients treated with Blitzima must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage of Blitzima for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris is 1000 mg \n\nadministered as an IV infusion followed two weeks later by a second 1000 mg IV infusion in \n\ncombination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. \n\n \n\n\n\n6  \n\nMaintenance treatment \n\nA maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 \n\nmonths thereafter if needed, based on clinical evaluation. \n\n \n\nTreatment of relapse \n\nIn the event of relapse, patients may receive 1000 mg IV. The healthcare provider should also consider \n\nresuming or increasing the patient\u2019s glucocorticoid dose based on clinical evaluation.  \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions may be administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged > 65 years). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\n \n\nIn paediatric patients from \u2265 6 months to < 18 years of age with previously untreated, advanced stage \n\nCD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL, Blitzima should be used in combination with systemic \n\nLymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy (see Tables 1 and 2). The recommended dosage of \n\nBlitzima is 375mg/m2 BSA, administered as an IV infusion. No Blitzima dose adjustments, other than \n\nby BSA, are required. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Blitzima paediatric patients \u2265 6 months to < 18 years of age has not been \n\nestablished in indications other than previously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive \n\nDLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. Only limited data are available for patients under 3 years of age. See section \n\n5.1 for further information.  \n\n \n\nBlitzima should not be used in paediatric patients from birth to < 6 months of age with CD20 positive \n\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (see section 5.1) \n\nTable 1 Posology of Blitzima administration for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma paediatric \n\npatients \n\nCycle Day of treatment Administration details \n\nPrephase (COP) No Blitzima given - \n\nInduction course 1 \n\n(COPDAM1) \n\nDay -2 \n\n(corresponding to day 6 \n\nof the prephase) \n\n1st Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\nDuring the 1st induction course, prednisone is \n\ngiven as part of the chemotherapy course, and \n\nshould be administered prior to Blitzima. \n\nDay 1 \n\n2nd Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\nBlitzima will be given 48 hours after thefirst \n\ninfusion of Blitzima. \n\nInduction course 2 \n\n(COPDAM2) \n\nDay -2 \n\n3rd Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\nIn the 2nd induction course, prednisone is not \n\ngiven at the time of Blitzima administration. \n\nDay 1 \n\n4th Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\nBlitzima will be given 48 hours after the third \n\ninfusion of Blitzima. \n\nConsolidation \n\ncourse 1 \n\n(CYM/CYVE) \n\nDay 1 \n\n5th Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\nPrednisone is not given at the time of Blitzima \n\nadministration. \n\nConsolidation \n\ncourse 2 \n\nDay 1 \n\n6th Blitzima infusion \n\n \n\n\n\n7  \n\n(CYM/CYVE) Prednisone is not given at the time of Blitzima \n\nadministration. \n\nMaintenance \n\ncourse 1 (M1) \n\nDay 25 to 28 of \n\nconsolidation course 2 \n\n(CYVE) \n\nNo Blitzima given \n\n \n\nStarts when peripheral counts have recovered \n\nfrom consolidation course 2 (CYVE) with ANC> \n\n1.0 x 109/l and platelets > 100 x 109/l  \n\nMaintenance \n\ncourse 2 (M2) \n\nDay 28 of maintenance \n\ncourse 1 (M1) \n\nNo Blitzima given \n\n- \n\nANC = Absolute Neutrophil Count; COP = Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Prednisone; COPDAM = Cyclophosphamide, \n\nVincristine, Prednisolone, Doxorubicin, Methotrexate; CYM = CYtarabine (Aracytine, Ara-C), Methotrexate; CYVE = \n\nCYtarabine (Aracytine, Ara-C), VEposide (VP16)  \n\n \n\nTable 2 Treatment Plan for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma paediatric patients: Concomitant \n\nChemotherapy with Blitzima  \n\nTreatment \n\nPlan \n\nPatient Staging Administration details \n\nGroup B Stage III with high LDH level (> N x \n\n2), \n\nStage IV CNS negative \n\nPrephase followed by 4 courses:  \n\n2 induction courses (COPADM) with \n\nHDMTX 3g/m2 and 2 consolidation courses \n\n(CYM)  \n\nGroup C Group C1: \n\nB- AL CNS negative, Stage IV & BAL \n\nCNS positive and CSF negative \n\nPrephase followed by 6 courses:  \n\n2 induction courses (COPADM) with \n\nHDMTX 8g/m\u00b2, 2 consolidation courses \n\n(CYVE) and 2 maintenance courses  (M1 \n\nand M2)  \nGroup C3: \n\nBAL CSF positive, Stage IV CSF \n\npositive \n\nConsecutive courses should be given as soon as blood count recovery and patient\u2019s condition allows \n\nexcept for the maintenance courses which are given at 28 day intervals \nBAL = Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia); CSF = Cerebrospinal  Fluid; CNS = Central Nervous System; \n\nHDMTX = High-dose Methotrexate; LDH = Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase \n\n \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n\nInduction of remission \n\nThe recommended dosage of Blitzima for induction of remission therapy in paediatric patients with \n\nsevere, active GPA or MPA is 375 mg/m2 BSA, administered as an IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Blitzima in paediatric patients (\u2265 2 to < 18 years of age) has not been \n\nestablished in indications other than severe, active GPA or MPA. \n\n \n\nBlitzima should not be used in paediatric patients less than 2 years of age with severe, active GPA or \n\nMPA as there is a possibility of an inadequate immune response towards childhood vaccinations \n\nagainst common, vaccine preventable childhood diseases (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, and \n\npoliomyelitis) (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nThe prepared Blitzima solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a \n\ndedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n\n \n\nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \n\nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory \n\ntests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be \n\n\n\n8  \n\nrestarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest \n\nX-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the \n\nprevious rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the \n\ntreatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n\n \n\nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a \n\nreduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of \n\nsymptoms. \n\n \n\nFirst infusion \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated \n\nin 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions \n\n \n\nAll indications \n\n \n\nSubsequent doses of Blitzima can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n\n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \u2013 non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\n \n\nFirst infusion  \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 0.5 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it can be escalated by \n\n0.5 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes if there is no hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions, to a \n\nmaximum of 400 mg/h. \n\n \n\nSubsequent infusions  \n\n \n\nSubsequent doses of Blitzima can be infused at an initial rate of 1 mg/kg/h (maximum 50 mg/h); it can \n\nbe increased by 1 mg/kg/h every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\n \n\nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n\n \n\nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \n\npolyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\n \n\nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n\n \n\nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n\n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n\n\n\n9  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \n\nthe administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\n \n\nAll patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, GPA, MPA or pemphigus vulgaris must \n\nbe given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card contains important safety information \n\nfor patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, including PML. \n\n \n\nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be \n\nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \n\nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \n\nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \n\nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \n\nConsultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \n\nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \n\nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \n\ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \n\npatient is not aware of. \n\n \n\nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued.  \n\n \n\nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \n\nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML \n\nand suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n\n \n\nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \n\nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable \n\nfrom acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n\n \n\nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \n\nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. \n\n \n\nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use \n\nof the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \n\nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and \n\nin some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to \n\nfever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \n\nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \n\nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \n\nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \n\ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \n\nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or \n\n\n\n10  \n\noedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours \n\nof initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with \n\npulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with \n\nincreased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion \n\ninterrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. \n\nSince initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients \n\nshould be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been \n\nresolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms \n\nhas rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n\n \n\nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (\u2265 25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant \n\ncells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release \n\nsyndrome, should be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored \n\nthroughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for \n\nthe first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any \n\nsubsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still > 25 x 109/L. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \n\nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n\n10% of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \n\nrituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic and occasionally oxygen, \n\nintravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release \n\nsyndrome above for severe reactions. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \n\nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \n\nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment \n\nof hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, \n\nshould be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \n\nrituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of \n\nthe cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been \n\nreported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n\n \n\nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \n\noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \n\nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \n\nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a \n\nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n\n \n\nHaematological toxicities \n\nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \n\nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L \n\nas clinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \n\nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable \n\nreduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n\n \n\nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \n\nrituximab therapy. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \n\nRituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \n\n\n\n11  \n\nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history \n\nof recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \n\npatients to serious infection (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \n\nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \n\nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n\n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At \n\nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \n\nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not \n\nbe treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) \n\nshould consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed \n\nfollowing local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \n\nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \n\npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \n\nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplant. \n\n \n\nImmunisations \n\nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been \n\nstudied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. \n\nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations; however, with non-live vaccines \n\nresponse rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, adult patients with relapsed low-grade \n\nNHL who received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower \n\nrate of response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \n\nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). \n\nFor CLL patients, similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but \n\nthat has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \n\nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \n\nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \n\nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nOnly limited data are available for patients under 3 years of age. See section 5.1 for further \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and \n\npemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nMethotrexate (MTX) na\u00efve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \n\nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-na\u00efve patients since a favourable benefit risk \n\nrelationship has not been established. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \n\ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators.  \n\n \n\nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \n\n\n\n12  \n\npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \n\nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like \n\nheadache, pruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, \n\nthe proportion of patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion \n\nthan following the second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with \n\nsubsequent courses (see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction \n\nin rate, or interruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, \n\nand, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. \n\nClosely monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \n\ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \n\ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be \n\nresumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have \n\ncompletely resolved. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \n\nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \n\nreaction during administration of rituximab. \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \n\nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \n\npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \n\nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \n\nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular \n\ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab \n\nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \n\ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours \n\nprior to the rituximab infusion. \n\n \n\nIRRs in patients with GPA, MPA and pemphigus vulgaris were consistent with those seen for \n\nrheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \n\nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with \n\na history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion-related reactions, above). \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important \n\nrole in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \n\nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \n\nwith rituximab (see section 4.8). Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, \n\nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \n\nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \n\nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \n\nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \n\ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \n\nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. \n\n \n\nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly \n\nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, \n\npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n\n \n\nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \n\nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \n\nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B Infections \n\n\n\n13  \n\nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, GPA and MPA patients receiving rituximab. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \n\nwith rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \n\ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \n\ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \n\nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \n\nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \n\nLate neutropenia \n\nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months \n\nafter cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \n\nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In \n\ncase of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nImmunisation \n\nPhysicians should review the patient\u2019s vaccination status and patients should, if possible, be \n\nbrought up-to-date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior \n\nto rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first administration \n\nof rituximab. \n\n \n\nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \n\nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst \n\nperipherally B cell depleted. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations; however, response rates to non-live \n\nvaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \n\nrituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), \n\nreduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal \n\nantibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as \n\ncompared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst \n\nreceiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next \n\ncourse of rituximab. \n\n \n\nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \n\nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, \n\nrubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n\n \n\nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \n\nThe concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \n\nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \n\nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The \n\navailable data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such \n\ntherapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely \n\nobserved for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nMalignancy \n\nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of \n\nlimited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data \n\n\n\n14  \n\ndo not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the \n\ndevelopment of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n\n \n\nExcipients  \n\nThis medicinal product contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 mL vial and 11.5 mmol (or \n\n263.2 mg) sodium per 50 mL vial, equivalent to 2.6% (for 10ml vial) and 13.2% (for 50ml vial) of the \n\nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with rituximab. \n\n \n\nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \n\npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \n\nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab \n\nin rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \n\nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic \n\nmonoclonal antibodies. \n\n \n\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \n\nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \n\nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment \n\nwith the biologic DMARD. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\n \n\nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \n\npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following \n\ntreatment with rituximab. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \n\nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \n\nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \n\nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \n\nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n\n(see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless \n\nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \n\nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women \n\nshould not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n\n \n\n\n\n15  \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \n\nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab \n\nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nExperience from non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adult \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \n\npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \n\nwith rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \n\ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \n\nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of \n\ninfusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after \n\neight doses of rituximab. \n\n \n\nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of \n\npatients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials \n\nin patients with CLL \n\n \n\nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were: \n\n\uf09f IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n\n\uf09f Infections, see section 4.4. \n\n\uf09f Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy \n\nare summarised in Table 3. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 \n\nto < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< \n\n1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could \n\nnot be estimated, are listed under \u201cnot known\u201d. \n\n \n\nTable 3  ADRs reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in  \n\npatients with NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab \n\nmonotherapy/maintenance or in combination with chemotherapy \nMedDRA \n\nSystem organ \n\nclass \n\nVery \n\nCommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \n\nand \n\ninfestations \n\nbacterial \n\ninfections, \n\nviral \n\ninfections, \n+bronchitis \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \n\ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \n\ntract infection, \n\nfungal \n\ninfections, \n\n serious viral \n\ninfection2 \n\npneumocystis \n\njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\n\n\n16  \n\ninfections of \n\nunknown \n\naetiology, \n+acute \n\nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \n\nhepatitis B1 \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \n\nleucopenia, \n+febrile \n\nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyto\n\npenia \n\nanaemia, \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytope\n\nnia \n\ncoagulation \n\ndisorders, \n\naplastic \n\nanaemia, \n\nhaemolytic \n\nanaemia, \n\nlymphadenop\n\nathy \n\n transient \n\nincrease in \n\nserum IgM \n\nlevels3 \n\nlate \n\nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\ninfusion-relate\n\nd reactions4, \n\nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \n\nsyndrome, \n\ncytokine \n\nrelease \n\nsyndrome4, \n\nserum \n\nsickness \n\ninfusion-relate\n\nd acute \n\nreversible \n\nthrombocytop\n\nenia4 \n\nMetabolism \n\nand nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia\n\n, weight \n\ndecrease, \n\nperipheral \n\noedema, face \n\noedema, \n\nincreased LDH, \n\nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \n\ndisorders \n\n  depression, \n\nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \n\nhypoaesthesia, \n\nagitation, \n\ninsomnia, \n\nvasodilatation, \n\ndizziness, \n\nanxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \n\nneuropathy, \n\nfacial nerve \n\npalsy5 \n\ncranial \n\nneuropathy, \n\nloss of other \n\nsenses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \n\ndisorder, \n\nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \n\nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \n\nlabyrinth \n\ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \n\npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \n\ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \n\ninfarction4 and 6, \n\narrhythmia, \n+atrial \n\nfibrillation, \n\ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \n\ndisorder \n\n+left \n\nventricular \n\nfailure, \n+supraventri-\n\ncular \n\ntachycardia, \n\n+ventricular \n\ntachycardia, \n\n+angina, \n\n+myocardial \n\nischaemia, \n\nbradycardia \n\nsevere cardiac \n\ndisorders4 and 6 \n\nheart failure4 \n\nand 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \n\ndisorders \n hypertension, \n\northostatic \n\nhypotension, \n\nhypotension \n\n  vasculitis \n\n(predominatel\n\ny cutaneous), \n\nleukocytoclast\n\nic vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n bronchospasm4, \n\nrespiratory \n\ndisease, chest \n\npain, dyspnoea, \n\nincreased \n\ncough,  \n\nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \n\nbronchiolitis \n\nobliterans, \n\nlung \n\ndisorder, \n\nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \n\nlung disease7 \nrespiratory \n\nfailure4 \n\nlung \n\ninfiltration \n\n\n\n17  \n\nGastrointesti\n\nnal disorders \n\nnausea vomiting , \n\ndiarrhoea, \n\nabdominal pain, \n\ndysphagia, \n\nstomatitis, \n\nconstipation, \n\ndyspepsia, \n\nanorexia, throat \n\nirritation \n\nabdominal \n\nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestin\n\nal perforation7 \n \n\nSkin and \n\nSubcutaneou\n\ns tissue \n\ndisorders \n\npruritus, \n\nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nurticaria, \n\nsweating, night \n\nsweats, +skin \n\ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \n\nskin reactions, \n\nStevens-\n\nJohnson \n\nsyndrome, \n\ntoxic \n\nepidermal \n\nnecrolysis \n\n(Lyell\u2019s \n\nsyndrome)7 \n\n \n\nMusculoskele\n\ntal, \n\nconnective \n\ntissue \n\ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \n\nmyalgia, \n\narthralgia, back \n\npain, neck pain, \n\npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \n\nurinary \n\ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministratio\n\nn site \n\nconditions \n\nfever, chills, \n\nasthenia, \n\nheadache \n\ntumour pain, \n\nflushing, \n\nmalaise, \n\ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, \n+multi-organ \n\nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site \n\npain \n\n   \n\nInvestigation\n\ns \n\ndecreased \n\nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \n\nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (\u2265 grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other \n\nsymptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, \n\nfatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, \n\ndyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related \n\nreactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional \n\nreactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \n\noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions \n\nsuch as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \n\n\n\n18  \n\nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \n\nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower \n\nor unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially \n\nwith subsequent infusions and is < 1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with \n\ndecreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n\n \n\nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in \n\nthe rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about \n\n4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, \n\nincluding grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up \n\nto 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of \n\ninfections reported over a 2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections \n\neither new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with \n\nrituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with \n\nchemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious \n\nviral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster \n\nVirus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\n(PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and \n\nretreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, have \n\nbeen reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 \n\nhepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs. 0% FC. \n\nProgression of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with pre-\n\nexisting Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority \n\nof patients were HIV positive. \n\n \n\nHaematologic adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \n\noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) \n\nneutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. \n\nDuring rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \n\nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \n\nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1%, grade 3/4) and was not different \n\nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with \n\nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \n\nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \n\npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \n\nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the \n\nhigher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not \n\nassociated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with \n\nchemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established \n\nthat in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil \n\ncount remaining below 1x109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late \n\nonset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with \n\nno previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with \n\nrituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of \n\nlate neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. \n\nIn the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm \n\ncompared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 \n\nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \n\nthe FC group. \n\n\n\n19  \n\n \n\nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \n\nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \n\nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least \n\nbaseline level within 4 months. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular adverse reactions \n\nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \n\npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n\n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \n\ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \n\nwas comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events were \n\nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \n\nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to < 1% on \n\nobservation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \n\ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \n\nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \n\nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \n\ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \n\ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \n\nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \n\nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \n\nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \n\nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n\n \n\nRespiratory system \n\nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. \n\n \n\nNeurologic disorders \n\nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \n\ncycles), four patients (2%) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \n\nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \n\nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \n\npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \n\nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \n\nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% \n\nFC). \n\n \n\nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \n\nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \n\ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \n\ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \n\nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, hypertension, \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \n\nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \n\nadministered with chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nIgG levels \n\nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \n\nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \n\ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \n\nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \n\nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \n\nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n\n\n\n20  \n\n2 years). \n\n \n\nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been \n\nobserved in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \n\nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \n\npatients are unknown. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \n\noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n\n \n\nPatient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years): \n\nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3/4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared \n\nto younger patients (< 65 years). \n\n \n\nBulky disease \n\nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \n\nwithout bulky disease (25.6% vs. 15.4%). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \n\ntwo groups. \n\n \n\nRe-treatment \n\nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \n\nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \n\nADRs). \n\n \n\nPatient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \n\nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \n\ncompared to younger patients (< 65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory \n\nCLL. \n\n \n\nExperience from paediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nA multicenter, open-label randomized study of Lymphome Malin B chemotherapy (LMB) with or \n\nwithout rituximab was conducted in paediatric patients (aged \u2265 6 months to < 18 years old) with \n\npreviously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL.  \n\n \n\nA total of 309 paediatric patients received rituximab and were included in the safety analysis \n\npopulation. Paediatric patients randomized to the LMB chemotherapy arm with rituximab, or enrolled \n\nin the single arm part of the study, were administered rituximab at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA and \n\nreceived a total of six IV infusions of rituximab (two during each of the two induction courses and one \n\nduring each of the two consolidation courses of the LMB scheme).  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in paediatric patients (aged \u2265 6 months to < 18 years old) with \n\npreviously untreated advanced stage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL was generally consistent in \n\ntype, nature and severity with the known safety profile in adult NHL and CLL patients.    Addition of \n\nrituximab to chemotherapy did result in an increased risk of some events including infections \n\n(including sepsis) compared to chemotherapy only.   \n\n \n\nExperience from rheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \n\n\n\n21  \n\nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \n\nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one \n\ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; \n\napproximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having \n\nreceived 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience \n\nreflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \n\nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \n\nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 4. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall \n\nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \n\ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during \n\nthe initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, \n\nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like \n\nreaction have been reported during post marketing experience. \n\n \nTable 4 Summary of adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during \n\npost-marketing surveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \n\nreceiving rituximab \nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery \n\nCommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nupper respiratory \n\ntract infection, \n\nurinary tract \n\ninfections \n\nbronchitis, sinusitis, \n\ngastroenteritis, tinea \n\nped\u00eds \n\n  PML, \n\nreactivation of \n\nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\n neutropenia1  late \n\nneutropenia2 \n\nserum \n\nsickness-like \n\nreaction \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n3infusion-related \n\nreactions \n\n(hypertension, \n\nnausea, rash, \n\npyrexia, pruritus, \n\nurticaria, throat \n\nirritation, hot \n\nflush, \n\nhypotension, \n\nrhinitis, rigors, \n\ntachycardia, \n\nfatigue, \n\noropharyngeal \n\npain, peripheral \n\noedema, erythma) \n\n 3infusion-related \n\nreactions \n\n(generalised \n\noedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\nwheezing, \n\nlaryngeal \n\noedema, \n\nangioneurotic \n\noedema, \n\ngeneralised \n\npruritis, \n\nanaphylaxis, \n\nanaphylactoid \n\nreaction) \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutritional \n\ndisorders \n\n hypercholesterolemia    \n\nPsychiatric \n\ndisorders \n\n depression, anxiety    \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \n\nmigraine, dizziness, \n\nsciatica \n\n   \n\n\n\n22  \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery \n\nCommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nCardiac disorders    angina \n\npectoris, atrial \n\nfibrillation, \n\nheart failure, \n\nmyocardial \n\ninfarction \n\natrial flutter \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\n dyspepsia, diarrhoea, \n\ngastro-oesophageal \n\nreflux, mouth \n\nulceration, upper \n\nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis \n\n(Lyell\u2019s \n\nsyndrome), \n\nStevens-\n\nJohnson \n\nsyndrome5 \n\nMusculo-skeletal \n\ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \n\nmusculoskeletal \n\npain, osteoarthritis, \n\nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \n\nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \n\nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

IRRs may occur as \n\na result of hypersensitivity and/or to the mechanism of action. \n4 Includes observations collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring. \n5 Includes fatal cases \n\n \n\nMultiple courses \n\nMultiple courses of treatment are associated with a similar ADR profile to that observed following \n\nfirst exposure. The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n\n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the \n\nfirst treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first \n\n6 months of treatment. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs (refer to Table \n\n4). Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with \n\n733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \n\nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than \n\n1% (17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no \n\ndeaths due to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading \n\nto withdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with \n\nintravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n\n \n\nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious \n\nIRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour \n\nintravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic \n\ntherapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent \n\nwith that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated \n\n\n\n23  \n\npatients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \n\nrespiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious \n\nor required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections \n\ndid not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory \n\ntract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence \n\nin the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. \n\n \n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported \n\nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid \n\narthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and \n\nvasculitis. \n\n \n\nIn patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma). \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients \n\nreceiving rituximab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular adverse reactions \n\nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \n\npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \n\nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n\n \n\nNeurologic events \n\nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \n\nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \n\ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \n\ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \n\nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, hypertension, \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were \n\ntransient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the \n\nadministration of rituximab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and \n\n0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia. \n\n \n\nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \n\nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \n\noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \n\npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \n\nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \n\nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \n\nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \n\npatients are unknown. \n\n \n\nExperience from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n\n \n\n\n\n24  \n\nAdult induction of remission (GPA/MPA Study 1) \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, 99 adult patients were treated for induction of remission of GPA and MPA \n\nwith rituximab (375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe ADRs listed in Table 5 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of \u2265 5% in the \n\nrituximab group and at a higher frequency than the comparator group. \n\n \n\nTable 5 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in \u2265 5% of adult patients \n\nreceiving rituximab in GPA/MPA Study 1, and at a higher frequency than \n\nthe comparator group, in the pivotal clinical study. \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class \nAdverse event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUrinary tract infection 7% \n\nBronchitis 5% \n\nHerpes zoster 5% \n\nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic  \n\nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness 10% \n\nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHypertension 12% \n\nFlushing 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \n\nDyspnoea 11% \n\nEpistaxis 11% \n\nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \n\ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \n\nDyspepsia 6% \n\nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \n\ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective  \n\ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \n\nArthralgia 15% \n\n\n\n25  \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class \nAdverse event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nBack pain 10% \n\nMuscle weakness 5% \n\nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \n\nPain in extremities 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and  \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \n\nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n\n \nAdult maintenance treatment (GPA/MPA Study 2) \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, a total of 57 adult patients with severe, active GPA and MPA were treated with \n\nrituximab for the maintenance of remission (see section 5.1). \n\n \nTable 6 Adverse drug reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of adult patients receiving rituximab \n\nin GPA/MPA Study 2, and at a higher frequency than the comparator group \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class \n\nAdverse drug reaction \n\nRituximab  \n\n(n=57) \n\nInfections and infestations   \n\nBronchitis 14% \n\nRhinitis 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n \n\nPyrexia 9% \n\nInfluenza-like illness 5% \n\nOedema peripheral 5% \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   \n\nDiarrhoea 7% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n \n\nDyspnoea 9% \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural \n\ncomplications \n \n\nInfusion-related reactions1 12% \n1 Details on infusion related reactions are provided in the description of selected adverse drug reactions \n\nsection. \n\n \nThe overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile for rituximab in \n\napproved autoimmune indications, including GPA and MPA. Overall, 4% of patients in the rituximab \n\narm experienced adverse events leading to discontinuation. Most adverse events in the rituximab arm \n\nwere mild or moderate in intensity. No patients in the rituximab arm had fatal adverse events. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported events considered as ADRs were infusion-related reactions and \n\ninfections.   \n\n \n\nLong-term follow-up (GPA/MPA Study 3) \n\nIn a long-term observational safety study, 97 GPA and MPA patients received treatment with \n\nrituximab (mean of 8 infusions [range 1-28]) for up to 4 years, according to their physician\u2019s standard \n\npractice and discretion. The overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety \n\nprofile of rituximab in RA and GPA and MPA and no new adverse drug reactions were reported. \n\n \n\n\n\n26  \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nAn open-label, single arm study was conducted in 25 paediatric patients with severe, active GPA or \n\nMPA. The overall study period consisted of a 6-month remission induction phase with a minimum 18-\n\nmonth follow-up, up to 4.5 years overall.  During the follow-up phase, rituximab was given at the \n\ndiscretion of the investigator (17 out of 25 patients received additional rituximab treatment).  \n\nConcomitant treatment with other immunosuppressive therapy was permitted (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nADRs were considered as adverse events that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 10%. These included: \n\ninfections (17 patients [68%] in the remission induction phase; 23 patients [92%] in the overall study \n\nperiod), IRRs (15 patients [60%] in the remission induction phase; 17 patients [68%] in the overall \n\nstudy period), and nausea (4 patients [16%] in the remission induction phase; 5 patients [20%] in the \n\noverall study period).    \n\n \n\nDuring the overall study period, the safety profile of rituximab was consistent with that reported \n\nduring the remission induction phase.  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in paediatric GPA or MPA patients was consistent in type, nature and \n\nseverity with the known safety profile in adult patients in the approved autoimmune indications, \n\nincluding adult GPA or MPA.    \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1 (adult induction of remission study), IRRs were defined as any adverse event \n\noccurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in \n\nthe safety population. Of the 99 patients treated with rituximab, 12 (12%) experienced at least one \n\nIRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release \n\nsyndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in combination with \n\nintravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. \n\n \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 2 (adult maintenance study), 7/57 (12%) patients in the rituximab arm \n\nexperienced at least one infusion-related reaction. The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest \n\nduring or after the first infusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (< 4%).  \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the clinical trial in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA, the reported IRRs were predominantly seen \n\nwith the first infusion (8 patients [32%]), and then decreased over time with the number of rituximab \n\ninfusions (20% with the second infusion, 12% with the third infusion and 8% with the fourth infusion).  \n\nThe most common IRR symptoms reported during the remission induction phase were: headache, rash, \n\nrhinorrhea and pyrexia (8%, for each symptom).  The observed symptoms of IRRs were similar to those \n\nknown in adult GPA or MPA patients treated with rituximab.  The majority of IRRs were Grade 1 and \n\nGrade 2, there were two non-serious Grade 3 IRRs, and no Grade 4 or 5 IRRs reported.  One serious \n\nGrade 2 IRR (generalized oedema which resolved with treatment) was reported in one patient (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years \n\n(95% CI 197-285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate \n\nand consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. \n\nThe rate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently \n\nreported serious infection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n\n \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, 30/57 (53%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced infections. The \n\nincidence of all grade infections was similar between the arms. Infections were predominately mild \n\nto moderate. The most common infections in the rituximab arm included upper respiratory tract \n\ninfections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. The incidence of serious \n\ninfections was similar in both arms (approximately 12%). The most commonly reported serious \n\n\n\n27  \n\ninfection in the rituximab group was mild or moderate bronchitis. \n\n \n\nIn the clinical trial in paediatric patients with severe, active GPA and MPA, 91% of reported infections \n\nwere non-serious and 90% were mild to moderate.  \n\nThe most common infections in the overall phase were: upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) \n\n(48%), influenza (24%), conjunctivitis (20%), nasopharyngitis (20%), lower respiratory tract \n\ninfections (16%), sinusitis (16%), viral URTIs (16%), ear infection (12%), gastroenteritis (12%), \n\npharyngitis (12%), urinary tract infection (12%).  Serious infections were reported in 7 patients (28%), \n\nand included: influenza (2 patients [8%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (2 patients [8%]) as the \n\nmost frequently reported events. \n\n \n\nMalignancies \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, the incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients in the GPA and MPA \n\nclinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient \n\nhad completed the follow-up period). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of \n\nmalignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated \n\nvasculitis. \n\n \n\nIn the paediatric clinical trial, no malignancies were reported with a follow-up period of up to 54 \n\nmonths. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular adverse reactions \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years \n\n(95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per \n\n100 patient years (95% CI 3-15). The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and \n\natrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNeurologic events \n\nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \n\nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \n\nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \n\nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \n\nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, \n\nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\nA small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \n\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the post-\n\nmarketing setting. \n\n \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \n\nadult and peadiatric GPA and MPA patients treated with rituximab.  \n\n \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, at 6 months, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with \n\nnormal immunoglobulin levels at baseline had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively, compared \n\nto 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group. The rate of overall infections and serious \n\ninfections was not increased after the development of low IgA, IgG or IgM. \n\n \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, no clinically meaningful differences between the two treatment arms or \n\ndecreases in total immunoglobulin, IgG, IgM or IgA levels were observed throughout the trial. \n\n \n\nIn the paediatric clinical trial, during the overall study period, 3/25 (12%) patients reported an event of \n\nhypogammaglobulinaemia, 18 patients (72%) had prolonged (defined as Ig levels below lower limit of \n\nnormal for at least 4 months) low IgG levels (of whom 15 patients also had prolonged low IgM).  \n\nThree patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IV-IG).  Based on limited data, \n\n\n\n28  \n\nno firm conclusions can be drawn regarding whether prolonged low IgG and IgM led to an increased \n\nrisk of serious infection in these patients. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \n\npatients are unknown. \n\nNeutropenia \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 1, 24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and 23% of patients in \n\nthe cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not \n\nassociated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated patients.  \n\n \n\nIn GPA/MPA Study 2, the incidence of all-grade neutropenia was 0% for rituximab-treated patients \n\nvs. 5% for azathioprine treated patients. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \n\noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n\n \n\nExperience from pemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile in PV Study 1 (Study ML22196) and PV Study 2 (Study WA29330) \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoids in the \n\ntreatment of patients with pemphigus vulgaris was studied in a Phase 3, randomised, controlled, \n\nmulticenter, open-label study in pemphigus patients that included 38 pemphigus vulgaris (PV) \n\npatients randomised to the rituximab group (PV Study 1). Patients randomised to the rituximab group \n\nreceived an initial 1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15. \n\nMaintenance doses of 500 mg IV were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients could receive \n\n1000 mg IV at the time of relapse (see section 5.1).   \n\n \n\nIn PV Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, multicenter study \n\nevaluating the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in \n\npatients with moderate-to-severe PV requiring oral corticosteroids, 67 PV patients received treatment \n\nwith rituximab (initial 1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15 \n\nrepeated at Weeks 24 and 26) for up to 52 weeks (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in PV was consistent with the established safety profile in other \n\napproved autoimmune indications.   \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions for PV Studies 1 and 2 \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions from PV Studies 1 and 2 are presented in Table 7. In PV Study 1, ADRs were \n\ndefined as adverse events which occurred at a rate of \u2265 5% among rituximab-treated PV patients, with \n\na \u2265 2% absolute difference in incidence between the rituximab-treated group and the standard-dose \n\nprednisone group up to month 24. No patients were withdrawn due to ADRs in Study 1. In PV Study \n\n2, ADRs were defined as adverse events occurring in \u22655% of patients in the rituximab arm and \n\nassessed as related. \n\n \n\nTable 7 Adverse drugs reactions in rituximab-treated pemphigus vulgaris patients in \n\nPV Study 1 (up to Month 24) and PV Study 2 (up to Week 52) \n\n \nMedDRA System Organ Class Very Common Common \n\nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infection Herpes virus infection \n\nHerpes zoster \n\nOral herpes \n\nConjunctivitis \n\nNasopharyngitis \n\nOral candidiasis \n\nUrinary tract infection \n\n\n\n29  \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Very Common Common \n\nNeoplasms Benign, Malignant and \n\nUnspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \n\n Skin papilloma \n\nPsychiatric disorders Persistent depressive disorder Major depression \n\nIrritability \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n\n \n\nDizziness \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Abdominal pain upper \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Alopecia Pruritus \n\nUrticaria \n\nSkin disorder \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and \n\nbone disorders \n\n Musculoskeletal pain \n\nArthralgia \n\nBack pain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\n Fatigue \n\nAsthenia \n\nPyrexia \n\nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural \n\nComplications \n\nInfusion-related reactions*  \n\n*Infusion-related reactions for PV Study 1 included symptoms collected on the next scheduled visit after each infusion, \n\nand adverse events occurring on the day of or one day after the infusion.  The most common infusion-related reaction \n\nsymptoms/Preferred Terms for PV Study 1 included headaches, chills, high blood pressure, nausea, asthenia and pain. \n\n \n\nThe most common infusion-related reaction symptoms/Preferred Terms for PV Study 2 were dyspnoea, erythema, \n\nhyperhidrosis, flushing/hot flush, hypotension/low blood pressure and rash/rash pruritic. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\nIn PV Study 1, infusion-related reactions were common (58%). Nearly all infusion-related reactions \n\nwere mild to moderate. The proportion of patients experiencing an infusion-related reaction was 29% \n\n(11 patients), 40% (15 patients), 13% (5 patients), and 10% (4 patients) following the first, second, \n\nthird, and fourth infusions, respectively. No patients were withdrawn from treatment due to infusion-\n\nrelated reactions. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions were similar in type and severity to those \n\nseen in RA and GPA/MPA patients. \n\n \n\nIn PV Study 2, IRRs occurred primarily at the first infusion and the frequency of IRRs decreased with \n\nsubsequent infusions: 17.9%, 4.5%, 3% and 3% of patients experienced IRRs at the first, second, third, \n\nand fourth infusions, respectively.  In 11/15 patients who experienced at least one IRR, the IRRs were \n\nGrade 1 or 2.  In 4/15 patients, Grade \u22653 IRRs were reported and led to discontinuation of rituximab \n\ntreatment; three of the four patients experienced serious (life-threatening) IRRs.  Serious IRRs \n\noccurred at the first (2 patients) or second (1 patient) infusion and resolved with symptomatic \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn PV Study 1, 14 patients (37%) in the rituximab group experienced treatment-related infections \n\ncompared to 15 patients (42%) in the standard-dose prednisone group. The most common infections \n\nin the rituximab group were herpes simplex and zoster infections, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, \n\nfungal infection and conjunctivitis. Three patients (8%) in the rituximab group experienced a total of \n\n5 serious infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, infective thrombosis, intervertebral discitis, \n\nlung infection, Staphylococcal sepsis) and one patient (3%) in the standard-dose prednisone group \n\nexperienced a serious infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). \n\n \n\nIn PV Study 2, 42 patients (62.7%) in the rituximab arm experienced infections.  The most common \n\ninfections in the rituximab group were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, oral \n\n\n\n30  \n\ncandidiasis and urinary tract infection.  Six patients (9%) in the rituximab arm experienced serious \n\ninfections. \n\n \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \n\nPV Study 2, in the rituximab arm, transient decreases in lymphocyte count, driven by decreases in the \n\nperipheral T-cell populations, as well as a transient decrease in phosphorus level were very commonly \n\nobserved post-infusion. These were considered to be induced by IV methylprednisolone premedication \n\ninfusion. \n\n \n\nIn PV Study 2, low IgG levels were commonly observed and low IgM levels were very commonly \n\nobserved; however, there was no evidence of an increased risk of serious infections after the \n\ndevelopment of low IgG or IgM. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation \n\nis available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in \n\nhumans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No \n\nadditional safety signals were identified. \n\n \n\nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had \n\nno reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with \n\na dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC02.  \n\n \n\nBlitzima is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n\nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \n\nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on > 95% of \n\nall B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. \n\n \n\nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \n\npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize \n\nupon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the \n\nplasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n\n \n\nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \n\nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \n\ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \n\nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fc\u03b3 receptors on \n\n\n\n31  \n\nthe surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B \n\nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n\n \n\nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. \n\nIn patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of \n\ntreatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, \n\nalthough in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months \n\npost-induction therapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the \n\nperipheral blood was observed following two infusions of 1000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day \n\ninterval. Peripheral blood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation \n\nis observed in the majority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was administered as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged \n\nperipheral B cell depletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with \n\nGPA or MPA, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to < 10 cells/\u03bcL after two weekly \n\ninfusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month time \n\npoint. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts > 10 cells/\u03bcL by \n\nmonth 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n\n \n\nClinical experience in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nFollicular lymphoma \n\n \n\nMonotherapy \n\nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \n\nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \n\nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \n\nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48% (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \n\ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \n\nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \n\nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \n\nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n\n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \n\nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \n\nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. \n\nNeither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence nor absence of bulky disease, normal \n\nor high LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher\u2019s exact \n\ntest) on response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response \n\nrates and bone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded \n\ncompared to 59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not \n\nsupported by a stepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as \n\nprognostic factors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and \n\nbulky disease. \n\n \n\nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \n\nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \n\nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \n\nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% \u2013 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \n\nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n\n \n\nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \n\nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \n\nlesion \u2265 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \n\nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36% (CI95% 21% \u2013 51%; CR 3%, PR \n\n33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n\n \n\nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \n\nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \n\n\n\n32  \n\nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \n\nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \n\npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course \n\nin the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the \n\nORR was 38% (CI95% 26% \u2013 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding \n\npatients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 \u2013 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after \n\nthe prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). \n\n \n\nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n\nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \n\nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \n\nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on \n\ndays 1-5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). \n\nRituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 \n\nR-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow-up of \n\npatients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, \n\ntime to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of \n\npatients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< 0.0001 Chi-Square \n\ntest) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP \n\nsignificantly prolonged the time to disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months \n\nand 14.7 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was \n\n37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank \n\ntest). \n\n \n\nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \n\nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were \n\n80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1% for patients in the CVP group\uff0e \n\n \n\nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy \n\nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-\u03b1) have also demonstrated significant \n\nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1078 patients \n\nresponded to induction therapy, of which 1018 were randomised to rituximab maintenance therapy \n\n(n=505) or observation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to \n\nbaseline characteristics and disease status. Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single \n\ninfusion of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease \n\nprogression or for a maximum period of two years. \n\n \n\nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months \n\nfrom randomisation, maintenance therapy with rituximab resulted in a clinically relevant and \n\nstatistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-\n\nfree survival (PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular \n\nlymphoma (Table 9). \n\n \n\nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with rituximab was also seen for the secondary \n\nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \n\nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 9).  \n\n \n\nData from extended follow-up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the \n\nlong-term benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT and TNCT (Table \n\n9). \n\n \nTable 9 Overview of efficacy results for rituximab maintenance vs. observation at the \n\nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \n\nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis \n\n(median FU: 25 months) \n\nFinal analysis \n\n(median FU: 9.0 years) \n\nObservation \n\nN=513 \n\nRituximab \n\nN=505 \n\nObservation \n\nN=513 \n\nRituximab \n\nN=505 \n\nPrimary efficacy     \n\nProgression-free survival (median) NR NR 4.06 years 10.49 years \n\nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\nhazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nrisk reduction \n\n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n\n50% \n\n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n\n39% \n\nSecondary efficacy     \n\nOverall survival (median) NR NR NR NR \n\nlog-rank p value 0.7246 0.7948 \n\nhazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nrisk reduction \n\n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n\n11% \n\n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n\n-6% \n\nEvent-free survival (median) 38 months NR 4.04 years 9.25 years \n\nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\nhazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nrisk reduction  \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n\n46% \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n\n36% \n\nTNLT (median) NR NR 6.11 years NR \n\nlog-rank p value 0.0003 <0.0001 \n\nhazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nrisk reduction  \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n\n39% \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n\n34% \n\nTNCT (median) NR NR 9.32 years NR \n\nlog-rank p value 0.0011 0.0004 \n\n\n\n34  \n\nhazard ratio (95% CI) \n\nrisk reduction  \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n\n40% \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n\n39% \n\nOverall response rate* 55% 74% 61% 79% \n\nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.33 (1.73, 3.15) 2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \n\nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate* 48% 67% 53% 67% \n\nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.21 (1.65, 2.94) 2.34 (1.80, 3.03)  \n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.  \n\nCI: confidence interval; FU: follow-up; OS: overall survival; TNLT: time to next anti-lymphoma treatment; \n\nTNCT: time to next chemotherapy treatment; NR: not reached at time of clinical cut-off. \n\n \n\nRituximab maintenance treatment provided consistent benefit in all predefined subgroups tested: \n\ngender (male, female), age (< 60 years, \u2265 60 years), FLIPI score (\u22641, 2 or \u2265 3), induction therapy (R-\n\nCHOP, R-CVP or R-FCM) and regardless of the quality of response to induction treatment (CR, \n\nCRu or PR).

The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to \n\nbaseline characteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial \n\nremission following induction therapy were randomised in a second step to rituximab maintenance \n\ntherapy (n=167) or observation (n=167).

The median PFS was 42.2 months in the rituximab maintenance \n\narm compared to 14.3 months in the observation arm.

Rituximab maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients \n\nresponding to CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p< 0.0001) as \n\nwell as in those responding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, \n\np=0.0071). Although subgroups were small, rituximab maintenance treatment provided a significant \n\nbenefit in terms of overall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to \n\nR-CHOP, although longer follow-up is required to confirm this observation. \n\n \n\nAdult Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 \n\nyears) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy \n\n(cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 \n\nmg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or \n\nrituximab 375 mg/m2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of the \n\ntreatment cycle. \n\n \n\nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \n\nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well \n\nbalanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-\n\nCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in \n\nthe duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse \n\nor progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p=0.0001). Kaplan \n\nMeier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm \n\ncompared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41%. At 24 months, \n\nestimates for overall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4% in the CHOP arm. \n\n\n\n36  \n\nA subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up \n\nduration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), \n\nrepresenting a risk reduction of 32%. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \n\nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \n\ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group and 62.4% in the CHOP group \n\n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by 51%. In all \n\npatient subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, \u03b22 microglobulin, LDH, \n\nalbumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for \n\nevent-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and \n\n0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk \n\npatients according to age adjusted IPI. \n\n \n\nClinical laboratory findings \n\nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n\n356 patients evaluated for anti-drug antibody (ADA), 1.1% (4 patients) were positive. \n\n \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients \n\nwith relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 \n\nmg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in \n\ncombination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first \n\ncycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent \n\ntreatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had \n\npreviously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to \n\nachieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total \n\nof 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 12a and Table 12b) and 552 \n\npatients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 13) were analysed for efficacy. \n\n \n\nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 \n\nmonths in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of \n\noverall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone \n\n(p=0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 12a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most \n\npatient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 12b). \n\n \n\nTable 12a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \n\nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy Parameter Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Median \n\nTime to Event (months) \n\nRisk \n\nReduction \n\nFC \n\n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n\n(N=408) \n\nLog-rank \n\np value \n\nProgression\u2010free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \n\nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \n\nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \n\nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \n\nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n\n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n\n36.0% \n\n<0.0001 \n\n<0.0001 \n\nN/A \n\nN/A \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \n\nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \n\nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

These studies support the use of rituximab with any chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nData in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with rituximab have demonstrated clinical \n\nbenefit (including CR) and are supportive for rituximab re-treatment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA multicenter, open-label, randomized study of Lymphome Malin B (LMB) chemotherapy \n\n(corticosteroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, doxorubicin, \n\n\n\n38  \n\netoposide and triple drug [methotrexate/cytarabine/ corticosteroid] intrathecal therapy) alone or in \n\ncombination with rituximab was conducted in paediatric patients with previously untreated advanced \n\nstage CD20 positive DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL. Advanced stage is defined as Stage III with elevated \n\nLDH level (\u201cB-high\u201d), [LDH > twice the institutional upper limit of the adult normal values (> Nx2)] \n\nor any stage IV or BAL. Patients were randomized to receive either LMB chemotherapy or six IV \n\ninfusions of rituximab at a dose of 375mg/m2 BSA in combination with LMB chemotherapy (two \n\nduring each of the two induction courses and one during each of the two consolidation courses) as per \n\nthe LMB scheme. A total of 328 randomized patients were included in the efficacy analyses, of which \n\none patient under 3 years of age received rituximab in combination with LMB chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThe two treatment arms, LMB (LMB chemotherapy) and R-LMB (LMB chemotherapy with \n\nrituximab), were well balanced with regards to baseline characteristics. Patients had a median age of 7 \n\nand 8 years in the LMB arm and R-LMB arm, respectively. Approximately half of patients were in \n\nGroup B (50.6% in the LMB arm and 49.4% in the R-LMB arm), 39.6% in Group C1 in both arms, \n\nand 9.8% and 11.0% were in Group C3 in the LMB and R-LMB arms, respectively. Based on Murphy \n\nstaging, most patients were either BL stage III (45.7% in the LMB arm and 43.3% in the R-LMB arm) \n\nor BAL, CNS negative (21.3% in the LMB arm and 24.4% in the R-LMB arm). Less than half of the \n\npatients (45.1% in both arms) had bone marrow involvement, and most patients (72.6% in the LMB \n\narm and 73.2% in the R-LMB arm) had no CNS involvement. The primary efficacy endpoint was \n\nEFS, where an event was defined as occurrence of progressive disease, relapse, second malignancy, \n\ndeath from any cause, or non-response as evidenced by detection of viable cells in residue after the \n\nsecond CYVE course, whichever occurs first. The secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and CR \n\n(complete remission).  \n\n \n\nAt the pre-specified interim analysis with approximately 1 year of median follow-up, clinically \n\nrelevant improvement in the primary endpoint of EFS was observed, with 1-year rate estimates of \n\n94.2% (95% CI, 88.5% - 97.2%) in the R-LMB arm vs. 81.5% (95% CI, 73.0% - 87.8%) in the LMB \n\narm, and adjusted Cox HR 0.33 (95% CI, 0.14 \u2013 0.79). Upon IDMC (independent data monitoring \n\ncommittee) recommendation based on this result, the randomization was halted and patients in the \n\nLMB arm were allowed to cross over to receive rituximab.   \n\n \n\nPrimary efficacy analyses were performed in 328 randomized patients with a median follow-up of 3.1 \n\nyears.

While no major differences in \n\nnumbers of patients achieving CR was observed between the two treatment groups, the benefit of \n\nrituximab addition to LMB chemotherapy was also shown in the secondary endpoint of OS, with the \n\nOS HR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.16 \u2013 0.81). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with follicular lymphoma and chronic \n\nlymphocytic leukaemia, and in the paediatric population from birth to < 6 months of age in CD20 \n\npositive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\nClinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of rituximab in alleviating the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis in \n\npatients with an inadequate response to TNF-inhibitors was demonstrated in a pivotal randomised, \n\ncontrolled, double-blind, multicentre trial (Trial 1). \n\n \n\nTrial 1 evaluated 517 patients that had experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to one or \n\nmore TNF inhibitor therapies. Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed according \n\nto the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Rituximab was administered as two \n\nIV infusions separated by an interval of 15 days. Patients received 2 x 1000 mg intravenous infusions \n\nof rituximab or placebo in combination with MTX. All patients received concomitant 60 mg oral \n\nprednisone on days 2-7 and 30 mg on days 8-14 following the first infusion. The primary endpoint \n\nwas the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Patients were followed \n\nbeyond week 24 for long-term endpoints, including radiographic assessment at 56 weeks and at 104 \n\nweeks. During this time, 81% of patients, from the original placebo group received rituximab \n\nbetween weeks 24 and 56, under an open label extension study protocol. \n\n \n\nTrials of rituximab in patients with early arthritis (patients without prior methotrexate treatment and \n\npatients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, but not yet treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors) \n\nhave met their primary endpoints. Rituximab is not indicated for these patients, since the safety data \n\nabout long-term rituximab treatment are insufficient, in particular concerning the risk of \n\ndevelopment of malignancies and PML. \n\n \n\nDisease activity outcomes \n\nRituximab in combination with methotrexate significantly increased the proportion of patients \n\nachieving at least a 20% improvement in ACR score compared with patients treated with \n\nmethotrexate alone (Table 15). Across all development studies the treatment benefit was similar in \n\npatients independent of age, gender, body surface area, race, number of prior treatments or disease \n\nstatus. \n\n \n\nClinically and statistically significant improvement was also noted on all individual components of \n\nthe ACR response (tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessment, \n\ndisability index scores (HAQ), pain assessment and C-Reactive Proteins (mg/dL). \n\n \n\nTable 15 Clinical response outcomes at primary endpoint in Trial 1 (ITT population) \n\n \n\n Outcome\u2020 Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n\n(2 x 1000 mg) \n\nTrial 1  N= 201 N= 298 \n\n ACR20 36 (18%) 153 (51%)\n***\n\n \n\nACR50 11 (5%) 80 (27%)\n***\n\n \n\nACR70 3 (1%) 37 (12%)\n***\n\n \n\n\n\n40  \n\n EULAR Response \n\n(Good/Moderate) \n44 (22%) 193 (65%)\n\n***\n \n\n Mean change in DAS \u20100.34 \u20101.83\n***\n\n \n\n\u2020 Outcome at 24 weeks \n\nSignificant difference from placebo + MTX at the primary time point: ***p \u2264 0.0001 \n\n \n\nPatients treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate had a significantly greater \n\nreduction in disease activity score (DAS28) than patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 15). \n\nSimilarly, a good to moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was \n\nachieved by significantly more rituximab treated patients treated with rituximab and methotrexate \n\ncompared to patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 15). \n\n \n\nRadiographic response \n\nStructural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \n\nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \n\nscore. \n\n \n\nIn Trial 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF \n\ninhibitor therapies, receiving rituximab in combination with methotrexate demonstrated \n\nsignificantly less radiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at \n\n56 weeks.

All patients in the \n\ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both \n\narms received 1000 mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \n\nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 \n\nmg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment. \n\n \n\nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \n\nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \n\nglucocorticoid therapy. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was \n\n20%. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete \n\nremission (CR) at 6 months (Table 19). \n\n \n\nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \n\ndisease (Table 20). \n\n \n\nTable 19 Percentage of adult patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n\n(Intent-to-treat population*) \n\n \nRituximab \n\n(n = 99) \nCyclophosphamide \n\n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment difference \n\n(Rituximab -\n\ncyclophosphamide) \n\nRate 63.6% 53.1% \n\n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n\n(\u22123.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n\u2013 CI = confidence interval. \n\n\u2013 * Worst case imputation \na  Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (\u22123.2%) was higher than the pre-determined  \n\nnon-inferiority margin (\u2212 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \n\nTable 20 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n\n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \n\nAll patients \n\nNewly diagnosed \n\nRelapsing \n\nn=99 \n\nn=48 \n\nn=51 \n\nn=98 \n\nn=48 \n\nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \n\nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (\u20103.2, 24.3) \n\nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% \u2212 4.2% (\u2212 23.6, 15.3) \n\nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n\n \n\n\n\n44  \n\n \n\nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \n\nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved \n\nCR at 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for \n\nmaintenance of complete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of \n\npatients achieved CR at 18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the \n\nrituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n\n \n\nLaboratory evaluations \n\nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients from the induction of remission trial tested positive \n\nfor ADA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were ADA positive at screening. \n\nThere was no apparent trend or negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy in the \n\ninduction of the remission trial. \n\n \n\nAdult maintenance treatment  \n\n \n\nA total of 117 patients (88 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated \n\nvasculitis) in disease remission were randomised to receive azathioprine (59 patients) or rituximab (58 \n\npatients) in a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open-label study. Included patients were 21 to 75 \n\nyears of age and had newly diagnosed or relapsing disease in complete remission after combined \n\ntreatment with glucocorticoids and pulse cyclophosphamide. The majority of patients were ANCA-\n\npositive at diagnosis or during the course of their disease; had histologically confirmed necrotizing \n\nsmall-vessel vasculitis with a clinical phenotype of GPA or MPA, or renal limited ANCA-associated \n\nvasculitis; or both. \n\nRemission-induction therapy included IV prednisone, administered as per the investigator\u2019s discretion, \n\npreceded in some patients by methylprednisolone pulses, and pulse cyclophosphamide until remission \n\nwas attained after 4 to 6 months. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last \n\ncyclophosphamide pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab (two 500 mg IV \n\ninfusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by 500 mg IV every 6 months for 18 \n\nmonths) or azathioprine (administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then \n\n1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after these \n\n22 months)). Prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg per \n\nday) for at least 18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop \n\nprednisone treatment after month 18 were left at the investigator\u2019s discretion.  \n\nAll patients were followed until month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last rituximab infusion \n\nor azathioprine dose). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was required for all patients with \n\nCD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 250 per cubic millimeter. \n\nThe primary outcome measure was the rate of major relapse at month 28.  \n\nResults \n\nAt month 28, major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of \n\nvasculitis activity ([BVAS] > 0) that could lead to organ failure or damage or could be life \n\nthreatening) occurred in 3 patients (5%) in the rituximab group and 17 patients (29%) in the \n\nazathioprine group (p=0.0007). Minor relapses (not life threatening and not involving major organ \n\ndamage) occurred in seven patients in the rituximab group (12%) and eight patients in the azathioprine \n\ngroup (14%).  \n\nThe cumulative incidence rate curves showed that time to first major relapse was longer in patients \n\nwith rituximab starting from month 2 and was maintained up to month 28 (Figure 3). \n\n\n\n45  \n\nFigure 3:  Cumulative incidence over time of first major relapse \n\n      \n\n \n\n \nNumber of Subjects with Major Relapse \n\nAzathioprine 0 0 3 3 5 5 8 8 9 9 9 10 13 15 17 \n\nRituximab 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \n\nAzathioprine 59 56 52 50 47 47 44 44 42 41 40 39 36 34 0 \n\nRituximab 58 56 56 56 55 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 52 50 0 \n\nNote: Patients were censored at month 28 if they had no event.    \n\n \n\nLaboratory evaluations \n\nA total of 6/34 (18%) of rituximab treated patients from the maintenance therapy clinical trial \n\ndeveloped ADA.

The median age of \n\npatients in the study was: 14 years (range: 6-17 years) and the majority of patients (20/25 [80%]) were \n\nfemale.  A total of 19 patients (76%) had GPA and 6 patients (24%) had MPA at baseline.  Eighteen \n\npatients (72%) had newly diagnosed disease upon study entry (13 patients with GPA and 5 patients \n\nwith MPA) and 7 patients had relapsing disease (6 patients with GPA and 1 patient with MPA). \n\n \n\nThe study design consisted of an initial 6-month remission induction phase, with a minimum 18-\n\nmonth follow-up, up to a maximum of 54 months (4.5 years) overall.  Patients were to receive a \n\nminimum of 3 doses of IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 1 g/day) prior to the first \n\nrituximab IV infusion. If clinically indicated, additional daily doses (up to three), of IV \n\nmethylprednisolone could be given. The remission induction regimen consisted of four once weekly \n\nIV infusions of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 BSA, on study days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in combination \n\nwith oral prednisolone or prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day \n\nminimum (max 10 mg/day) by Month 6.  After the remission induction phase, patients could, at the \n\ndiscretion of the investigator, receive subsequent rituximab infusions on or after Month 6 to maintain \n\nPVAS remission and control disease activity (including progressive disease or flare) or to achieve first \n\nremission. \n\nSurvival Time (Months) \n\nP\ner\n\nce\nn\n\nta\nge\n\n o\nf \n\nP\nat\n\nie\nn\n\nts\n w\n\nit\nh\n\n F\nir\n\nst\n \n\nM\naj\n\no\nr \n\nR\nel\n\nap\nse\n\n \n\n\n\n46  \n\n \n\nAll 25 patients completed all four once weekly IV infusions for the 6-month remission induction \n\nphase.

In the PV population, 5 (13%) patients in the rituximab group and 3 (8%) \n\npatients in the standard prednisone group had moderate disease and 33 (87%) patients in the rituximab \n\ngroup and 33 (92%) patients in the standard-dose prednisone group had severe disease according to \n\ndisease severity defined by Harman\u2019s criteria. \n\n \n\nPatients were stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) and randomised 1:1 to \n\nreceive either rituximab and low-dose prednisone or standard-dose prednisone. Patients randomised to \n\nthe rituximab group received an initial intravenous infusion of 1000 mg rituximab on Study Day 1 in \n\ncombination with 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 3 months if they had moderate \n\ndisease or 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 6 months if they had severe disease, and a \n\nsecond intravenous infusion of 1000 mg on Study Day 15. Maintenance infusions of rituximab 500 mg \n\nwere administered at months 12 and 18. Patients randomised to the standard-dose prednisone group \n\nreceived an initial 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 12 months if they had moderate \n\ndisease or 1.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 18 months if they had severe disease.  \n\nPatients in the rituximab group who relapsed could receive an additional infusion of rituximab \n\n1000 mg in combination with reintroduced or escalated prednisone dose. Maintenance and relapse \n\ninfusions were administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion.  \n\n \n\nThe primary objective for the study was complete remission (complete epithelialisation and absence of \n\nnew and/or established lesions) at month 24 without the use of prednisone therapy for two months or \n\nmore (CRoff for \uf0b32 months).  \n\n \n\nPV Study 1 Results \n\nThe study showed statistically significant results of rituximab and low-dose prednisone over standard-\n\ndose prednisone in achieving CRoff \uf0b3 2 months at month 24 in PV patients (see Table 22).   \n\nTable 22  Percentage of PV patients who achieved complete remission off corticosteroid \n\ntherapy for two months or more at month 24 (Intent-to-Treat Population - PV) \n\n Rituximab + \n\nPrednisone \n\nN=38 \n\nPrednisone \n\nN=36 \n\n \n\np-value a 95% CI b \n\nNumber of responders      \n\n(response rate [%]) \n\n34 (89.5%) 10 (27.8%) <0.0001 61.7% (38.4, 76.5) \n\na p-value is from Fisher\u2019s exact test with mid-p correction \nb 95% confidence interval is corrected Newcombe interval   \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of rituximab plus low-dose prednisone patients off prednisone therapy or on minimal \n\ntherapy (prednisone dose of 10 mg or less per day) compared to standard-dose prednisone patients \n\nover the 24-month treatment period shows a steroid-sparing effect of rituximab (Figure 4).  \n\n\n\n48  \n\nFigure 4:  Number of patients who were off or on minimal corticosteroid (\u226410 mg/day) therapy \n\nover time \n\n \n\nPost-hoc retrospective laboratory evaluation \n\nA total of 19/34 (56%) patients with PV, who were treated with rituximab, tested positive for ADA \n\nantibodies by 18 months.

Patients had a confirmed \n\ndiagnosis of PV within the previous 24 months and evidence of moderate-to-severe disease (defined as \n\na total Pemphigus Disease Area Index, PDAI, activity score of \uf0b3 15).   \nOne hundred and thirty-five patients were randomized to treatment with rituximab 1000 mg \n\nadministered on Day 1, Day 15, Week 24 and Week 26 or oral MMF 2 g/day for 52 weeks in \n\ncombination with 60 or 80 mg oral prednisone with the aim of tapering to 0 mg/day prednisone by \n\nWeek 24.   \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy objective for this study was to evaluate at week 52, the efficacy of rituximab \n\ncompared with MMF in achieving sustained complete remission defined as achieving healing of \n\nlesions with no new active lesions (i.e., PDAI activity score of 0) while on 0 mg/day prednisone or \n\nequivalent, and maintaining this response for at least 16 consecutive weeks, during the 52-week \n\ntreatment period.  \n\n \nPV Study 2 Results \n\nThe study demonstrated the superiority of rituximab over MMF in combination with a tapering course \n\nof oral corticosteroids in achieving CR off corticosteroid \uf0b3 16 weeks at Week 52 in PV patients (Table \n\n23).The majority of patients in the mITT population were newly diagnosed (74%) and 26% of patients \n\nhad established disease (duration of illness \uf0b3 6 months and received prior treatment for PV).  \n\n \n\n\n\n49  \n\nTable 23  Percentage of PV Patients Who Achieved Sustained Complete Remission Off \n\nCorticosteroid Therapy for 16 Weeks or More at Week 52 (Modified Intent-to-Treat \n\nPopulation) \n Rituximab \n\n(N=62) \n\nMMF \n\n(N=63) \n\nDifference (95% CI) p-value \n\nNumber of responders (response \n\nrate [%]) \n\n \n\nNewly diagnosed patients \n\n \n\nPatients with established disease \n\n \n\n25 (40.3%) \n\n \n\n19 (39.6%)  \n\n \n\n6 (42.9%) \n\n6 (9.5%) \n\n \n\n4 (9.1%)  \n\n \n\n2 (10.5%) \n\n30.80% (14.70%, 45.15%) <0.0001 \n\nMMF = Mycophenolate mofetil.

There was no apparent negative impact of the presence \n\nof ADA on safety or efficacy in PV Study 2. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAdult Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\n \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or \n\nmultiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied \n\nrituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific \n\nclearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and \n\ncentral compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, \n\nrespectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, \n\n6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions \n\ncontributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 \n\nmg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4 weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts \n\nor tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual variability \n\nremained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied \n\nby body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) \n\ncontributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were \n\nrelatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nrituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates \n\nis not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n\n \n\n\n\n50  \n\nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \n\ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \n\ninfusion of 486 \u00b5g/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 \u00b5g/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \n\npatients 3 \u2013 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n\n \n\nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \n\nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive \n\ninfusion, spanning from a mean of 243 \u00b5g/mL (range, 16 \u2013 582 \u00b5g/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \n\n\u00b5g/mL (range, 171 \u2013 1177 \u00b5g/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \n\ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n\n \n\nPaediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL  \n\n \n\nIn the clinical trial studying paediatric DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL, the PK was studied in a subset of 35 \n\npatients aged 3 years and older. The PK was comparable between the two age groups (\uf0653 to \uf03c12 years \n\nvs. \uf06512 to <18 years). After two rituximab IV infusions of 375 mg/m2 in each of the two induction \n\ncycles (cycle 1 and 2) followed by one rituximab IV infusion of 375 mg/m2 in each of the \n\nconsolidation cycles (cycle 3 and 4) the maximum concentration was highest after the fourth infusion \n\n(cycle 2) with a geometric mean of 347 \uf0ecg/mL followed by lower geometric mean maximum \n\nconcentrations thereafter (Cycle 4: 247 \uf0ecg/mL). With this dose regimen, trough levels were sustained \n\n(geometric means: 41.8 \u00b5g/mL (pre-dose Cycle 2; after 1 cycle), 67.7 \u00b5g/mL (pre-dose Cycle 3, after \n\n2 cycles) and 58.5 \u00b5g/mL (pre-dose Cycle 4, after 3 cycles)). The median elimination half-life in \n\npaediatric patients aged 3 years and older was 26 days. \n\n \n\nThe PK characteristics of rituximab in paediatric patients with DLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL were similar to \n\nwhat has been observed in adult NHL patients. \n\n \n\nNo PK data are available in the \u2265 6 months to < 3 years age group, however, population PK \n\nprediction supports comparable systemic exposure (AUC, Ctrough) in this age group compared to \u2265 3 \n\nyears (Table 24). Smaller baseline tumor size is related to higher exposure due to lower time \n\ndependent clearance, however, systemic exposures impacted by different tumor sizes remain in the \n\nrange of exposure that was efficacious and had an acceptable safety profile. \n\n \n\nTable 24: Predicted PK Parameters following the Rituximab Dosing Regimen in Paediatric \n\nDLBCL/BL/BAL/BLL \n\nAge group \u2265 6 mo to < 3 years \u2265 3 to < 12 years \u2265 12 to < 18 years \n\nCtrough (\u00b5g/mL) 47.5 (0.01-179) 51.4 (0.00-182) 44.1 (0.00-149) \n\nAUC1-4 cycles \n\n(\u00b5g*day/mL) \n13501 (278-31070) 11609 (135-31157) 11467 (110-27066) \n\nResults are presented as median (min \u2013 max); Ctrough is pre-dose Cycle 4. \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\n \n\nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased \n\nto 500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \n\npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 \u00b5g/mL (range, 97 \u2013 764 \u00b5g/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/m2 \n\ninfusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 \u2013 62 days). \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \n\nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n\n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 \n\n\n\n51  \n\nL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \n\nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \n\nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \n\nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger \n\nvolume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender-related \n\npharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not \n\nrequired. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \n\nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \n\ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following \n\nfirst infusion ranged from 157 to 171 \u03bcg/mL for 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 \u03bcg/mL \n\nfor 2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 \u03bcg/mL for \n\nthe 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 \u03bcg/mL for the 2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal \n\nelimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for \n\nthe 2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared \n\nto the first infusion for both doses. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \n\nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion \n\nwas 170 to 175 \u03bcg/mL for 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 \u03bcg/mL for 2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose. Cmax \n\nfollowing second infusion, was 207 \u03bcg/mL for the 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 \n\n\u03bcg/mL for the 2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, \n\nfollowing the second course, was 19 days for 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the \n\n2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \n\nsame dosage regimen (2 \u00d7 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \n\nconcentration of 369 \u03bcg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n\n \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) \n\n \n\nAdult Population \n\n \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \n\ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \n\nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 \n\nL/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. Maximum concentration during the first 180 \n\ndays (Cmax), minimum concentration at Day 180 (C180) and Cumulative area under the curve over \n\n180 days (AUC180) were (median [range]) 372.6 (252.3-533.5) \u00b5g/mL, 2.1 (0-29.3) \u00b5g/mL and \n\n10302 (3653-21874)\u00b5g/mL*days, respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in adult GPA and \n\nMPA patients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\n \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 25 children (6-17 years old) with GPA and MPA \n\nwho received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four doses, the estimated median terminal \n\nelimination half-life was 22 days (range, 11 to 42 days). Rituximab mean clearance and volume of \n\ndistribution were 0.221 L/day (range, 0. 0996 to 0.381 L/day) and 2.27 L (range 1.43 to 3.17 L) \n\nrespectively. Maximum concentration during the first 180 days (Cmax), minimum concentration at Day \n\n180 (C180) and Cumulative area under the curve over 180  days (AUC180) were (median [range]) \n\n382.8 (270.6-513.6) \u00b5g/mL, 0.9 (0-17.7) \u00b5g/mL and 9787 (4838-20446) \u00b5g/mL*day, respectively.The \n\nPK parameters of rituximab in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA were similar to those in adults \n\nwith GPA or MPA, once taking into account the BSA effect on clearance and volume of distribution \n\nparameters. \n\n \n\n\n\n52  \n\nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n \n\nThe PK parameters in adult PV patients receiving rituximab 1000 mg at Days 1, 15, 168, and 182 are \n\nsummarized in Table 25. \n\n \nTable 25 Population PK in adult PV patients from PV Study 2  \n\nParameter Infusion Cycle \n\n 1st cycle of 1000 mg \nDay 1 and Day 15 \n\nN=67 \n\n2nd cycle of 1000 mg \n\nDay 168 and Day 182 \nN=67 \n\nTerminal Half-life (days) \nMedian \n(Range) \n\n \n21.0 \n\n(9.3-36.2) \n\n \n26.5 \n\n(16.4-42.8) \nClearance (L/day) \n\nMean \n(Range) \n\n \n391 \n\n(159-1510) \n\n \n247 \n\n(128-454) \nCentral Volume of Distribution \n\n(L) \nMean \n\n(Range) \n\n \n3.52 \n\n(2.48-5.22) \n\n \n3.52 \n\n(2.48-5.22) \n\n \n\nFollowing the first two rituximab administrations (at day 1 and 15, corresponding to cycle 1), the PK \n\nparameters of rituximab in patients with PV were similar to those in patients with GPA/MPA and \n\npatients with RA. Following the last two administrations (at day 168 and 182, corresponding to cycle \n\n2), rituximab clearance decreased while the central volume of distribution remained unchanged. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \n\ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion \n\nof B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n\n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the \n\nfoetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the \n\nlymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied \n\nby a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these \n\nanimals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n\n \n\nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \n\nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \n\npotential of rituximab.  \n\n \n\nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \n\ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \n\nfemales were observed. \n\n \n\n \n6.

What Blitzima is and what it is used for  \n\n \nWhat Blitzima is \nBlitzima contains the active substance \u201crituximab\u201d. This is a type of protein called a \u201cmonoclonal \n\nantibody\u201d. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called \u201cB-Lymphocyte\u201d. When \n\nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \n\n \nWhat Blitzima is used for \nBlitzima may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. Your \n\ndoctor may prescribe Blitzima for the treatment of: \n\n \n\na) Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell \n\ncalled B-Lymphocytes. \n\nIn adults, Blitzima can be given alone or with other medicines called \u201cchemotherapy\u201d. \n\nIn adult patients where the treatment is working, Blitzima may be continued for 2 years after \n\ncompleting the initial treatment. \n\nIn children and adolescents, Blitzima is given in combination with \u201cchemotherapy\u201d. \n \n\nb) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a \n\nparticular lymphocyte, the B cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph \n\nnodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone \n\nmarrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you \n\nmay have. Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually \n\nremoved from the body by biological processes. \n\n \n\nc) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \n\nBlitzima is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with granulomatosis \n\nwith polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in \n\n\n\n71  \n\ncombination with corticosteroids. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are \n\ntwo forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may \n\naffect other organs as well. B-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n\n \n\nd) Pemphigus vulgaris \n\nBlitzima is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus \n\nvulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, \n\nnose, throat and genitals. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Blitzima  \n\n \nDo not take Blitzima if: \n\u2022 you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\n\u2022 you have a severe active infection at the moment \n\n\u2022 you have a weak immune system \n\n\u2022 you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. \n\n \n\nDo not have Blitzima if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse before you are given Blitzima. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Blitzima if: \n\n \n\n\u2022 you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nBlitzima could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \n\nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \n\nsigns of this infection. \n\n\u2022 you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \n\nproblems. \n\n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \n\nyou are given Blitzima. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \n\nBlitzima. \n\n \n\nIf you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris \n\nalso tell your doctor \n\u2022 if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Blitzima help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \n\nare given Blitzima. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer \n\nfrom severe infections. \n\n\u2022 if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to  \n\ntravel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Blitzima or in \n\nthe months after you receive Blitzima. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \n\nbefore you receive Blitzima. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n\nBlitzima can be used for the the treatment of children and adolescents, 6 months of age and older, with \n\nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, specifically CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), \n\nBurkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like \n\nlymphoma (BLL). \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \n\nunder 18 years of age. \n\n\n\n72  \n\n \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \n\nBlitzima can be used for treatment of children and adolescents, 2 years of age and older, with \n\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis) or microscopic \n\npolyangiitis. There is not much information about the use of Blitzima in children and adolescents with \n\nother diseases. \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \n\nunder 18 years of age. \n\n \nOther medicines and Blitzima \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \n\nbecause Blitzima can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect \n\nthe way Blitzima works. \n\n \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n\n\u2022 if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Blitzima. This is because some people have a fall in \n\ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Blitzima. \n\n\u2022 if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system \u2013 such as chemotherapy or \n\nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \n\nyou are given Blitzima. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \n\nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Blitzima can across the placenta and may affect \n\nyour baby. \n\nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception \n\nwhile using Blitzima. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with \n\nBlitzima. \n\nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with Blitzima. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \n\nafter your last treatment with Blitzima. This is because Blitzima may pass into breast milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Blitzima has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\nBlitzima contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 52.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL vial \n\nand 263.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 50 mL vial.  \n\nThis is equivalent to 2.6% (for 10mL vial) and 13.2% (for 50mL vial) of the recommended maximum \n\ndaily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\n3. How Blitzima is given  \n\n \nHow it is given \nBlitzima will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \n\nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any \n\nside effects. \n\nYou will always be given Blitzima as a drip (intravenous infusion). \n\n \n\nMedicines given before each Blitzima administration \nBefore you are given Blitzima, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \n\nreduce possible side effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n73  \n\nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \n\na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \n\n\u2022 If you are having Blitzima alone \n\nBlitzima will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with \n\nBlitzima are possible. \n\n\u2022 If you are having Blitzima with chemotherapy \n\nBlitzima will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \n\nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n\n\u2022 If you respond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima every 2 or 3 months for two \n\nyears. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n\n\u2022 If you are less than 18 years of age, you will be given Blitzima with chemotherapy.  You will \n\nreceive Blitzima up to 6 times over a 3.5 \u2013 5.5 month period. \n\n \n\nb) If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nWhen you are treated with Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive Blitzima \n\ninfusions on day 0 cycle 1 then day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles in total. Each cycle has a duration of \n\n28 days. The chemotherapy should be given after the Blitzima infusion. Your doctor will decide if \n\nyou should receive concomitant supportive therapy. \n\n \n\nc) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis  \nTreatment with Blitzima uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will \n\nusually be given by injection before the start of Blitzima treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth \n\nmay be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. If you are 18 years of age and \n\nolder and respond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima as a maintenance treatment. This \n\nwill be administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart, followed by 1 infusion \n\nevery 6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you longer with Blitzima (up to \n\n5 years), depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n\n \n\nd) If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris \n\nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you \n\nrespond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima as a maintenance treatment. This will be \n\nadministered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or \n\nyour doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \n\nthese reactions have been fatal. \n\n \n\nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less \n\nfrequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness \n\n(nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat \n\ndiscomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart \n\nattack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get \n\nworse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of \n\nthese symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require \n\nadditional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or \n\nimprove, the infusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second \n\ninfusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your Blitzima treatment if these reactions are serious. \n\n \n\n\n\n74  \n\nInfections \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including: \n \n\n\u2022 fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n\n\u2022 memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss \u2013 these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or \n\nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with Blitzima. \n\nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are \n\nlisted below under \u201cOther side effects\u201d. \n\n \n\nIf you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus \n\nvulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by your \n\ndoctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your partner or caregiver. \n\n \n\nSkin reactions \nVery rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur. Redness, often \n\nassociated with blisters, may appear on the skin or on mucous membranes, such as inside the mouth, \n\nthe genital areas or the eyelids, and fever may be present. Tell your doctor immediately if you have \n\nany of these symptoms. \n \n\nOther side effects include: \n\n \n\na) If you or your child are being treated for non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma or chronic \n\nlymphocytic leukaemia \n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\u2022 bacterial or viral infections, bronchitis \n\n\u2022 low number of white blood cells, with or without fever or blood cells called \u201cplatelets\u201d \n\n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\n\u2022 bald spots on the scalp, chills, headache \n\n\u2022 lower immunity \u2013 because of lower levels of anti-bodies called \u201cimmunoglobulins\u201d (IgG) \n\nin the blood which help protect against infection \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\u2022 infections of the blood (sepsis), pneumonia, shingles, cold, bronchial tube infections, \n\nfungal infections, infections of unknown origin, sinus inflammation, hepatitis B \n\n\u2022 low number of red blood cells (anaemia), low number of all blood cells \n\n\u2022 allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n\n\u2022 high blood sugar level, weight loss, swelling in the face and body, high levels of the \n\nenzyme \u201clactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\u201d in the blood, low calcium levels in the blood \n\n\u2022 unusual feelings of the skin \u2013 such as numbness, tingling, pricking, burning, a creeping \n\nskin feeling, reduced sense of touch \n\n\u2022 feeling restless, problems falling asleep, \n\n\u2022 becoming very red in the face and other areas of the skin as a consequence of dilation of \n\nthe blood vessels \n\n\u2022 feeling dizzy or anxious \n\n\u2022 producing more tears, tear duct problems, inflamed eye (conjunctivitis) \n\n\u2022 ringing sound in the ears, ear pain \n\n\u2022 heart problems \u2013 such as heart attack, uneven or fast heart rate \n\n\u2022 high or low blood pressure (low blood pressure especially when standing upright) \n\n\u2022 tightening of the muscles in the airways which causes wheezing (bronchospasm), \n\ninflammation, irritation in the lungs, throat or sinuses, being short of breath, runny \n\nnose \n\n\u2022 being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, pain in the stomach, irritation or ulcers in the throat \n\nand mouth, problems swallowing, constipation, indigestion \n\n\u2022 eating disorders, not eating enough, leading to weight loss \n\n\n\n75  \n\n\u2022 hives, increased sweating, night sweats \n\n\u2022 muscle problems \u2013 such as tight muscles, joint or muscle pain, back and neck pain \n\n\u2022 general discomfort or feeling uneasy or tired, shaking, signs of flu \n\n\u2022 multiple-organ failure. \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n\u2022 blood clotting problems, decrease of red blood cell production and increase of red blood \n\ncell destruction (aplastic haemolytic anaemia), swollen or enlarged lymph nodes \n\n\u2022 low mood and loss of interest or enjoyment in doing things, feeling nervous \n\n\u2022 taste problems \u2013 such as changes in the way things taste \n\n\u2022 heart problems \u2013 such as reduced heart rate or chest pain (angina) \n\n\u2022 asthma, too little oxygen reaching the body organs \n\n\u2022 swelling of the stomach. \n\n \n\nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n\n\u2022 short term increase in the amount of some types of anti-bodies in the blood (called \n\nimmunoglobulins \u2013 IgM), chemical disturbances in the blood caused by break-down of \n\ndying cancer cells \n\n\u2022 nerve damage in arms and legs, paralysed face \n\n\u2022 heart failure \n\n\u2022 inflammation of blood vessels including those leading to skin symptoms \n\n\u2022 respiratory failure \n\n\u2022 damage to the intestinal wall (perforation) \n\n\u2022 severe skin problems causing blisters that can be life-threatening.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what blitzima is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what blitzima is blitzima contains the active substance \"rituximab\". this is a type of protein called a \"monoclonal antibody\". it sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called \"b-lymphocyte\". when rituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. what blitzima is used for blitzima may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. your doctor may prescribe blitzima for the treatment of: a) non-hodgkin's lymphoma this is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell called b-lymphocytes. in adults, blitzima can be given alone or with other medicines called \"chemotherapy\". in adult patients where the treatment is working, blitzima may be continued for 2 years after completing the initial treatment. in children and adolescents, blitzima is given in combination with \"chemotherapy\". b) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. cll affects a particular lymphocyte, the b cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph nodes. patients with cll have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. the proliferation of these abnormal b-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. blitzima in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually removed from the body by biological processes. c) granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis blitzima is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in 71 combination with corticosteroids. granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. b-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. d) pemphigus vulgaris blitzima is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, nose, throat and genitals.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "blitzima", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "blitzima", "Type": "PROBLEM", "BeginOffset": 17, "EndOffset": 25}, {"Id":

infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection. you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given blitzima. your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with blitzima. if you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris also tell your doctor if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. the cells that are affected by blitzima help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given blitzima. also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severe infections. if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. some vaccines should not be given at

experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. if you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse. tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. you may require additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. when these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be continued. these reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. your doctor may decide to stop your blitzima treatment if these reactions are serious. infections tell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including: fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss these may be due to a very rare, serious brain infection, which has been fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or pml). you might get infections more easily during your treatment with blitzima. these are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. these are listed below under \"other side effects\". if you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information

protect against infection common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): infections of the blood (sepsis), pneumonia, shingles, cold, bronchial tube infections, fungal infections, infections of unknown origin, sinus inflammation, hepatitis b low number of red blood cells (anaemia), low number of all blood cells allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) high blood sugar level, weight loss,
