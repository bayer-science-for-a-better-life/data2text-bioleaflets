This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXermelo 250 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains telotristat etiprate equivalent to 250 mg telotristat ethyl. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 168 mg of lactose (as anhydrous). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite to off-white film-coated oval tablets (approximately 17 mm long by 7.5 mm wide) with \u2018T-E\u2019 \ndebossed on one side and \u2018250\u2019 debossed on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXermelo is indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhoea in combination with \nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 250 mg three times daily (tid).  \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  \nIt is recommended to reassess the benefit of continued therapy in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nBased on the high inter-subject variability observed, accumulation in a subset of patients with \ncarcinoid syndrome cannot be excluded. Therefore, intake of higher doses is not recommended (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nMissed doses  \nIn the event of a missed dose, patients should take their subsequent dose at the next scheduled time \npoint. Patients should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nElderly (65 years of age and above) \nNo specific dose recommendations are available for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo change in dose is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment; who are not \nrequiring dialysis (see section 5.2). As a precautionary measure, it is recommended that patients with \nsevere renal impairment will be monitored for signs of reduced tolerability. \n \nThe use of Xermelo is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis \n(eGFR < 15 mL/min requiring dialysis) because efficacy and safety of Xermelo in these patients has \nnot been established.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score A), it may be necessary to reduce the dose \nto 250 mg twice daily according to tolerability. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child \nPugh score B), it may be necessary to reduce the dose to 250 mg once daily according to tolerability. \nThe use of telotristat is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh \nscore C) (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of telotristat in the paediatric population in the indication of carcinoid \nsyndrome. \n \nMethod of administration  \nOral use \nXermelo should be taken with food (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic enzymes elevations \nElevations in hepatic enzymes were observed in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Laboratory monitoring \nof hepatic enzymes prior to and during telotristat therapy is recommended as clinically indicated. In \npatients with hepatic impairment, continuous monitoring for adverse events and worsening of liver \nfunction is recommended. \nPatients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have liver enzymes tested \nand telotristat should be discontinued if liver injury is suspected. Therapy with telotristat should not be \nresumed unless the liver injury can be explained by another cause. \n \nConstipation \nTelotristat reduces bowel movement (BM) frequency. Constipation was reported in patients using a \nhigher dose (500 mg). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of constipation. If \nconstipation develops, the use of telotristat and other concomitant therapies affecting bowel motility \nshould be re-evaluated. \n \nDepressive disorders \nDepression, depressed mood and decreased interest have been reported in clinical trials and from post-\nmarketing in some patients treated with telotristat (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to \nreport any symptoms of depression, depressed mood and decreased interest to their physicians.  \n \nLactose intolerance \nXermelo contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on Xermelo \nShort acting octreotide \nConcomitant administration of short-acting octreotide with Xermelo significantly decreased the \nsystemic exposure of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, the active metabolite (see section 5.2). Short-\nacting octreotide should be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of Xermelo if \ntreatment with short-acting octreotide is needed in combination with Xermelo. \n \nCarboxylesterase 2 (CES2) inhibitors \nThe IC50 of the inhibition of loperamide on the metabolism of telotristat ethyl by CES2 was 5.2 \u00b5M \n(see section 5.2). In phase 3 clinical trials, telotristat was routinely combined with loperamide with no \nevidence of safety concerns. \n \nEffect of Xermelo on other medicinal products  \nCYP2B6 substrates \nTelotristat induced CYP2B6 in vitro (see section 5.2). Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the \nefficacy of medicinal products that are CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. valproic acid, bupropion, sertraline) \nby decreasing their systemic exposure. Monitoring for suboptimal efficacy is recommended. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nConcomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the efficacy of medicinal products that are CYP3A4 \nsubstrates (e.g. midazolam, everolimus, sunitinib, simvastatin, ethinyloestradiol, amlodipine, \ncyclosporine\u2026) by decreasing their systemic exposure (see section 5.2). Monitoring for suboptimal \nefficacy is recommended. \n \nCarboxylesterase 2 (CES2) substrates \nConcomitant use of Xermelo may change the exposure of medicinal products that are CES2 substrates \n(e.g. prasugrel, irinotecan, capecitabine and flutamide) (see section 5.2). If co-administration is \nunavoidable, monitor for suboptimal efficacy and safety events.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment \nwith telotristat. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of telotristat in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Xermelo is not recommended during pregnancy and in women \nof childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether telotristat ethyl and its metabolite are excreted in human breast milk. A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Patients should not breast-feed during telotristat treatment. \n \nFertility \nNo studies on the effect of telotristat on human fertility have been conducted. Telotristat had no effect \non fertility in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTelotristat has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue may occur following \nadministration of telotristat (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with telotristat were abdominal pain \n(26%), gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (11%) and fatigue (10%). They were generally of mild \nor moderate intensity. The most frequently reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of \ntelotristat was abdominal pain in 7.1% of patients (5/70). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported in a pooled safety dataset of 70 patients with carcinoid syndrome receiving \ntelotristat ethyl 250 mg tid in combination with SSA therapy in placebo-controlled clinical trials are \nlisted in Table 1. Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency \nusing the following convention: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness  \n \nTable 1 - Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Xermelo \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Decreased appetite  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Depression, depressed \nmood \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal paina, \nnausea \n\nAbdominal distension, \nConstipation,  \nFlatulence \n\nFaecalomac, intestinal \nobstruction \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nGamma-\nglutamyltransferase \nincreasedb \n\nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased (ALT),  \nAspartate \naminotransferase increased \n(AST), \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(ALP) \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue Oedema peripheral,  \nPyrexia \n\n \n\na Abdominal pain (including upper and lower abdominal pain) \nb Gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (including preferred terms of gamma-glutamyl transferase \nincreased, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and liver function test abnormal / hepatic enzyme increased \nfor which gamma-glutamyl transferase was increased). \nc Faecaloma has only been observed in a clinical study at a dosage of 500mg tid (twice the \nrecommended dose). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHepatic enzymes elevations \nElevations in ALT >3 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP>2 ULN have been reported in patients \nreceiving therapy with telotristat, most cases being reported at a higher dose (500 mg). These have not \nbeen associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. The increases were largely \nreversible on dose interruption or reduction, or recovered whilst maintaining treatment at the same \ndose. For clinical management of elevated hepatic enzymes, see section 4.4. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most frequently reported adverse event in patients receiving telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid was \nabdominal pain (25.7%; 18/70) versus placebo (19.7%; 14/71). Abdominal distension was reported in \n7.1% of patients (5/70) receiving telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid, versus 4.2% in the placebo group (3/71). \nFlatulence was seen in 5.7% of patients (4/70) and 1.4% (1/71) in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg and \nplacebo groups, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate and did not limit study treatment.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nConstipation was reported in 5.7% of patients (4/70) in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg group and in 4.2% \nof patients (3/71) in the placebo group. Serious constipation was observed in 3 patients treated with a \nhigher dose (500 mg) in the overall safety population (239 patients). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms  \nThere is limited clinical experience with telotristat overdose in humans. Gastrointestinal disorders \nincluding nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting have been reported in healthy subjects \ntaking a single dose of 1,500 mg in a phase 1 study.  \n \nManagement  \nTreatment of an overdose should include general symptomatic management. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products: Various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX15 \n \nMechanism of action \nBoth the prodrug (telotristat ethyl) and its active metabolite (telotristat) are inhibitors of L-tryptophan \nhydroxylases (TPH1 and TPH2, the rate limiting steps in serotonin biosynthesis). Serotonin plays a \ncritical role in regulating several major physiological processes, including secretion, motility, \ninflammation, and sensation of the gastrointestinal tract, and is over-secreted in patients with carcinoid \nsyndrome. Through inhibition of peripheral TPH1, telotristat reduces the production of serotonin, thus \nalleviating symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn Phase 1 studies, dosing with telotristat ethyl in healthy subjects (dose range: 100 mg once daily to \n500 mg tid) produced statistically significant reductions from baseline in whole blood serotonin and \n24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (u5-HIAA) compared with placebo.  \nIn patients with carcinoid syndrome, telotristat resulted in reductions in u5-HIAA (refer to Table 3 for \nTELESTAR and information provided for TELECAST). Statistically significant reductions in \nu5-HIAA were seen for telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid compared with placebo in both Phase 3 studies. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of telotristat for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome in patients with \nmetastatic neuroendocrine tumours who were receiving SSA therapy was established in a 12-week \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multicentre phase 3 trial in adult patients, which \nincluded a 36-week extension during which all patients were treated with open-label telotristat \n(TELESTAR Study). \n \nA total of 135 patients were evaluated for efficacy. The mean age was 64 years (range 37 to 88 years), \n52% were male and 90% were white. All patients had well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine \ntumours and carcinoid syndrome. They were on SSA therapy and had \u22654 daily BM.  \n \nThe study included a 12-week double-blind treatment (DBT) period, in which patients initially \nreceived placebo (n=45), telotristat ethyl 250 mg (n=45) or a higher dose (telotristat ethyl 500 mg; \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nn=45) tid. During the study, patients were allowed to use rescue medication (short-acting SSA \ntherapy) and anti-diarrhoeals for symptomatic relief but were required to be on stable-dose long-acting \nSSA therapy for the duration of the DBT period. Xermelo was taken within 15 minutes before, or \nwithin 1 hour after food. \n \nTable 2: BM response (TELESTAR Study) \n\n Parameter Placebo Telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid  \n\nBMs/day at baseline  \nNumber of patients  45 45 \nBaseline mean (SD) 5.2 (1.35) 6.1 (2.07) \n\nPrimary endpoint: \nchange from baseline \nin BMs/day averaged \nover 12 weeks  \n\nNumber of patients  45 45 \n\nChange averaged \nover 12 weeks: mean \n(SD) \n\n\u02d70.6 (0.83) \u02d71.4 (1.37) \n\nANCOVAa \n\nLeast Square mean \ndifference \n\n--- -0.6 \n\n97.5% CL for \ndifference --- -1.16, -0.06 \n\np value --- 0.01 \nPercentage of \npatients with durable \nresponseb  \n\nNumber of patients  45 45 \n\nResponder, n (%) 9 (20.0) 20 (44.4)c \n\nBM = bowel movement; CL=confidence limit; tid=three times daily; SD=standard deviation. \na.

Questions were asked to blinded \nparticipants to further characterise the degree of change experienced during the trial. There were \n12 patients who were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d, and all of them were on telotristat. The proportions of patients \nwho were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d were 0/9 (0%) on placebo, 5/9 (56%) on telotristat ethyl 250 mg tid and \n7/15 (47%) on a higher dose of telotristat ethyl. \n \nOverall, 18 patients (13.2%) prematurely discontinued from the study during the DBT Period, \n7 patients in the placebo group, 3 in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg group and 8 in the higher dose group. \nAt the conclusion of the 12-week DBT period, 115 patients (85.2%) entered the 36-week open-label \nextension period, where all patients were titrated to receive a higher dose of telotristat ethyl (500 mg) \ntid.  \n \nIn a phase 3 study of similar design (TELECAST), a total of 76 patients were evaluated for efficacy. \nThe mean age was 63 years (range 35 to 84 years), 55% were male and 97% were white. \nAll patients had well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumour with carcinoid syndrome. Most \npatients (92.1%) had fewer than 4 BM per day and all except 9 were treated by SSA therapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline in u5-HIAA at Week 12. The mean \nu5-HIAA excretion at baseline was 69.1 mg/24hours in the 250 mg group (n=17) and \n84.8 mg/24 hours in the placebo group (n=22). The percent change from baseline in u5-HIAA \nexcretion at week 12 was +97.7% in the placebo group versus -33.2% in the 250 mg group. \n \nThe mean number of daily BM at baseline was 2.2 and 2.5 respectively in the placebo (n=25) and \n250 mg group (n=25). The change from baseline in daily BM averaged over 12 weeks was +0.1 and  \n-0.5 in the placebo and 250 mg groups respectively. Telotristat ethyl 250 mg showed that stool \nconsistency, as measured by Bristol Stool Form Scale, was improved compared with placebo. There \nwere 40% patients (10/25) with durable response (as defined in Table2) in the telotristat ethyl 250 mg \ngroup, versus 0% in the placebo group (0/26) (p=0.001). \n \nThe long-term safety and tolerability of telotristat was evaluated in a nonpivotal (nonrandomized), \nphase 3, multicentre, open-label, long-term extension study. Patients having participated in any \nXermelo phase 2 or phase 3 carcinoid syndrome study were eligible to enter the study at the same dose \nlevel and regimen as identified in their original study, for at least 84 weeks of treatment. No new \nsignificant safety signals were identified.  \nThe secondary objective of this study was to evaluate changes in patients\u2019 quality of life (QOL) \nthrough Week 84. QOL was generally stable over the course of the study. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntelotristat in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite have been characterised in healthy \nvolunteers and patients with carcinoid syndrome.  \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration to healthy volunteers, telotristat ethyl was rapidly absorbed, and almost \ncompletely converted to its active metabolite. Peak plasma levels of telotristat ethyl were achieved in \n0.53 to 2.00 hours and those of the active metabolite in 1.50 to 3.00 hours after oral administration.  \nFollowing administration of a single 500 mg dose of telotristat ethyl (twice the recommended dose) \nunder fasted conditions in healthy subjects, the mean Cmax and AUC0-inf were 4.4 ng/mL and \n6.23 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively for telotristat ethyl. The mean Cmax and AUC0-inf were 610 ng/mL and \n2320 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively for telotristat. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nIn patients with carcinoid syndrome on long-acting SSA therapy, there was also a rapid conversion of \ntelotristat ethyl to its active metabolite. A high variability (% CV range of 18% to 99%) in telotristat \nethyl and its active metabolite parameters was observed within the overall PK. The mean PK \nparameters for telotristat ethyl and the active metabolite appeared unchanged between week 24 and \nweek 48, suggesting the achievement of steady-state conditions at or prior to week 24.  \n \nFood effect \nIn a food effect study administration of telotristat ethyl 500 mg with a high-fat meal resulted in higher \nexposure to the parent compound (Cmax, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-\u221e being 112%, 272%, and 264% higher, \nrespectively compared with the fasted state) and its active metabolite (Cmax, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-\u221e, \n47%, 32%, and 33% higher, respectively compared with the fasted state).  \n \nDistribution \nBoth telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite are > 99% bound to human plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \nAfter oral administration, telotristat ethyl undergoes hydrolysis via carboxylesterases to its active and \nmajor metabolite. The only metabolite of telotristat (active metabolite) representing consistently \n> 10% of total plasma drug-related material was its oxidative decarboxylated deaminated metabolite, \nLP-951757. Systemic exposure to LP-951757 was about 35% of the systemic exposure to telotristat \n(active metabolite) in the mass balance study. LP-951757 was pharmacologically inactive at TPH1 in \nvitro.  \n \nInteractions \nCytochromes \nCYP2B6  \nIn vitro telotristat (active metabolite) caused a concentration dependent increase in CYP2B6 mRNA \nlevels (>2-fold increase and > 20% of the positive control, with a maximum observed effect similar to \nthe positive control), suggesting possible CYP2B6 induction (see section 4.5). \n \nCYP3A4 \nTelotristat ethyl and its active metabolite were not shown to be inducers of CYP3A4 at systemically \nrelevant concentrations, based on in vitro findings. The potential of telotristat ethyl as an inducer of \nCYP3A4 was not assessed at concentrations expectable at the intestinal level, due to its low solubility \nin vitro. \nIn vitro telotristat ethyl engages in an allosteric interaction with CYP3A4 resulting at the same time in \na reduced conversion of midazolam to 1\u2019-OH-MDZ, and increased conversion to 4-OH-MDZ. \n \nIn an in vivo clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 \nsubstrate), following administration of multiple doses of telotristat ethyl, the systemic exposure to \nconcomitant midazolam was significantly decreased (see section 4.5). When 3 mg midazolam was \ncoadministered orally after 5-day treatment with telotristat ethyl 500 mg tid (twice the recommended \ndose), the mean Cmax, and AUC0-inf for midazolam were decreased by 25%, and 48%, respectively, \ncompared with administration of midazolam alone. The mean Cmax, and AUC0-inf for the active \nmetabolite, 1\u2019-hydroxymidazolam, were also decreased by 34%, and 48%, respectively.  \n \nOther CYPs \nBased on in vitro findings, no clinically-relevant interaction is expected with other cytochromes P450. \n \nCarboxylesterases  \nThe IC50 of the inhibition of loperamide on the metabolism of telotristat ethyl by CES2 was 5.2 \u00b5M \n(see section 4.5). \nIn vitro, telotristat ethyl inhibited CES2 with an IC50 approximately of 0.56 \u03bcM. \n \nTransporters  \n \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Multi-drug Resistance associated Protein 2 (MRP-2) \n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn vitro telotristat ethyl inhibited P-gp, but its active metabolite did not at the clinically relevant \nconcentrations. \nTelotristat ethyl inhibited MRP2-mediated transport (98% inhibition).  \nIn a specific clinical DDI study, the Cmax and AUC of fexofenadine (a P-gp and MRP-2 substrate) \nincreased by 16% when a single 180 mg dose of fexofenadine was co-administered orally with a dose \nof telotristat ethyl 500 mg administered tid (twice the recommended dose) for 5 days. Based on the \nsmall increase observed, clinically meaningful interactions with P-gp and MRP-2 substrates are \nunlikely. \n \nBreast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) \nIn vitro telotristat ethyl inhibited BCRP (IC50 = 20 \u00b5M), but its active metabolite telotristat did not \nshow any significant inhibition of BCRP activity (IC50 > 30 \u00b5M). The potential for in vivo drug \ninteraction via inhibition of BCRP is considered low. \n \nOther transporters \nBased on in vitro findings, no clinically-relevant interaction is expected with other transporters.  \n \nShort-acting octreotide \nA study examining the effect of short-acting octreotide (3 doses of 200\u25e6micrograms given 8\u25e6hours \napart) on the single dose pharmacokinetics of Xermelo in normal healthy volunteers showed an 83% \nand 81% decrease in Cmax and AUC of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, respectively (see section 4.5). \nReduced exposures were not observed in a 12\u25e6week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, \nmulticentre clinical trial in adult patients with carcinoid syndrome on long-acting SSA therapy. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nAcid Reducers \nConcomitant use of telotristat etiprate (Xermelo, the hippurate salt of telotristat ethyl) with acid-\nreducers (omeprazole and famotidine) showed that the AUC of telotristat ethyl was increased 2-3 fold, \nwhile the AUC of the active metabolite (telotristat) was not changed. Since telotristat ethyl is rapidly \nconverted to its active metabolite, which is > 25\u00d7 more active than telotristat ethyl, no dose \nadjustments are required when using Xermelo with acid reducers. \n \nElimination \nFollowing a single 500 mg oral dose of 14C-telotristat ethyl, approximately 93% of the dose was \nrecovered. The majority was eliminated in the faeces. \n \nTelotristat ethyl and telotristat have a low renal elimination following oral administration (less than \n1% of the dose recovered from the urine).  \nFollowing a single oral 250 mg dose of telotristat ethyl to heathy volunteers, urine concentrations of \ntelotristat ethyl were close to or below the limit of quantification (<0.1 ng/mL). The renal clearance of \ntelotristat was 0.126 L/h.  \n \nThe apparent half-life of telotristat ethyl in normal healthy volunteers following a single 500 mg oral \ndose 14C-telotristat ethyl was approximately 0.6 hour and that of its active metabolite was 5 hours. \nFollowing administration of 500 mg tid, the apparent terminal half-life was approximately 11 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nIn patients treated at 250 mg tid, a slight accumulation of telotristat levels was observed with a median \naccumulation ratio based on AUC0-4h of 1.55 [minimum, 0.25; maximum, 5.00; n=11; week 12], with a \nhigh inter-subject variability (%CV = 72%). In patients treated at 500 mg tid (twice the recommended \ndose), a median accumulation ratio based on AUC0-4h of 1.095 (minimum, 0.274; maximum, 11.46; \nn=16; week 24) was observed, with a high inter-subject variability (%CV = 141.8%).  \nBased on the high inter-subject variability observed, accumulation in a subset of patients with CS \ncannot be excluded. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n\n\n12 \n\nElderly \nThe influence of age on the pharmacokinetics of telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite has not been \nconclusively evaluated. No specific study has been performed in the elderly population.  \n \nRenal impairment \nA study was conducted to investigate the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of a \nsingle dose of telotristat ethyl 250 mg. Eight subjects with severe to moderate renal impairment not \nrequiring dialysis [eGFR \u2264 33 mL/min at screening and \u226440 mL/min at the day prior to dosing] and \neight healthy to mildly impaired subjects [eGFR \u226588 mL/min at screening and \u226583 mL/min at the day \nprior to dosing] were included in this study. \nIn the subjects with severe to moderate renal impairment, an increase (1.3- fold) in peak exposure \nCmax of telotristat ethyl and an increase (<1.52- fold) in plasma exposure (AUC) and Cmax of its \nactive metabolite telotristat was observed compared to healthy to mildly impaired subjects.  \nVariability of the main plasma telotristat PK parameters was higher in subjects with severe to \nmoderate renal impairment, with CV% ranging from 53.3% for Cmax to 77.3% for AUC as compared \nto 45.4% for Cmax and 39.7% for AUC in healthy to mildly impaired subjects, respectively. \n \nAdministration of a single dose of 250 mg was well tolerated in subjects with severe to moderate renal \nimpairment.  \n \nOverall, severe to moderate renal impairment did not result in a clinically meaningful change in the \nPK profile or safety of telotristat ethyl and its metabolite telotristat. Therefore, dose adjustment does \nnot appear necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment; who are not requiring \ndialysis. Given the high variability observed, it is recommended as a precautionary measure that \npatients with severe renal impairment will be monitored for signs of reduced tolerability. \n \nThe efficacy and safety in patients with end-stage renal disease who require dialysis (eGFR < 15 \nmL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 requiring dialysis) has not been established. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA hepatic impairment study was conducted in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment \nand in healthy subjects. At a single dose of 500 mg, exposures to the parent compound and its active \nmetabolite (based on AUC0-last) were higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment (2.3- and 2.4-\nfold, respectively) and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (3.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively) \ncompared with healthy subjects. Administration of a single dose of 500 mg was well tolerated. A \nreduction in dose may be necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (respectively \nChild Pugh score A and B) based on tolerability (see section 4.2). \n \nA further hepatic impairment study was conducted in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and in \nhealthy subjects. At a single dose of 250 mg, exposure to the parent compound (AUCt and Cmax) was \nincreased 317.0% and 529.5%, respectively, and to the active metabolite (AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax) \n497%, 500%, and 217%, respectively, for subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to \nsubjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the half-life of the active metabolite was increased, \ni.e. the mean half life was 16.0 hours in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to 5.47 \nhours in healthy subjects. Based on these findings, the use of telotristat etiprate is not recommended in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score C) (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and \ndevelopment.  \n \nIn rats decrease in brain serotonin (5-HT) was observed at doses\u22651,000 mg/kg/day of telotristat \netiprate per os. Brain 5-HIAA levels were unchanged at all doses of telotristat ethyl examined. This is \n\n\n\n13 \n\napproximately 14 times the human exposure (AUC total) at the maximum recommended human dose \n(MRHD) of 750 mg/day for the active metabolite LP-778902. \n \nIn a 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats a No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of \n50 mg/kg/day was determined. This is approximately 0.4 times the human exposure (AUC total) at \nMRHD of 750 mg/day for the active metabolite LP-778902. At doses of 200 and 500 mg/kg/day \ndegeneration/necrosis in the nonglandular and/or glandular portions of the stomach and/or increased \nprotein droplets in the glandular portions were observed. The microscopic changes in the \ngastrointestinal tract reversed with a 4-week recovery period. Relevance of these gastrointestinal \nfindings to humans is unknown.  \n \nIn dogs decreases in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were observed at dose of 200 mg/kg/day and \n30 mg/kg/day of telotristat etiprate per os, respectively. This is approximately 21 times the human \nexposure (AUC total) at MRHD of 750 mg/day for the active metabolite LP-778902. No decrease in \nbrain 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were observed after intravenous application of active metabolite. The \nclinical significance of the decrease in brain 5-HIAA with or without a concomitant decrease in brain \n5-HT is unknown.  \n \nIn a 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs NOAEL of 300 mg/kg/day was determined. Clinical \nsigns were limited to increase in frequency of liquid faeces at all doses. This is approximately 20 times \nthe human exposure (AUC total) at MRHD of 750 mg/day for the active metabolite LP-778902. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of telotristat etiprate was studied in transgenic mice (26 weeks) and rats \n(104 weeks). These studies confirmed that telotristat did not increase the incidence of tumours in both \nspecies and sexes, at doses corresponding to an exposure of approximately 10- to 15-fold and 2- to \n4.5-fold the human exposure to the active metabolite at the MRHD in mice and rats, respectively. \n \nIn rats, there were no adverse effects on male and female fertility. Prenatal development in rats and \nrabbits was affected by increased prenatal lethality (increased early and late resorptions), while no \nadverse effects were noted on postnatal development in rats. The NOAEL for parental / maternal / \nprenatal and postnatal toxicity is 500 mg/kg/day in rats corresponding to 3 to 4 times the estimated \nhuman exposure (AUC0-24) of the active metabolite LP-778902 at the MRHD. In rabbits the NOAEL \nfor maternal and prenatal toxicity is 125 mg/kg/d corresponding to 1.5 to 4 times the estimated human \nexposure (AUC0-24) of the active metabolite LP-778902 at the MRHD. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n23 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nXermelo 250 mg film-coated tablets \ntelotristat ethyl  \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xermelo is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Xermelo  \n3. How to take Xermelo  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Xermelo  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xermelo is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Xermelo is \nThis medicine contains the active substance telotristat ethyl.  \n \nWhat Xermelo is used for \nThis medicine is used in adults with a condition called \u2018carcinoid syndrome\u2019. This is when a tumour, \ncalled a \u2018neuroendocrine tumour\u2019, releases a substance called serotonin into your bloodstream.  \n \nYour doctor will prescribe this medicine if your diarrhoea is not well controlled with injections of \nother medicines called \u2018somatostatin analogues\u2019 (lanreotide or octreotide). You should keep having \ninjections of these other medicines when taking Xermelo. \n \nHow Xermelo works \nWhen the tumour releases too much serotonin into your bloodstream you can get diarrhoea.  \nThis medicine works by reducing the amount of serotonin made by the tumour. It will reduce your \ndiarrhoea.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xermelo  \n \nDo not take Xermelo \n- if you are allergic to telotristat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xermelo: \n\u2022 if you have liver problems. This is because this medicine is not recommended for use in patients \n\nwith severe liver problems. Your doctor may decide to decrease your daily dose of Xermelo in \n\n\n\n24 \n\ncases where your liver problems are considered mild or moderate. Your doctor will also monitor \nyour liver. \n\n\u2022 if you have end-stage kidney disease or are on dialysis. This is because this medicine has not been \ntested in patients with end-stage kidney disease, requiring dialysis.  \n\n \nLook out for side effects \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following signs and symptoms that suggest that \nyour liver may not be working properly: \n\u2022 feeling or being sick (unexplained nausea or vomiting), abnormally dark urine, yellow skin or eyes, \n\npain in the upper right belly.  \nYour doctor will do blood tests to check your liver and will decide whether you should keep taking \nthis medicine. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist: \n\u2022 if you feel down, depressed, or if you feel you have no interest or take any pleasure in doing your \n\nnormal activities, whilst taking this medicine \n\u2022 if you have signs of constipation, as telotristat reduces the number of your bowel movements. \n\n \nTests \n\u2022 Your doctor may carry out blood tests before you start taking this medicine and while you are \n\ntaking it. This is to check that your liver is working normally. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended in patients below 18 years old. This is because the medicine has \nnot been tested in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Xermelo \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Xermelo can affect the way some other medicines work, or other medicines \ncan affect the way Xermelo works. This could mean that your doctor needs to change the dose(s) that \nyou take. You should tell your doctor about every medicine. This includes:  \n\u2022 medicines for diarrhoea. Xermelo and these medicines reduce the number of your bowel \n\nmovements and taken together, they can cause severe constipation. Your doctor may need to \nchange the dose of your medicines.  \n\n\u2022 medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as valproic acid. \n\u2022 medicines used to treat your neuroendocrine tumour, such as sunitinib or everolimus. \n\u2022 medicines to treat depression, such as bupropion or sertraline. \n\u2022 medicines used to avoid transplant rejection, such as cyclosporine. \n\u2022 medicines used to lower cholesterol levels, such as simvastatin. \n\u2022 oral contraceptives, such as ethinyloestradiol.  \n\u2022 medicines used to treat high blood pressure, such as amlodipine. \n\u2022 medicines used to treat some types of cancers, such as irinotecan, capecitabine and flutamide. \n\u2022 medicines used to reduce the chance of a blood clot forming, such as prasugrel. \n\u2022 octreotide. If you need treatment with octreotide subcutaneous injections, you should have your \n\ninjection at least 30 minutes after taking Xermelo. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \nYou should not take this medicine if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. It is not known how \ntelotristat may affect the baby.  \nWomen should use effective methods of contraception while taking this medicine. \nYou should not breast-feed if you are taking Xermelo, as this medicine may be passed on to your \nbaby.  \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nDriving and using machines \nTelotristat may have a small effect on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ntired, you should wait until you feel better before driving or using any tools or machines. \n \nXermelo contains lactose \nXermelo contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Xermelo \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is one tablet (250 mg) three times a day. The maximum dose of Xermelo is \n750 mg in 24 hours. \nYour doctor will decide for how long you should take Xermelo. \nIf you have liver problems, your doctor may decide to reduce your daily dose of Xermelo. \n \nTaking this medicine \n\u2022 Always take this medicine with a meal or some food.  \n\u2022 You should keep having injections of somatostatin analogues (lanreotide or octreotide) when taking \n\nXermelo. \n \nIf you take more Xermelo than you should \nYou may feel sick or be sick, have diarrhoea or stomach ache. Talk to a doctor. Take the medicine \npack with you.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xermelo \nIf you forget to take a dose, take your next dose when it is due, skipping the missed dose. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Xermelo \nDo not stop taking Xermelo without talking with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\u2022 feeling or being sick, abnormally dark urine, yellow skin or eyes, pain in the upper right belly. \n\nThese may be signs that your liver is not working properly.
