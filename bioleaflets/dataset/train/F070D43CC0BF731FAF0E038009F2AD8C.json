NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON 50 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 50 mg of cysteamine (as mercaptamine bitartrate) . \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard Capsule \n\nWhite, opaque hard capsules with CYSTA 50 on the body and MYLAN on the cap. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces \n\ncystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis \n\npatients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ntreatment of cystinosis. \n\n \n\nThe goal of therapy is to keep leucocyte cystine levels below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. White \n\nblood cell (WBC) cystine levels should therefore be monitored to adjust the dose. The WBC levels \n\nshould be measured 5 to 6 hours after dosing and should be checked frequently when initiating therapy \n\n(e.g. monthly) and every 3-4 months when on a stable dose. \n\n \n\n\u2022 For children up to age 12 years, CYSTAGON dosing should be on the basis of body surface \n\narea (g/m2/day). The recommended dose is 1.30 g/m2/day of the free base divided four times \n\ndaily.  \n\n\u2022 For patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the recommended CYSTAGON dose is \n\n2 g/day, divided four times daily. \n\n \n\nStarting doses should be 1/4 to 1/6 of the expected maintenance dose, increased gradually over 4-\n\n6 weeks to avoid intolerance. The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the \n\nleucocyte cystine level remains >1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The maximum dose of CYSTAGON \n\nused in clinical trials was 1.95 g/m2/day. \n\nThe use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDigestive tolerance of cysteamine is improved when the medicinal product is taken just after or with \n\nfood. \n\n \n\nIn children who are at risk of aspiration, aged approximately 6 years and under, the hard capsules \n\nshould be opened and the content sprinkled on food. Experience suggests that foods such as milk, \n\npotatoes and other starch based products seem to be appropriate for mixing with the powder. However, \n\nacidic drinks, e.g. orange juice, should generally be avoided as the powder tends not to mix well and \n\nmay precipitate out. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients on dialysis or post-transplantation: \n\nExperience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e.leading \n\nto more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the leucocyte cystine \n\nlevels is recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic insufficiency: \n\nDose adjustment is not normally required; however, leucocyte cystine levels should be monitored. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \n\nThe use of CYSTAGON is contra-indicated during breast-feeding. CYSTAGON should not be used \n\nduring pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary (see section 4.6 and \n\nsection 5.3 as it is teratogenic in animals. \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON is contraindicated in patients who have developed hypersensitivity to penicillamine. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON therapy must be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of nephropathic \n\ncystinosis to achieve maximum benefit. \n\n \n\nNephropathic cystinosis must have been diagnosed by both clinical signs and biochemical \n\ninvestigations (leucocyte cystine measurements). \n\n \n\nCases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in \n\nchildren treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or \n\ncystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. These skin lesions \n\nwere associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone lesions. \n\nIt is therefore recommended to monitor regularly skin and to consider X-ray examinations of the bone \n\nas necessary. Self-examination of the skin by the patient or the parents should also be advised. If any \n\nsimilar skin or bone abnormalities appear, it is recommended to decrease the dose of CYSTAGON. \n\nThe use of doses higher than 1.95g/m2/day is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of blood cell count is recommended on a regular basis. \n\n \n\nOral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where \n\ncysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue. \n\n \n\nIn contrast to phosphocysteamine, CYSTAGON does not contain phosphate. Most patients will \n\nalready be receiving phosphate supplements and the dose of these may need to be altered when \n\nCYSTAGON is substituted for phosphocysteamine. \n\n \n\nIntact CYSTAGON hard capsules should not be administered to children under the age of \n\napproximately 6 years due to risk of aspiration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n  \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed \n\nCYSTAGON can be administered with electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for \n\nmanagement of the Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormones. Indomethacin and \n\nCYSTAGON have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients with kidney \n\ntransplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of cysteamine bitartrate in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk \n\nfor humans is unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. \n\nTherefore, CYSTAGON should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, \n\nunless clearly necessary. \n\nIf a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient \n\nmust be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine. \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON excretion in human's milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in \n\nbreast-feeding mothers and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contraindicated in women \n\ntaking CYSTAGON.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCYSTAGON has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \n\nCYSTAGON may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially \n\nhazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nApproximately 35% of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve \n\nthe gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. When these effects appear at the initiation of \n\ncysteamine therapy, temporary suspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in \n\nimproving tolerance. \n\n \n\nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriouness \n\n \n\nInvestigations Common: Liver function tests abnormal \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon: Leukopenia \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Headache, encephalopathy \n\nUncommon: Somnolence, convulsions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea \n\nCommon: Abdominal pain, breath odour, dyspepsia, \n\ngastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Gastrointestinal ulcer \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: Nephrotic syndrome \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: Skin odour abnormal, rash \n\nUncommon: Hair colour changes, skin striae, skin \n\nfragility (molluscoid pseudotumor on elbows) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu \n\nvalgum, osteopenia, compression fracture, scoliosis. \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common: Anorexia \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nVery  common: Lethargy, pyrexia \n\nCommon: Asthenia \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon: Anaphylactic reaction \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Uncommon: Nervousness, hallucination \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with progressive \n\nrecovery after treatment discontinuation. In some cases, histology showed a membranous \n\nglomerulonephritis of the renal allograft and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis. \n\n \n\nCases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in \n\nchildren chronically treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine \n\nchlorhydrate or cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. \n\nIn some cases, these skin lesions were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone \n\nlesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain \n\nand hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression fractures, and scoliosis. \n\nIn cases where histopathological examination of the skin was performed, the results suggested \n\nangioendotheliomatosis. \n\nOne patient subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy.  \n\nIn some patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed after CYSTAGON dose reduction. \n\nCysteamine mechanism of action by interfering with the cross-linking of collagen fibers has been \n\npostulated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nAn overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. \n\n \n\nShould overdosage occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported \n\nappropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by \n\nhaemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Alimentary tract and metabolism product, ATC code: A16AA04.  \n\n \n\nNormal individuals and heterozygous subjects for cystinosis have white cell cystine levels of < 0.2, \n\nand usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively. Individuals with nephropathic \n\ncystinosis have elevations of white cell cystine above 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein \n\n \n\nCysteamine reacts with cystine to form the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine.  \n\nThe mixed disulfide is then exported from the lysosomes by an intact lysine transport system. The \n\ndecrease in leucocyte cystine levels is correlated to the cysteamine plasma concentration over the six \n\nhours following the administration of CYSTAGON.  \n\n \n\nThe leucocyte cystine level reaches its minimum (mean (\uf0b1 sd) value: 1.8 \uf0b1 0.8 hours) slightly later \n\nthan the peak plasma cysteamine concentration (mean (\uf0b1 sd) value: 1.4 \uf0b1 0.4 hours) and returns to its \n\nbaseline level as the plasma cysteamine concentration decreases at 6 hours post-dose. \n\n \n\nIn one clinical study, baseline white cell cystine levels were 3.73 (range 0.13 to 19.8) nmol \n\nhemicystine/mg protein and were maintained close to 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein with a \n\ncysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/m2/day.  \n\nAn earlier study treated 94 children with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine \n\nto attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, \n\nand compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children treated with placebo. The \n\n\n\n6 \n\nprincipal efficacy measurements were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth \n\n(height). The mean white cell cystine level attained during treatment was 1.7 + 0.2 nmol \n\nhemicystine/mg protein. Among cysteamine patients, glomerular function was maintained over time. \n\nPlacebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Patients on \n\ntreatment maintained growth as compared to untreated patients. However, growth velocity did not \n\nincrease enough to allow patients to catch up the normal for their age. Renal tubular function was not \n\naffected by treatment. Two other studies have shown similar results. \n\n \n\nIn all studies, patient response was better when treatment was started at an early age with good renal \n\nfunction. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral dose of cysteamine bitartrate equivalent to 1.05 g of cysteamine free base in \n\nhealthy volunteers, the mean (\uf0b1 sd) values for the time to peak and peak plasma concentration are 1.4 \n\n(\uf0b1 0.5) hours and 4.0 (\uf0b1 1.0) \u00b5g/ml, respectively. In patients at steady state, these values are 1.4 (\uf0b1 0.4) \n\nhours and 2.6 (\uf0b1 0.9) \u00b5g/ml, respectively, after a dose ranging from 225 to 550 mg. \n\nCysteamine bitartrate (CYSTAGON) is bioequivalent to cysteamine hydrochloride and \n\nphosphocysteamine. \n\n \n\nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, which is mostly to albumin, is independent of \n\nplasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range, with a mean (\uf0b1 sd) value of 54.1 % (\uf0b1 1.5). The \n\nplasma protein binding in patients at steady state is similar: 53.1 % (\uf0b1 3.6) and 51.1 % (\uf0b1 4.5) at 1.5 \n\nand 6 hours post-dose, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study performed in 24 healthy volunteers for 24 hours, the mean estimate (\uf0b1 sd) \n\nfor the terminal half-life of elimination was 4.8 (\uf0b1 1.8) hours. \n\n \n\nThe elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3 % and \n\n1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. \n\n \n\nVery limited data suggest that cysteamine pharmacokinetic parameters may not be significantly \n\nmodified in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. No information is available for patients \n\nwith severe renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies have been performed: although in published studies using cysteamine, induction \n\nof chromosome aberrations in cultured eukaryotic cell lines has been reported, specific studies with \n\ncysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in \n\nthe mouse micronucleus test.  \n\n \n\nReproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in \n\nrats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic \n\neffects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis \n\nat a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  \n\nThis is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical \n\nmaintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/ m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at \n\n375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival \n\nof the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of \n\nlactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. \n\nAdministration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. \n\nHigh doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice \n\nbut not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in \n\nseveral animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.  \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenic studies have been conducted with CYSTAGON. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n6.

Frequencies are \n\ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u22651/100 to \uf03c1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriouness \n\n \n\nInvestigations Common: Liver function tests abnormal \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Uncommon: Leukopenia \n\nNervous system disorders Common: Headache, encephalopathy \n\nUncommon: Somnolence, convulsions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea \n\nCommon: Abdominal pain, breath odour, dyspepsia, \n\ngastroenteritis \n\nUncommon: Gastrointestinal ulcer \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon: Nephrotic syndrome \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: Skin odour abnormal, rash \n\nUncommon: Hair colour changes, skin striae, skin \n\nfragility (molluscoid pseudotumor on elbows) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Joint hyperextension, leg pain, genu \n\nvalgum, osteopenia, compression fracture, scoliosis. \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common: Anorexia \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nVery  common: Lethargy, pyrexia \n\nCommon: Asthenia \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon: Anaphylactic reaction \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Uncommon: Nervousness, hallucination \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nCases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with progressive \n\nrecovery after treatment discontinuation. In some cases, histology showed a membranous \n\nglomerulonephritis of the renal allograft and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis. \n\n \n\nCases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in \n\nchildren chronically treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine \n\nchlorhydrate or cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. \n\nIn some cases, these skin lesions were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone \n\nlesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain \n\nand hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression fractures, and scoliosis. \n\nIn cases where histopathological examination of the skin was performed, the results suggested \n\nangioendotheliomatosis. \n\nOne patient subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy.  \n\nIn some the patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed after CYSTAGON dose reduction. \n\nCysteamine mechanism of action by interfering with the cross-linking of collagen fibers has been \n\npostulated (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nAn overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. \n\n \n\nShould overdosage occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported \n\nappropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by \n\nhaemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Alimentary tract and metabolism product, ATC code: A16AA04.  \n\n \n\nNormal individuals and heterozygous subjects for cystinosis have white cell cystine levels of < 0.2, \n\nand usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively. Individuals with nephropathic \n\ncystinosis have elevations of white cell cystine above 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein \n\n \n\nCysteamine reacts with cystine to form the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine. \n\n The mixed disulfide is then exported from the lysosomes by an intact lysine transport system. The \n\ndecrease in leucocyte cystine levels is correlated to the cysteamine plasma concentration over the six \n\nhours following the administration of CYSTAGON.  \n\n \n\nThe leucocyte cystine level reaches its minimum (mean (\uf0b1 sd) value: 1.8 \uf0b1 0.8 hours) slightly later \n\nthan the peak plasma cysteamine concentration (mean (\uf0b1 sd) value: 1.4 \uf0b1 0.4 hours) and returns to its \n\nbaseline level as the plasma cysteamine concentration decreases at 6 hours post-dose. \n\n \n\nIn one clinical study, baseline white cell cystine levels were 3.73 (range 0.13 to 19.8) nmol \n\nhemicystine/mg protein and were maintained close to 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein with a \n\ncysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/m2/day.  \n\nAn earlier study treated 94 children with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine \n\nto attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, \n\nand compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children treated with placebo. The \n\n\n\n13 \n\nprincipal efficacy measurements were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth \n\n(height). The mean white cell cystine level attained during treatment was 1.7 + 0.2 nmol \n\nhemicystine/mg protein. Among cysteamine patients, glomerular function was maintained over time. \n\nPlacebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Patients on \n\ntreatment maintained growth as compared to untreated patients. However, growth velocity did not \n\nincrease enough to allow patients to catch up the normal for their age. Renal tubular function was not \n\naffected by treatment. Two other studies have shown similar results. \n\n \n\nIn all studies, patient response was better when treatment was started at an early age with good renal \n\nfunction. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral dose of cysteamine bitartrate equivalent to 1.05 g of cysteamine free base in \n\nhealthy volunteers, the mean (\uf0b1 sd) values for the time to peak and peak plasma concentration are 1.4 \n\n(\uf0b1 0.5) hours and 4.0 (\uf0b1 1.0) \u00b5g/ml, respectively. In patients at steady state, these values are 1.4 (\uf0b1 0.4) \n\nhours and 2.6 (\uf0b1 0.9) \u00b5g/ml, respectively, after a dose ranging from 225 to 550 mg. \n\nCysteamine bitartrate (CYSTAGON) is bioequivalent to cysteamine hydrochloride and \n\nphosphocysteamine. \n\n \n\nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, which is mostly to albumin, is independent of \n\nplasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range, with a mean (\uf0b1 sd) value of 54.1 % (\uf0b1 1.5). The \n\nplasma protein binding in patients at steady state is similar: 53.1 % (\uf0b1 3.6) and 51.1 % (\uf0b1 4.5) at 1.5 \n\nand 6 hours post-dose, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study performed in 24 healthy volunteers for 24 hours, the mean estimate (\uf0b1 sd) \n\nfor the terminal half-life of elimination was 4.8 (\uf0b1 1.8) hours. \n\n \n\nThe elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3 % and \n\n1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. \n\n \n\nVery limited data suggest that cysteamine pharmacokinetic parameters may not be significantly \n\nmodified in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. No information is available for patients \n\nwith severe renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies have been performed: although in published studies using cysteamine, induction \n\nof chromosome aberrations in cultured eukaryotic cell lines has been reported, specific studies with \n\ncysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in \n\nthe mouse micronucleus test.  \n\n \n\nReproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in \n\nrats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic \n\neffects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis \n\nat a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  \n\nThis is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical \n\nmaintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/ m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at \n\n375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival \n\nof the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of \n\nlactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. \n\nAdministration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. \n\nHigh doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice \n\nbut not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in \n\nseveral animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.  \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenic studies have been conducted with CYSTAGON. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n6.

WHAT CYSTAGON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \n\nCystinosis is a metabolic disease called \u2018nephropathic cystinosis\u2019 which is characterized by an \n\nabnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the body such as the kidney, \n\neye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build up causes kidney damage and excretion of excess \n\namounts of glucose, proteins and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at different ages. \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON is prescribed to manage this rare inherited disorder. CYSTAGON is a medicine that \n\nreacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU USE CYSTAGON \n \n\nDo not use CYSTAGON \n- if you -or your child- are allergic (hypersensitive) to cysteamine bitartrate or penicillamine or \n\nany of the other ingredients of Cystagon. \n\n- If you are pregnant, this is particularly relevant during the first trimester \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \n\nTake special care with CYSTAGON \n- When your or your child\u2019s disorder has been confirmed by leucocyte cystine measurements, the \n\ntherapy with CYSTAGON must be started as soon as possible. \n\n- A few cases of skin lesions on elbows like little hard lumps have been reported in children \ntreated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations. These lesions were associated with \n\nskin striae and bone lesions such as fracture and bone deformities, and with laxity of joints. \n\nYour doctor could require a regular physical and X-ray examination for the skin and the bones \n\nto control the effects of the medicinal product. Self examination of your or your child\u2019s skin is \n\nrecommended. If any skin or bone abnormalities appear, please inform your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n- Your doctor could require controlling the blood cell count on a regular basis. \n- CYSTAGON has not been shown to prevent cystine crystals accumulating in the eye. Where \n\ncysteamine ophthalmic solution has been used for that purpose, its usage should continue. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- In contrast to phosphocysteamine, another active substance close to cysteamine bitartrate, \nCYSTAGON does not contain phosphate. You may already be receiving phosphate supplements \n\nand the dose of these may need to be changed when CYSTAGON is substituted for \n\nphosphocysteamine. \n\n- To avoid any risk of aspiration in the lungs, the capsules should not be given to children under \nthe age of approximately 6 years. \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\neven those not prescribed. \n\n \n\nUsing CYSTAGON with food and drink \nFor children under approximately six years of age, the hard capsule may be opened and the contents \n\nsprinkled on food (e.g. milk, potatoes or starch based foods) or mixed in formula. Do not add to acidic \n\ndrinks e.g. orange juice. Consult the doctor for complete directions. \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \nYou should not use CYSTAGON if you are pregnant. Please consult your doctor if you plan to \n\nbecome pregnant. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nCYSTAGON must not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines  \n\nCYSTAGON may cause some drowsiness. When starting therapy, you or your child should not \n\nengage in potentially hazardous activities until the effects of the drug are well known. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW TO USE CYSTAGON \n \n\nAlways use CYSTAGON exactly as your doctor or your  child\u2019s doctor  has told you. You should \n\ncheck with your doctor if you are not sure. \n\nThe dose of CYSTAGON prescribed for you or your child will depend on your or your child's age and \n\nweight.  \n\nFor children up to age 12 years, the dose will be based on the body size (surface area), the usual dose \n\nbeing 1.30 g/m2 of body surface area per day.  \n\nFor patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the usual dose is 2g/day. \n\nIn any case the usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day. \n\nCYSTAGON should be taken or given only by mouth and exactly as your or your child's doctor \n\ndirects. In order for CYSTAGON to work correctly, you must do the following: \n\n- Follow your doctor's directions exactly. Do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine \nwithout your doctor's approval. \n\n- Hard capsules should not be given to children under approximately six years of age because \nthey may not be able to swallow them and they may choke. For children under approximately \n\nsix years of age, the hard capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food (e.g. milk, \n\npotatoes or starch based foods) or mixed in formula. Do not add to acidic drinks e.g. orange \n\njuice. Consult the doctor for complete directions. \n\n- Your or your child's medical treatment may include, in addition to CYSTAGON, one or more \nsupplements to replace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. It is important to take or \n\ngive these supplements exactly as instructed. If several doses of the supplements are missed or \n\nweakness or drowsiness develops, call the doctor for instructions. \n\n- Regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells are necessary to \nhelp determine the correct dose of CYSTAGON. Your or your child's doctor will arrange for the \n\nblood tests to be done. Regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of the body's \n\nimportant electrolytes are also necessary to help your or your child's doctor correctly adjust the \n\ndoses of these supplements. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nCYSTAGON should be taken 4 times a day, every 6 hours, preferably just after or with food. It is \n\nimportant to take the dose as close to every 6 hours as possible. \n\n \n\nTreatment with CYSTAGON should continue indefinitely, as instructed by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you use more CYSTAGON than you should: \n\nYou should contact your or your child's doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if \n\nmore medicine has been taken than has been prescribed, drowsiness develops . \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take CYSTAGON: \n\nIf a dose of medicine is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. However if it is within two \n\nhours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not take a \n\ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \n\nLike all medicines, CYSTAGON can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nCYSTAGON may cause some people to become drowsy or less vigilant than they are normally. Make \n\nsure you know how you or your child reacts to this medicine before doing anything that could be \n\ndangerous if not alert. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects were reported as follows: very common (occurring in at least one in 10 \n\npatients), common (occurring in at least one in 100 patients), uncommon (occurring in at least one \n\nin1,000 patients), rare (occurring in at least one in 10,000 patients), very rare (occurring in at least one \n\nin 100,000 patients). \n\n \n\n- Very common: vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, fever and sensation of sleep \n\n \n\n- Common: abdominal pain or discomfort, unpleasant breath and body odour, skin eruption, \n\ngastroenteritis, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy (brain disorder) and liver function test \n\nabnormalities. \n\n \n\n-  Uncommon: skin striae, skin lesion (little-hard lumps on elbows), joint laxity, leg pain, bone \n\nfracture, scoliosis (deviation of the vertebral column), bone deformity and fragility, hair \n\ndiscoloration, severe allergic reaction, somnolence, fits, nervousness, hallucination, decrease in \n\nwhite blood cells, gastrointestinal ulcer manifested by bleeding in the digestive tract and effect \n\non the kidney manifested by swelling of the extremities and weight gain. \n\nSince some of these side effects are serious, ask your or your child\u2019s doctor to explain their warning \n\nsigns. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

child's doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor if you are not sure. the dose of cystagon prescribed for you or your child will depend on your or your child's age and weight. for children up to age 12 years, the dose will be based on the body size (surface area), the usual dose being 1.30 g/m2 of body surface area per day. for patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the usual dose is 2g/day. in any case the usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day. cystagon should be taken or given only by mouth and exactly as your or your child's doctor directs. in order for cystagon to work correctly, you must do the following: - follow your doctor's directions exactly. do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine without your doctor's approval. - hard capsules should not be given to children under approximately six years of age because they may not be able to swallow them and they may choke. for children under approximately six years of age, the hard capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food (e.g. milk, potatoes or starch based foods) or mixed in formula. do not add to acidic drinks e.g. orange juice. consult the doctor for complete directions. - your or your child's medical treatment may include, in addition to cystagon, one or more supplements to replace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. it is important to take or give these supplements exactly as instructed. if several doses of the supplements are missed or weakness or drowsiness develops, call the doctor for instructions. - regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells are necessary to help determine the correct dose of cystagon. your or your child's doctor will arrange for the blood tests to be done. regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of the body's important electrolytes are also necessary to help your or your child's doctor correctly adjust the doses of these supplements. cystagon should be taken 4 times a day, every 6 hours, preferably just after or with food. it is important to take the dose as close to every 6 hours as possible. treatment with cystagon should continue indefinitely, as instructed by your doctor. if you use more cystagon than you should: you should contact your or your child's doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if more medicine has been taken than has been prescribed, drowsiness develops . if you forget to take cystagon: if a dose of medicine is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. however if it is within two hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "cystagon", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
