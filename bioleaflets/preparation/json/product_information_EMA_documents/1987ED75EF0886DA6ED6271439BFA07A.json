The recommended dose of Zirabev is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every \n3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n\nTreatment of platinum-resistant recurrent disease: Zirabev is administered in combination with one of \nthe following agents – topotecan (given weekly) or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The \nrecommended dose of Zirabev is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an intravenous\ninfusion. When Zirabev is administered in combination with topotecan (given on days 1-5, every 3 \nweeks), the recommended dose of Zirabev is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. It is recommended that treatment be continued until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1, study MO22224).\n\nCervical cancer\n\nZirabev is administered in combination with one of the following chemotherapy regimens: paclitaxel \nand cisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan.\n\nThe recommended dose of Zirabev is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion.\n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nThe safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\n\n\n5\n\nThere is no relevant use of bevacizumab in the paediatric population in the indications for treatment \nof cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, cervix and kidney.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nZirabev is for intravenous use. The initial dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous \ninfusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated, the second infusion may be administered over \n60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered \nover 30 minutes.\n\nIt should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.\n\nDose reduction for adverse reactions is not recommended. If indicated, therapy should either be \npermanently discontinued or temporarily suspended as described in section 4.4.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product\n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Zirabev\ninfusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions. This medicinal product must \nnot be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Hypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products or other recombinant \n\nhuman or humanised antibodies.\n Pregnancy (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulae (see section 4.8)\n\nPatients may be at an increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and gall \nbladder perforation when treated with bevacizumab. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process may be a \nrisk factor for gastrointestinal perforations in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or \nrectum, therefore, caution should be exercised when treating these patients. Prior radiation is a risk \nfactor for GI perforation in patients treated for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with \nbevacizumab and all patients with GI perforation had a history of prior radiation. Therapy should be \npermanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation.\n\nGI-vaginal fistulae in study GOG-0240\n\nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab are at \nincreased risk of fistulae between the vagina and any part of the GI tract (Gastrointestinal-vaginal \nfistulae). Prior radiation is a major risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae and all \npatients with GI- vaginal fistulae had a history of prior radiation. Recurrence of cancer within the field \nof prior radiation is an additional important risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae.\n\nNon-GI fistulae (see section 4.8)\n\nPatients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with bevacizumab. \nPermanently discontinue Zirabev in patients with tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula or any Grade 4 \nfistula [US National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \n\n\n\n6\n\n(NCI-CTCAE v.3)]. Limited information is available on the continued use of bevacizumab in patients\nwith other fistulae.\n\nIn cases of internal fistula not arising in the gastrointestinal tract, discontinuation of Zirabev should be \nconsidered.\n\nWound healing complications (see section 4.8)\n\nBevacizumab may adversely affect the wound healing process. Serious wound healing complications, \nincluding anastomotic complications, with a fatal outcome have been reported. Therapy should not be \ninitiated for at least 28 days following major surgery or until the surgical wound is fully healed. In \npatients who experienced wound healing complications during therapy, treatment should be withheld \nuntil the wound is fully healed. Therapy should be withheld for elective surgery.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with\nbevacizumab. This condition is usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal\nperforation or fistula formation. Zirabev therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop \nnecrotising fasciitis, and appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated.\n\nHypertension (see section 4.8)\n\nAn increased incidence of hypertension was observed in bevacizumab-treated patients. Clinical \nsafety data suggest that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. Pre-existing \nhypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zirabev treatment. There is no \ninformation on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of \ninitiating therapy.\n\nMonitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy.\n\nIn most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment \nappropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage \nhypertension is not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. Zirabev\nshould be permanently discontinued if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately \ncontrolled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive \nencephalopathy.\n\nAneurysms and artery dissections\n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Zirabev, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm.\n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (see section 4.8)\n\nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurologic disorder, which can present with the following signs and\nsymptoms among others: seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical \nblindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by \nbrain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients developing PRES, \ntreatment of specific symptoms including control of hypertension is recommended along with \ndiscontinuation of Zirabev. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously \nexperiencing PRES is not known.\n\nProteinuria (see section 4.8)\n\nPatients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria \nwhen treated with bevacizumab. There is evidence suggesting that all Grade (US National Cancer \nInstitute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE v.3]) proteinuria may be \nrelated to the dose. Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting \n\n\n\n7\n\nand during therapy. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4% of patients \ntreated with bevacizumab. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop \nnephrotic syndrome (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nArterial thromboembolism (see section 4.8)\n\nIn clinical trials, the incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions including cerebrovascular \naccidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in\npatients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those who received \nchemotherapy alone.\n\nPatients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, with a history of arterial thromboembolism, \ndiabetes or age greater than 65 years have an increased risk of developing arterial thromboembolic \nreactions during therapy. Caution should be taken when treating these patients with Zirabev.\n\nTherapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop arterial thromboembolic \nreactions.\n\nVenous thromboembolism (see section 4.8)\n\nPatients may be at risk of developing venous thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary \nembolism under bevacizumab treatment.\n\nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab in \ncombination with paclitaxel and cisplatin may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events.\n\nZirabev should be discontinued in patients with life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, \nincluding pulmonary embolism (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Patients with thromboembolic reactions ≤ Grade 3 \nneed to be closely monitored (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nHaemorrhage\n\nPatients treated with bevacizumab have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially \ntumour-associated haemorrhage. Zirabev should be discontinued permanently in patients who \nexperience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding during Zirabev therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with \nbevacizumab, based on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS \nhaemorrhage in such patients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials (see\nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Zirabev\ntreatment discontinued in cases of intracranial bleeding.\n\nThere is no information on the safety profile of bevacizumab in patients with congenital bleeding \ndiathesis, acquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment \nof thromboembolism prior to starting bevacizumab treatment, as such patients were excluded from \nclinical trials. Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating therapy in these patients. \nHowever, patients who developed venous thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to have \nan increased rate of Grade 3 or above bleeding when treated with a full dose of warfarin and \nbevacizumab concomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nPulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis\n\nPatients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab may be at risk of serious, and in \nsome cases fatal, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis. Patients with recent pulmonary \nhaemorrhage/haemoptysis (> 2.5 ml of red blood) should not be treated with Zirabev.\n\n\n\n8\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8)\n\nReactions consistent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from \nasymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or \nhospitalisation. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant \ncardiovascular disease such as pre-existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with \nZirabev.\n\nMost of the patients who experienced CHF had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF \nwere present.\n\nIn patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with anthracyclines and who had not received \nanthracyclines before, no increased incidence of all Grade CHF was observed in the \nanthracycline + bevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF Grade 3 \nor higher reactions were somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in \ncombination with chemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent \nwith results in patients in other studies of metastatic breast cancer who did not receive concurrent \nanthracycline treatment (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8).\n\nNeutropenia and infections (see section 4.8)\n\nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic \nchemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone. This has mainly \nbeen seen in combination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC, mBC, \nand in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.8)\n\nPatients may be at risk of developing infusion/hypersensitivity reactions. Close observation of the \npatient during and following the administration of bevacizumab is recommended as expected for any \ninfusion of a therapeutic humanised monoclonal antibody. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapies should be administered. A systematic premedication \nis not warranted.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (see section 4.8)\n\nCases of ONJ have been reported in cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, the majority of whom \nhad received prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for which ONJ is an \nidentified risk. Caution should be exercised when Zirabev and intravenous bisphosphonates are \nadministered simultaneously or sequentially.\n\nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate \npreventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with Zirabev. In patients who \nhave previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates invasive dental procedures \nshould be avoided, if possible.\n\nIntravitreal use\n\nZirabev is not formulated for intravitreal use.\n\nEye disorders\n\nIndividual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following \nunapproved intravitreal use of bevacizumab compounded from vials approved for intravenous \nadministration in cancer patients. These reactions included infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular \ninflammation such as sterile endophthalmitis, uveitis and vitritis, retinal detachment, retinal pigment \nepithelial tear, intraocular pressure increased, intraocular haemorrhage such as vitreous haemorrhage \n\n\n\n9\n\nor retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival haemorrhage. Some of these reactions have resulted in \nvarious degrees of visual loss, including permanent blindness.\n\nSystemic effects following intravitreal use\n\nA reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal \nanti-VEGF therapy. Systemic adverse reactions including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial \nthromboembolic reactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors.\n\nOvarian failure/fertility\n\nBevacizumab may impair female fertility (see sections 4.6 and 4.8). Therefore fertility preservation \nstrategies should be discussed with women of child-bearing potential prior to starting treatment with \nZirabev.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of antineoplastic agents on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics\n\nNo clinically relevant interaction of co-administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab \npharmacokinetics was observed based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. There \nwere neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant differences in bevacizumab clearance in \npatients receiving bevacizumab monotherapy compared to patients receiving bevacizumab in \ncombination with interferon alfa-2a, erlotinib or chemotherapies (IFL, 5-FU/LV, \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, doxorubicin or cisplatin/gemcitabine).\n\nEffect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents\n\nNo clinically relevant interaction of bevacizumab was observed on the pharmacokinetics of \nco-administered interferon alpha 2a, erlotinib (and its active metabolite OSI-420), or the \nchemotherapies irinotecan (and its active metabolite SN38), capecitabine, oxaliplatin (as determined \nby measurement of free and total platinum), and cisplatin. Conclusions on the impact of \nbevacizumab on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn.\n\nCombination of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate\n\nIn two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \n(MAHA) was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks) \nand sunitinib malate (50 mg daily) combination.\n\nMAHA is a haemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anaemia, and \nthrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and \nneurological symptoms were observed in some of these patients. All of these findings were reversible \nupon discontinuation of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate (see Hypertension, Proteinuria, PRES in \nsection 4.4).\n\nCombination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8)\n\nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with platinum-\nor taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC and mBC.\n\nRadiotherapy\n\nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of radiotherapy and bevacizumab has not been \nestablished.\n\n\n\n10\n\nEGFR monoclonal antibodies in combination with bevacizumab chemotherapy regimens\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. EGFR monoclonal antibodies should not be \nadministered for the treatment of mCRC in combination with bevacizumab-containing \nchemotherapy. Results from the randomised phase III studies, PACCE and CAIRO-2, in patients \nwith mCRC suggest that the use of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab, \nrespectively, in combination with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased PFS \nand/or OS, and with increased toxicity compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy alone.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 6 months after) \ntreatment.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no clinical trial data on the use of bevacizumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are known to cross \nthe placenta, and bevacizumab is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the foetus, and thus is \nsuspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. In the post-marketing \nsetting, cases of foetal abnormalities in women treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination \nwith known embryotoxic chemotherapeutics have been observed (see section 4.8). Bevacizumab is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk. As maternal IgG is excreted in milk \nand bevacizumab could harm infant growth and development (see section 5.3), women must\ndiscontinue breast-feeding during therapy and not breast-feed for at least six months following the last \ndose of bevacizumab.\n\nFertility\n\nRepeat dose toxicity studies in animals have shown that bevacizumab may have an adverse effect on \nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). In a phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon \ncancer, a substudy with premenopausal women has shown a higher incidence of new cases of ovarian \nfailure in the bevacizumab group compared to the control group. After discontinuation of \nbevacizumab treatment, ovarian function recovered in the majority of patients. Long term effects of \nthe treatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBevacizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nsomnolence and syncope have been reported with bevacizumab use (see table 1 in section 4.8). If \npatients are experiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, \nthey should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall safety profile of bevacizumab is based on data from over 5,700 patients with various \nmalignancies, predominantly treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in clinical \ntrials.\n\nThe most serious adverse reactions were:\n\n\n\n11\n\n Gastrointestinal perforations (see section 4.4).\n Haemorrhage, including pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, which is more common in \n\nnon- small cell lung cancer patients (see section 4.4).\n Arterial thromboembolism (see section 4.4).\n\nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving \nbevacizumab were hypertension, fatigue or asthenia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.\n\nAnalyses of the clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria with \nbevacizumab therapy are likely to be dose-dependent.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in this section fall into the following frequency categories: Very common \n(≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); \nvery rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTables 1 and 2 list adverse reactions associated with the use of bevacizumab in combination with \ndifferent chemotherapy regimens in multiple indications.\n\nTable 1 provides all adverse reactions by frequency that were determined to have a causal relationship \nwith bevacizumab through:\n comparative incidences noted between clinical trial treatment arms (with at least a \n\n10% difference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 1-5 reactions or at least a \n2% difference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 reactions,\n\n post-authorisation safety studies,\n spontaneous reporting,\n epidemiological studies\\non-interventional or observational studies,\n or through an evaluation of individual case reports.\n\nTable 2 provides the frequency of severe adverse reactions. Severe reactions are defined as adverse \nreactions with at least a 2% difference compared to the control arm in clinical studies for \nNCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 reactions. Table 2 also includes adverse reactions which are considered by \nthe MAH to be clinically significant or severe.\n\nPost-marketing adverse reactions are included in both Tables 1 and 2, where applicable. Detailed \ninformation about these post-marketing reactions are provided in Table 3.\n\nAdverse reactions are added to the appropriate frequency category in the tables below according \nto the highest incidence seen in any indication.\n\nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nSome of the adverse reactions are reactions commonly seen with chemotherapy; however, \nbevacizumab may exacerbate these reactions when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. \nExamples include palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome with pegylated liposomal \ndoxorubicin or capecitabine, peripheral sensory neuropathy with paclitaxel or oxaliplatin, nail \ndisorders or alopecia with paclitaxel, and paronychia with erlotinib.\n\n\n\n12\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions by frequency\n\nSystem organ\nclass\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare Frequency not \nknown\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nSepsis, Abscessb,d, \nCellulitis, \nInfection, Urinary \ntract infection\n\nNecrotising \nfasciitisa\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nFebrile \nneutropenia, \nLeucopenia, \nNeutropeniab, \nThrombo-cytopenia\n\nAnaemia, \nLymphopenia\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity, \nInfusion \nreactionsa,b,d\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nAnorexia,\nHypomagnesaemia,\nHyponatraemia\n\nDehydration\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathyb, \nDysarthria, \nHeadache, \nDysguesia\n\nCerebrovascular \naccident, Syncope, \nSomnolence\n\nPosterior \nreversible \nencephalo-\npathy \nsyndromea,b,d\n\nHypertensive \nencephalo-\npathya\n\nEye disorders Eye disorder, \nLacrimation \nincreased\n\nCardiac disorders Congestive heart \nfailureb,d, \nSupraventricular \ntachycardia\n\nVascular disorders Hypertensionb,d, \nThrombo-embolism \n(venous)b,d\n\nThrombo-\nembolism \n(arterial)b,d, \nHaemorrhageb,d, \nDeep vein \nthrombosis\n\nAneurysms and \nartery dissections,\nRenal thrombotic\nmicroangiopathya,b\n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea, Rhinitis,\nEpistaxis, Cough\n\nPulmonary \nhaemorrhage/ \nHaemoptysisb,d, \nPulmonary \nembolism, \nHypoxia, \nDysphoniaa\n\nPulmonary \nhypertensiona, \nNasal septum \nperforationa\n\n\n\n13\n\nSystem organ\nclass\n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare Frequency not \nknown\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nRectal \nhaemorrhage, \nStomatitis, \nConstipation, \nDiarrhoea, Nausea, \nVomiting, \nAbdominal pain\n\nGastrointestinal \nperforationb,d, \nIntestinal \nperforation, Ileus,\nIntestinal \nobstruction, \nRecto-vaginal \nfistulaed,e, \nGastrointestinal \ndisorder, \nProctalgia\n\nGastrointestinal \nulcera\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nGallbladder \nperforationa,b\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nWound healing \ncomplicationsb,d, \nExfoliative \ndermatitis, Dry \nskin, Skin \ndiscoloration\n\nPalmar-plantar \nerythro-\ndysaesthesia \nsyndrome\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nArthralgia,\nMyalgia\n\nFistulab,d, \nMuscular \nweakness, Back \npain\n\nOsteonecrosis of \nthe jawa,b,\nNon-mandibular \nosteonecrosisa,f\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nProteinuriab,d\n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders\n\nOvarian \nfailureb,c,d\n\nPelvic pain\n\nCongenital, familial, \nand genetic disorder\n\nFoetal \nabnormalitiesa,b\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nAsthenia, Fatigue, \nPyrexia, Pain, \nMucosal \ninflammation\n\nLethargy\n\nInvestigations Weight decreased\n\nWhen events were noted as both all grade and grade 3-5 adverse drug reactions in clinical trials, the \nhighest frequency observed in patients has been reported.

Table \n2 also includes clinically significant adverse reactions that were observed only in the postmarketing setting, \ntherefore, the frequency and NCI-CTCAE grade is not known. These clinically significant reactions have \ntherefore been included in Table 2 within the column entitled “Frequency Not Known.”\n\na Terms represent a group of events that describe a medical concept rather than a single condition or \nMedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) preferred term. This group of medical terms \nmay involve the same underlying pathophysiology (e.g. arterial thromboembolic reactions include \ncerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack and other arterial \nthromboembolic reactions).\n\nb For additional information refer below within section “Further information on selected serious adverse \nreactions”\n\nc For further information please refer to Table 3 ‘Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting.’\nd Recto-vaginal fistulae are the most common fistulae in the GI-vaginal fistula category.\n\nDescription of selected serious adverse reactions\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulae (see section 4.4)\n\nBevacizumab has been associated with serious cases of gastrointestinal perforation.\n\nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1% in \npatients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, up to 1.3% in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer, up to 2.0% in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or in patients with ovarian cancer, \nand up to 2.7% (including gastrointestinal fistula and abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal \ncancer. From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), GI perforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history \nof prior pelvic radiation. The occurrence of those events varied in type and severity, ranging from \nfree air seen on the plain abdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal \nperforation with abdominal abscess and fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal \ninflammation was present, either from gastric ulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or \nchemotherapy-associated colitis.\n\nFatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, \nwhich represents between 0.2%-1% of all bevacizumab treated patients.\n\n\n\n16\n\nIn bevacizumab clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an \nincidence of up to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were \nalso reported less commonly in patients with other types of cancer.\n\nGI-vaginal fistulae in study GOG-0240\n\nIn a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of \nGI-vaginal fistulae was 8.3% in bevacizumab-treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of \nwhom had a history of prior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group \ntreated with bevacizumab + chemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of \nprior radiation (16.7%) compared with patients with no prior radiation and/ or no recurrence inside \nthe field of prior radiation (3.6%). The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving \nchemotherapy alone were 1.1% vs. 0.8%, respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may \nalso have bowel obstructions and require surgical intervention as well as diverting ostomies.\n\nNon-GI fistulae (see section 4.4)\n\nBevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in \ndeath.\n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG-240), \n1.8% of bevacizumab-treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had non-\ngastrointestinal vaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae.\n\nUncommon (≥ 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the \ngastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various \nindications. Fistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience.\n\nReactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater \nthan 1 year from initiation of bevacizumab, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months \nof therapy.\n\nWound healing (see section 4.4)\n\nAs bevacizumab may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within \nthe last 28 days were excluded from participation in phase III clinical trials.\n\nIn clinical trials of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, there was no increased risk of \npost-operative bleeding or wound healing complications observed in patients who underwent major \nsurgery 28-60 days prior to starting bevacizumab. An increased incidence of post-operative bleeding \nor wound healing complication occurring within 60 days of major surgery was observed if the patient \nwas being treated with bevacizumab at the time of surgery. The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) \nand 20% (3/15).\n\nSerious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, have been reported, \nsome of which had a fatal outcome.\n\nIn locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer trials, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were \nobserved in up to 1.1% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared with up to 0.9% of patients in \nthe control arms (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nIn clinical trials of ovarian cancer, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were observed in up to \n1.8% of patients in the bevacizumab arm versus 0.1% in the control arm (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nHypertension (see section 4.4)\n\nIn clinical trials, with the exception of study JO25567, the overall incidence of hypertension (all \ngrades) ranged up to 42.1% in the bevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 14% in the \ncontrol arms. The overall incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 hypertension in patients receiving \n\n\n\n17\n\nbevacizumab ranged from 0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) occurred in up \nto 1.0% of patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy compared to up to 0.2% of patients \ntreated with the same chemotherapy alone.\n\nIn study JO25567, all grade hypertension was observed in 77.3% of the patients who received \nbevacizumab in combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with \nEGFR activating mutations, compared to 14.3% of patients treated with erlotinib alone. Grade 3 \nhypertension was 60.0% in patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib \ncompared to 11.7% in patients treated with erlotinib alone. There were no grade 4 or 5 hypertension \nevents.\n\nHypertension was generally adequately controlled with oral anti-hypertensives such as\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and calcium-channel blockers. It rarely resulted in \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment or hospitalisation.\n\nVery rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported, some of which were fatal.\n\nThe risk of bevacizumab-associated hypertension did not correlate with the patients’ baseline \ncharacteristics, underlying disease or concomitant therapy.\n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see section 4.4)\n\nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurological disorder. Presentation may include seizures, headache, \naltered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated \nhypertension. The clinical presentation of PRES is often nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of \nPRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI.\n\nIn patients developing PRES, early recognition of symptoms with prompt treatment of specific \nsymptoms including control of hypertension (if associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension) is \nrecommended in addition to discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. Symptoms usually resolve or \nimprove within days after treatment discontinuation, although some patients have experienced some \nneurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously \nexperiencing PRES is not known.\n\nAcross clinical trials, 8 cases of PRES have been reported. Two of the eight cases did not have \nradiological confirmation via MRI.\n\nProteinuria (see section 4.4)\n\nIn clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 54.7% of patients \nreceiving bevacizumab.\n\nProteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic \nsyndrome, with the great majority as Grade 1 proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Grade 3 proteinuria was \nreported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up \nto 1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to start of Zirabev therapy. \nIn most clinical trials urine protein levels of ≥ 2 g/24 hrs led to the holding of bevacizumab until \nrecovery to < 2 g/24 hrs.\n\nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4)\n\nIn clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-5 bleeding \nreactions ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in bevacizumab treated patients, compared with up to 4.5% of \npatients in the chemotherapy control group.\n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 bleeding reactions have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients \n\n\n\n18\n\ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan.\n\nThe haemorrhagic reactions that have been observed in clinical trials were predominantly \ntumour-associated haemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis).\n\nTumour-associated haemorrhage (see section 4.4)\n\nMajor or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis has been observed primarily in trials in \npatients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Possible risk factors include squamous cell \nhistology, treatment with antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory substances, treatment with anticoagulants, \nprior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumour \nlocation and cavitation of tumours prior to or during therapy. The only variables that showed \nstatistically significant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell \nhistology. Patients with NSCLC of known squamous cell histology or mixed cell type with \npredominant squamous cell histology were excluded from subsequent phase III trials, while patients \nwith unknown tumour histology were included.\n\nIn patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all Grade reactions were seen \nwith a frequency of up to 9.3% when treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with up \nto 5% in the patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Grade 3-5 reactions have been observed in up \nto 2.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as compared with < 1% with \nchemotherapy alone (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Major or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis can \noccur suddenly and up to two thirds of the serious pulmonary haemorrhages resulted in a fatal \noutcome.\n\nGastrointestinal haemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melaena have been reported in \ncolorectal cancer patients, and have been assessed as tumour-associated haemorrhages.\n\nTumour-associated haemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumour types and locations, including \ncases of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in patients with CNS metastases (see section 4.4).\n\nThe incidence of CNS bleeding in patients with untreated CNS metastases receiving bevacizumab has \nnot been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials. In an exploratory retrospective analysis \nof data from 13 completed randomised trials in patients with various tumour types, 3 patients out of \n91 (3.3%) with brain metastases experienced CNS bleeding (all Grade 4) when treated with\nbevacizumab, compared to 1 case (Grade 5) out of 96 patients (1%) that were not exposed to \nbevacizumab. In two subsequent studies in patients with treated brain metastases (which included \naround 800 patients), one case of Grade 2 CNS haemorrhage was reported in 83 subjects treated with \nbevacizumab (1.2%) at the time of interim safety analysis (NCI-CTCAE v.3).\n\nAcross all clinical trials, mucocutaneous haemorrhage has been seen in up to 50% of bevacizumab-\ntreated patients. These were most commonly NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than\n5 minutes, resolved without medical intervention and did not require any changes in the bevacizumab\ntreatment regimen. Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of minor mucocutaneous \nhaemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis) may be dose-dependent.\n\nThere have also been less common reactions of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage in other \nlocations, such as gingival bleeding or vaginal bleeding.\n\nThromboembolism (see section 4.4)\n\nArterial thromboembolism\nAn increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions was observed in patients treated with \nbevacizumab across indications, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient \nischaemic attacks, and other arterial thromboembolic reactions.\n\nIn clinical trials, the overall incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions ranged up to 3.8% in the \nbevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 2.1% in the chemotherapy control arms. Fatal \noutcome was reported in 0.8% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.5% in patients \n\n\n\n19\n\nreceiving chemotherapy alone. Cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischaemic attacks) \nwere reported in up to 2.7% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction was \nreported in up to 1.4% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone.\n\nIn one clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, \nAVF2192g, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with \nirinotecan were included. In this trial arterial thromboembolic reactions were observed in \n11% (11/100) of patients compared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\nThe incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions in clinical trials was similar in patients receiving \nbevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those receiving the control \nchemotherapy alone. Venous thromboembolic reactions include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary \nembolism and thrombophlebitis.\n\nIn clinical trials across indications, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions ranged \nfrom 2.8% to 17.3% of bevacizumab-treated patients compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the control \narms.\n\nGrade 3-5 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) venous thromboembolic reactions have been reported in up to 7.8% of \npatients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy alone (across indications, excluding persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical \ncancer).\n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% of patients \ntreated with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 7.0% of \npatients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin.\n\nPatients who have experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction may be at higher risk for a \nrecurrence if they receive bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy \nalone.\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF)\n\nIn clinical trials with bevacizumab, congestive heart failure (CHF) was observed in all cancer \nindications studied to date, but occurred predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In \nfour phase III trials (AVF2119g, E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer CHF Grade 3 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) or higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For \npatients in study AVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the \nincidences of Grade 3 or higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar \nto those in the other studies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab \narm and 0% in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all \nGrade CHF were similar between the anthracycline + bevacizumab (6.2%) and the \nanthracycline + placebo arms (6.0%).\n\nMost patients who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left \nventricular function following appropriate medical therapy.\n\nIn most clinical trials of bevacizumab, patients with pre-existing CHF of NYHA (New York Heart \nAssociation) II-IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of CHF in this \npopulation.\n\nPrior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiation to the chest wall may be possible risk factors for \nthe development of CHF.\n\n\n\n20\n\nAn increased incidence of CHF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large \nB-cell lymphoma when receiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than\n300 mg/m2. This phase III clinical trial compared\nrituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) plus bevacizumab to \nR-CHOP without bevacizumab. While the incidence of CHF was, in both arms, above that previously \nobserved for doxorubicin therapy, the rate was higher in the R-CHOP plus bevacizumab arm. These \nresults suggest that close clinical observation with appropriate cardiac assessments should be \nconsidered for patients exposed to cumulative doxorubicin doses greater than 300 mg/m2 when \ncombined with bevacizumab.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.4 and Post-marketing experience below)\n\nIn some clinical trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions were reported more frequently \nin patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. \nThe incidence of these reactions in some clinical trials of bevacizumab is common (up to 5% in \nbevacizumab- treated patients).\n\nInfections\n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 infections have been reported in up to 24% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients \ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan.\n\nOvarian failure/fertility (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)\n\nIn NSABP C-08, a phase III trial of bevacizumab in adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, \nthe incidence of new cases of ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, FSH \nlevel ≥ 30 mIU/mL and a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated in \n295 premenopausal women. New cases of ovarian failure were reported in 2.6% patients in the \nmFOLFOX-6 group compared to 39% in the mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab group. After \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment, ovarian function recovered in 86.2% of these evaluable \nwomen. Long term effects of the treatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown.\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\n\nDecreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count and presence of urine protein may be \nassociated with bevacizumab treatment.\n\nAcross clinical trials, the following Grade 3 and 4 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) laboratory abnormalities \noccurred in patients treated with bevacizumab with at least a 2% difference compared to the \ncorresponding control groups: hyperglycaemia, decreased haemoglobin, hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, decreased white blood cell count, increased international normalised ratio (INR).\n\nClinical trials have shown that transient increases in serum creatinine (ranging between \n1.5-1.9 times baseline level), both with and without proteinuria, are associated with the use of \nbevacizumab. The observed increase in serum creatinine was not associated with a higher incidence \nof clinical manifestations of renal impairment in patients treated with bevacizumab.\n\nOther special populations\n\nElderly patients\n\nIn randomised clinical trials, age > 65 years was associated with an increased risk of developing \narterial thromboembolic reactions, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic \nattacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs). Other reactions with a higher frequency seen in \npatients over 65 were Grade 3-4 leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (NCI-CTCAE v.3); and all Grade \nneutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and fatigue as compared to those aged ≤ 65 years when \ntreated with bevacizumab (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 under Thromboembolism). In one clinical trial, \n\n\n\n21\n\nthe incidence of hypertension of grade ≥ 3 was two fold higher in patients aged > 65 years than in the \nyounger age group (<65 years). In a study of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients, \nalopecia, mucosal inflammation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, proteinuria and hypertension were\nalso reported and occurred at a rate at least 5% higher in the CT + BV arm for bevacizumab-treated \npatients ≥ 65 years of age compared with bevacizumab-treated patients aged < 65 years.\n\nNo increase in the incidence of other reactions, including gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing \ncomplications, congestive heart failure, and haemorrhage was observed in elderly patients \n(> 65 years) receiving bevacizumab as compared to those aged ≤ 65 years treated with bevacizumab.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established.\n\nIn study BO25041 of bevacizumab added to postoperative radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant \nand adjuvant temozolomide in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial, infratentorial, \ncerebellar, or peduncular high-grade glioma, the safety profile was comparable with that observed in \nother tumour types in adults treated with bevacizumab.\n\nIn study BO20924 of bevacizumab with current standard of care in rhabdomyosarcoma and \nnon-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, the safety profile of bevacizumab treated children was \ncomparable with that observed in adults treated with bevacizumab.\n\nBevacizumab is not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. In published literature \nreports, cases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of \n18 years treated with bevacizumab.\n\nPost-marketing experience\n\nTable 3 Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting\n\nSystem organ class \n(SOC)\n\nReactions (frequency*)\n\nInfections and \nInfestations\n\nNecrotising fasciitis, usually secondary to wound healing \ncomplications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation (rare) \n(see also section 4.4)\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions (not known); with the \nfollowing possible co-manifestations: dyspnoea/difficulty breathing, \nflushing/redness/rash, hypotension or hypertension, oxygen \ndesaturation, chest pain, rigors and nausea/vomiting (see also section\n4.4 and Hypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions above)\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nHypertensive encephalopathy (very rare) (see also section 4.4 and\nHypertension in section 4.8)\nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), (rare) (see \nalso section 4.4)\n\nVascular disorders Renal thrombotic microangiopathy, which may be clinically \nmanifested as proteinuria (not known) with or without concomitant \nsunitinib use.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, \nother antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C07\n\nZirabev is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis \nand angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and \nKDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF \nregresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the \nformation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nAdministration of bevacizumab or its parental murine antibody to xenotransplant models of cancer in \nnude mice resulted in extensive anti-tumour activity in human cancers, including colon, breast, \n\n\n\n23\n\npancreas and prostate. Metastatic disease progression was inhibited and microvascular permeability\nwas reduced.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC)\n\nThe safety and efficacy of the recommended dose (5 mg/kg of body weight every two weeks) in \nmetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum were studied in three randomised, active-controlled \nclinical trials in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy. \nbevacizumab was combined with two chemotherapy regimens:\n\n AVF2107g: A weekly schedule of irinotecan/bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (IFL) for \na total of 4 weeks of each 6 week-cycle (Saltz regimen).\n\n AVF0780g: In combination with bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) for a total \nof 6 weeks of each 8 week-cycle (Roswell Park regimen).\n\n AVF2192g: In combination with bolus 5-FU/FA for a total of 6 weeks of each \n8 week-cycle (Roswell Park regimen) in patients who were not optimal candidates for \nfirst-line irinotecan treatment.\n\nThree additional studies with bevacizumab have been conducted in mCRC patients: first-line \n(NO16966), second-line with no previous bevacizumab treatment (E3200), and second-line \nwith previous bevacizumab treatment following disease progression in first-line (ML18147). In \nthese studies, bevacizumab was administered at the following dosing regimens in combination \nwith FOLFOX-4 (5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin), XELOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin), and \nfluoropyrimidine/irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin:\n\n NO16966: Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks in combination with \noral capecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin (XELOX) or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every \n2 weeks in combination with leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by \n5-fluorouracil infusion, with intravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4).\n\n E3200: Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks in combination with \nleucovorin and 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with \nintravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) in bevacizumab-naïve patients.\n\n ML18147: Bevacizumab 5.0 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks or bevacizumab\n7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks in combination with \nfluoropyrimidine/irinotecan or fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin in patients with disease \nprogression following first-line treatment with bevacizumab. Use of irinotecan- or \noxaliplatin-containing regimen was switched depending on first-line usage of either \noxaliplatin or irinotecan.\n\nAVF2107g\nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating \nbevacizumab in combination with IFL as first-line treatment for metastatic carcinoma of the colon or \nrectum. Eight hundred and thirteen patients were randomised to receive IFL + placebo (Arm 1) or\nIFL + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, Arm 2). A third group of 110 patients received bolus \n5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (Arm 3). Enrolment in Arm 3 was discontinued, as pre-specified, once \nsafety of bevacizumab with the IFL regimen was established and considered acceptable. All \ntreatments were continued until disease progression. The overall mean age was 59.4 years; 56.6% of \npatients had an ECOG performance status of 0, 43% had a value of 1 and 0.4% had a value of 2. \n15.5% had received prior radiotherapy and 28.4% prior chemotherapy.\n\nThe primary efficacy variable of the trial was overall survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFL \nresulted in statistically significant increases in overall survival, progression-free survival and overall \nresponse rate (see Table 4). The clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival, was seen in all \npre-specified patient subgroups, including those defined by age, sex, performance status, location of\n\n\n\n24\n\nprimary tumour, number of organs involved and duration of metastatic disease.\n\nThe efficacy results of bevacizumab in combination with IFL-chemotherapy are displayed in Table 4.\n\nTable 4 Efficacy results for trial AVF2107g\n\nAVF2107g\n\nArm 1 \n\nIFL + placebo\n\nArm 2 \n\nIFL + bevacizumaba\n\nNumber of patients 411 402\n\nOverall survival\nMedian time (months) 15.6 20.3\n\n95% CI 14.29 – 16.99 18.46 – 24.18\n\nHazard ratiob 0.660\n(p-value = 0.00004)\n\nProgression-free survival\n\nMedian time (months) 6.2 10.6\n\nHazard ratio 0.54\n(p-value < 0.0001)\n\nOverall response rate\n\nRate (%) 34.8 44.8\n\n(p-value = 0.0036)\n\na 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks.\nb Relative to control arm.\n\nAmong the 110 patients randomised to Arm 3 (5-FU/FA + bevacizumab) prior to discontinuation of \nthis arm, the median overall survival was 18.3 months and the median progression free survival was\n8.8 months.\n\nAVF2192g\nThis was a phase II randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of bevacizumab in combination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment for metastatic \ncolorectal cancer in patients who were not optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan treatment. One \nhundred and five patients were randomised to 5-FU/FA + placebo arm and 104 patients to \n5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) arm. All treatments were continued until disease \nprogression. The addition of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher \nobjective response rates, significantly longer progression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival \nas compared to 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone.\n\nAVF0780g\nThis was a phase II randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled clinical trial investigating \nbevacizumab in combination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The \nmedian age was 64 years. 19% of the patients had received prior chemotherapy and 14% prior \nradiotherapy. Seventy-one patients were randomised to receive bolus 5-FU/FA or \n5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). A third group of 33 patients received bolus \n5-FU/FA + bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression. \nThe primary endpoints of the trial were objective response rate and progression-free survival. The \naddition of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response \nrates, longer progression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival, compared with 5-FU/FA \nchemotherapy alone (see Table 5). These efficacy data are consistent with the results from trial \nAVF2107g.\n\n\n\n25\n\nThe efficacy data from trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g investigating bevacizumab in \ncombination with 5-FU/FA-chemotherapy are summarised in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Efficacy results for trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g\n\nAVF0780g AVF2192g\n\n5-FU/FA\n5-FU/FA +\n\nbevacizumaba\n5-FU/FA +\n\nbevacizumabb\n5-FU/FA +\n\nplacebo\n5-FU/FA +\n\nbevacizumab\n\nNumber of patients 36 35 33 105 104\n\nOverall survival\nMedian time (months) 13.6 17.7 15.2 12.9 16.6\n\n95% CI 10.35 -\n16.95\n\n13.63 -\n19.32\n\nHazard ratioc - 0.52 1.01 0.79\n\np-value 0.073 0.978 0.16\n\nProgression-free survival\nMedian time (months) 5.2 9.0 7.2 5.5 9.2\n\nHazard ratio 0.44 0.69 0.5\n\np-value - 0.0049 0.217 0.0002\n\nOverall response rate\nRate (percent) 16.7 40.0 24.2 15.2 26\n\n95% CI 7.0 - 33.5 24.4 - 57.8 11.7 - 42.6 9.2 - 23.9 18.1 - 35.6\n\np-value 0.029 0.43 0.055\n\nDuration of response\nMedian time (months) NR 9.3 5.0 6.8 9.2\n\n25–75 percentile (months) 5.5 – NR 6.1 - NR 3.8 - 7.8 5.59 - 9.17 5.88 - 13.01\na 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks.\nb 10 mg/kg every 2 \nweeks. \n\nc Relative to control arm. \nNR = not reached.\n\nNO16966\nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind (for bevacizumab), clinical trial investigating \nbevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg in combination with oral capecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin (XELOX), \nadministered on a 3- weekly schedule; or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg in combination with leucovorin with \n5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusional, with intravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4), \nadministered on a 2-weekly schedule.

In this trial, \nthere were two primary objectives: to show that XELOX was non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 and to show \nthat bevacizumab in combination with FOLFOX-4 or XELOX chemotherapy was superior to \nchemotherapy alone. Both co-primary objectives were met:\n\n Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the \nFOLFOX-4-containing arms in the overall comparison was demonstrated in terms of \nprogression-free survival and overall survival in the eligible per-protocol population.\n\n Superiority of the bevacizumab-containing arms versus the chemotherapy alone arms \nin the overall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the \nITT population (Table 7).\n\nSecondary PFS analyses, based on ‘on-treatment’-based response assessments, confirmed the \nsignificantly superior clinical benefit for patients treated with bevacizumab (analyses shown in \nTable 7), consistent with the statistically significant benefit observed in the pooled analysis.\n\n\n\n27\n\nTable 7 Key efficacy results for the superiority analysis (ITT population, trial NO16966)\n\nEndpoint (months) FOLFOX-4 or \nXELOX\n\n+ placebo \n(n=701)\n\nFOLFOX-4 or \nXELOX\n\n+ bevacizumab \n(n=699)\n\nP-value\n\nPrimary endpoint\n\nMedian PFS** 8.0 9.4 0.0023\n\nHazard ratio (97.5% CI) a 0.83 (0.72–0.95)\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\nMedian PFS (on treatment)** 7.9 10.4 < 0.0001\n\nHazard ratio (97.5% CI) 0.63 (0.52-0.75)\n\nOverall response rate \n(invest. assessment)**\n\n49.2% 46.5%\n\nMedian overall survival* 19.9 21.2 0.0769\n\nHazard ratio (97.5% CI) 0.89 (0.76-1.03)\n\n*Overall survival analysis at clinical cut-off 31 January 2007\n** Primary analysis at clinical cut-off 31 January 2006\na relative to control arm\n\nIn the FOLFOX treatment subgroup, the median PFS was 8.6 months in placebo and 9.4 months in \nbevacizumab treated patients, HR = 0.89, 97.5% CI = [0.73; 1.08]; p-value = 0.1871, the \ncorresponding results in the XELOX treatment subgroup being 7.4 vs. 9.3 months, HR = 0.77, \n97.5% CI = [0.63; 0.94]; p-value = 0.0026.\n\nThe median overall survival was 20.3 months in placebo and 21.2 months in bevacizumab treated \npatients in the FOLFOX treatment subgroup, HR=0.94, 97.5% CI = [0.75; 1.16]; p-value = 0.4937, \nthe corresponding results in the XELOX, treatment subgroup being 19.2 vs. 21.4 months, HR = 0.84, \n97.5% CI = [0.68; 1.04]; p-value = 0.0698.\n\nECOG E3200\nThis was a phase III randomised, active-controlled, open-label trial investigating bevacizumab\n10 mg/kg in combination with leucovorin with 5-fluorouracil bolus and then 5-fluorouracil \ninfusional, with intravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4), administered on a 2-weekly schedule in \npreviously-treated patients (second line) with advanced colorectal cancer. In the chemotherapy \narms, the FOLFOX-4 regimen used the same doses and schedule as shown in Table 6 for trial \nNO16966.\n\nThe primary efficacy parameter of the trial was overall survival, defined as the time from \nrandomisation to death from any cause. Eight hundred and twenty-nine patients were randomised \n(292 FOLFOX-4, 293 bevacizumab + FOLFOX-4 and 244 bevacizumab monotherapy).

Treatment was given \nuntil progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome measure was overall survival \ndefined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause.\n\nA total of 820 patients were randomised. The addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-based \nchemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of survival in patients with mCRC \nwho have progressed on a first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen (ITT = 819) (see Table 9).\n\n\n\n29\n\nTable 9 Efficacy results for study ML18147 (ITT population)\n\nML18147\n\nFluoropyrimidine/irinotecan\nor \n\nfluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin\nbased chemotherapy\n\nFluoropyrimidine/irinotecan\nor \n\nfluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin\nbased chemotherapy\n\n+ bevacizumaba\n\nNumber of patients 410 409\n\nOverall survival\n\nMedian (months) 9.8 11.2\n\nHazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\n0.81 (0.69, 0.94)\n\n(p-value = 0.0062)\n\nProgression-free survival\n\nMedian (months) 4.1 5.7\n\nHazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\n0.68 (0.59, 0.78)\n\n(p-value < 0.0001)\n\nObjective response rate (ORR)\n\nPatients included in analysis 406 404\n\nRate 3.9% 5.4%\n\n(p-value = 0.3113)\na 5.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks\n\nStatistically significant improvements in progression-free survival were also observed. \nObjective response rate was low in both treatment arms and the difference was not significant.\n\nStudy E3200 used a 5 mg/kg/week equivalent dose of bevacizumab in bevacizumab-naïve patients, \nwhile study ML18147 used a 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent dose of bevacizumab in \nbevacizumab-pretreated patients. A cross-trial comparison of the efficacy and safety data is limited \nby differences between these studies, most notably in patient populations, previous bevacizumab \nexposure and chemotherapy regimens. Both the 5 mg/kg/week and 2.5 mg/kg/week equivalent doses \nof bevacizumab provided a statistically significant benefit with regards to OS (HR 0.751 in study \nE3200; HR 0.81 in study ML18147) and PFS (HR 0.518 in study E3200; HR 0.68 in study \nML18147). In terms of safety, there was a higher overall incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs in study E3200 \nrelative to study ML18147.\n\nMetastatic breast cancer (mBC)\n\nTwo large Phase III trials were designed to investigate the treatment effect of bevacizumab in \ncombination with two individual chemotherapy agents, as measured by the primary endpoint of PFS. A \nclinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in both trials. \n\nSummarised below are PFS results for the individual chemotherapy agents included in the indication: \n\n Study E2100 (paclitaxel) \no Median PFS increase 5.6 months, HR 0.421 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.343; 0.516) \n\n Study AVF3694g (capecitabine) \no Median PFS increase 2.9 months, HR 0.69 (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 0.56; 0.84) \n\nFurther details of each study and the results are provided below.\n\nECOG E2100\nTrial E2100 was an open-label, randomised, active controlled, multicentre clinical trial evaluating \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer in patients \nwho had not previously received chemotherapy for locally recurrent and metastatic disease. Patients \n\n\n\n30\n\nwere randomised to paclitaxel alone (90 mg/m2 intravenous over 1 hour once weekly for three out of \nfour weeks) or in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every two weeks). \nPrior hormonal therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease was allowed. Adjuvant taxane therapy \nwas allowed only if it was completed at least 12 months prior to trial entry. Of the 722 patients in the \ntrial, the majority of patients had HER2-negative disease (90%), with a small number of patients with \nunknown (8%) or confirmed HER2-positive status (2%), who had previously been treated with or were \nconsidered unsuitable for trastuzumab therapy. Furthermore, 65% of patients had received adjuvant \nchemotherapy including 19% prior taxanes and 49% prior anthracyclines. Patients with central nervous \nsystem metastases, including previously treated or resected brain lesions, were excluded.\n\nIn trial E2100, patients were treated until disease progression. In situations where early \ndiscontinuation of chemotherapy was required, treatment with bevacizumab as a single agent \ncontinued until disease progression. The patient characteristics were similar across the trial arms. \nThe primary endpoint of this trial was progression free survival (PFS), based on trial investigators’ \nassessment of disease progression. In addition, an independent review of the primary endpoint was \nalso conducted.

The choices of chemotherapy \nincluded capecitabine, taxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel), and anthracycline-based agents \n(doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/ doxorubicin/ \ncyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) given every three weeks (q3w). \nBevacizumab or placebo was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w. \n\nThis study included a blinded treatment phase, an optional open-label post-progression phase, and a \nsurvival follow-up phase. During the blinded treatment phase, patients received chemotherapy and \nmedicinal product (bevacizumab or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment-\nlimiting toxicity, or death. On documented disease progression, patients who entered the optional \nopen-label phase could receive open-label bevacizumab together with a wide-range of second line \ntherapies. \n\nStatistical analyses were performed independently for 1) patients who received capecitabine in \ncombination with bevacizumab or placebo; 2) patients who received taxane-based or \nanthracycline-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab or placebo. The primary endpoint \nof the study was PFS by investigator assessment. In addition, the primary endpoint was also assessed by \nan independent review committee (IRC). \n\nThe results of this study from the final protocol defined analyses for progression free survival and \nresponse rates for the independently powered capecitabine cohort of Study AVF3694g are presented \nin Table 11. Results from an exploratory overall survival analysis which include an additional \n7 months of follow-up (approximately 46% of patients had died) are also presented. The percentage \nof patients who received bevacizumab in the open-label phase was 62.1% in the capecitabine + \nplacebo arm and 49.9% in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm.\n\nTable 11 Efficacy results for study AVF3694g: – Capecitabinea and Bevacizumab/Placebo\n(Cap + Bevacizumab/Pl)\n\nProgression-free survivalb\n\nInvestigator Assessment IRC Assessment\n\nCap + Pl\n(n=206)\n\nCap + \nBevacizumab\n\n(n=409)\n\nCap + Pl\n(n=206)\n\nCap + \nBevacizumab\n(n=409)\n\nMedian PFS (months) 5.7 8.6 6.2 9.8\n\nHazard ratio vs\nplacebo arm (95% CI)\n\n0.69 (0.56; 0.84) 0.68 (0.54; 0.86)\n\np-value 0.0002 0.0011\n\nResponse rate (for patients with measurable disease)b\n\nCap + Pl (n=161) Cap + Bevacizumab (n=325)\n\n% pts with objective\nresponse\n\n23.6 35.4\n\np-value 0.0097\n\n\n\n32\n\nOverall survivalb\n\nHR\n\n(95% CI)\n0.88 (0.69; 1.13)\n\np-value (exploratory) 0.33\n\na1000 mg/m2 oral twice daily for 14 days administered every 3 weeks.\nbStratified analysis included all progression and death events except those where non-protocol therapy (NPT)\nwas initiated prior to documented progression; data from those patients were censored at the last tumour\nassessment prior to starting NPT.\n\nAn unstratified analysis of PFS (investigator assessed) was performed that did not censor for non-\nprotocol therapy prior to disease progression.

An overall survival benefit has been demonstrated in trial E4599 with a\n15 mg/kg/q3wk dose of bevacizumab. Trial BO17704 has demonstrated that both 7.5 mg/kg/q3wk \nand 15 mg/kg/q3wk bevacizumab doses increase progression free survival and response rate.\n\nE4599\nE4599 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, multicentre clinical trial evaluating \nbevacizumab as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced (stage IIIb with malignant \npleural effusion), metastatic or recurrent NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology.\n\nPatients were randomised to platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2) and carboplatin\nAUC = 6.0, both by intravenous infusion (PC) on day 1 of every 3-week cycle for up to 6 cycles or \nPC in combination with bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenous infusion day 1 of every \n3-week cycle. After completion of six cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy or upon \npremature discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients on the bevacizumab + carboplatin–paclitaxel \narm continued to receive bevacizumab as a single agent every 3 weeks until disease progression. \n878 patients were randomised to the two arms.\n\nDuring the trial, of the patients who received trial treatment, 32.2% (136/422) of patients received\n7-12 administrations of bevacizumab and 21.1% (89/422) of patients received 13 or more \nadministrations of bevacizumab.\n\nThe primary endpoint was duration of survival.

The \nprimary endpoint was progression free survival, secondary endpoints for the trial included the \nduration of overall survival.\n\nPatients were randomised to platinum-based chemotherapy, cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion \non day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of every 3-week cycle for \nup to 6 cycles (CG) with placebo or CG with bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg intravenous\ninfusion day 1 of every 3-week cycle. In the bevacizumab-containing arms, patients could receive \nbevacizumab as a single-agent every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Trial \nresults show that 94% (277 / 296) of eligible patients went on to receive single agent bevacizumab at\ncycle 7.

The 649 randomised patients (641 treated) had Karnofsky Performance Status \n(KPS) of ≥ 70%, no CNS metastases and adequate organ function. Patients were nephrectomised for \nprimary renal cell carcinoma. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks until disease \nprogression. IFN alfa-2a was given up to 52 weeks or until disease progression at a recommended \nstarting dose of 9 MIU three times a week, allowing a dose reduction to 3 MIU three times a week in \n2 steps. Patients were stratified according to country and Motzer score and the treatment arms were\nshown to be well balanced for the prognostic factors.\n\nThe primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints for the trial including \nprogression-free survival. The addition of bevacizumab to IFN-alpha-2a significantly increased PFS \nand objective tumour response rate. These results have been confirmed through an independent \nradiological review. However, the increase in the primary endpoint of overall survival by 2 months \nwas not significant (HR= 0.91). A high proportion of patients (approximately 63% IFN/placebo; \n55% bevacizumab/IFN) received a variety of non-specified post-trial anti-cancer therapies, \nincluding antineoplastic agents, which may have impacted the analysis of overall survival.\n\n\n\n35\n\nThe efficacy results are presented in Table 14\n\nTable 14 Efficacy results for trial BO17705\n\nBO17705\n\nPlacebo + IFNa Bvb + IFNa\n\nNumber of patients 322 327\n\nProgression-free survival\n\nMedian (months) \n\nHazard ratio\n\n95% CI\n\n5.4 10.2\n\n0.63\n0.52, 0.75\n\n(p-value < 0.0001)\n\nObjective response rate (%) in Patients with \nmeasurable disease\n\nN\nResponse rate\n\n289 306\n12.8% 31.4%\n\n(p-value < 0.0001)\n\na Interferon alfa-2a 9 MIU 3x/week\nb Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q 2 wk\n\nOverall survival\n\nMedian (months)\n\nHazard ratio\n\n95% CI\n\n21.3 23.3\n0.91\n\n0.76, 1.10\n(p-value 0.3360)\n\nAn exploratory multivariate Cox regression model using backward selection indicated that the \nfollowing baseline prognostic factors were strongly associated with survival independent of \ntreatment: gender, white blood cell count, platelets, body weight loss in the 6 months prior to trial \nentry, number of metastatic sites, sum of longest diameter of target lesions, Motzer score. \nAdjustment for these baseline factors resulted in a treatment hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI [0.63; \n0.96], p=0.0219), indicating a 22% reduction in the risk of death for patients in the \nbevacizumab + IFN alfa-2a arm compared to IFN alfa-2a arm.\n\nNinety seven (97) patients in the IFN alfa-2a arm and 131 patients in the bevacizumab arm reduced \nthe dose of IFN alfa-2a from 9 MIU to either 6 or 3 MIU three times a week as pre-specified in the \nprotocol.

A total of 104 patients were randomised to treatment in this \ntrial, 53 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo and 51 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every \n2 weeks plus erlotinib 150 mg daily. The analysis of the primary endpoint showed no difference \nbetween the bevacizumab + Placebo arm and the bevacizumab + Erlotinib arm (median PFS 8.5 \nversus 9.9 months). Seven patients in each arm had an objective response. The addition of erlotinib to \nbevacizumab did not result in an improvement in OS (HR = 1.764; p=0.1789), duration of objective \nresponse (6.7 vs 9.1 months) or time to symptom progression (HR = 1.172; p=0.5076).\n\n\n\n36\n\nAVF0890\nThis was a randomised phase II trial conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab \nversus placebo. A total of 116 patients were randomised to receive bevacizumab 3 mg/kg every \n2 weeks (n=39), 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; (n=37), or placebo (n=40). An interim analysis showed \nthere was a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the 10 mg/kg group as \ncompared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.55; p < 0.001). There was a small difference, of \nborderline significance, between the time to progression of disease in the 3 mg/kg group and that in\nthe placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; p=0.053). Four patients had objective (partial) response, and all \nof these had received the 10 mg/kg dose bevacizumab; the ORR for the 10 mg/kg dose was 10%.\n\nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer\n\nFront-line treatment of ovarian cancer\n\nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in the front-line treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian,\nfallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer were studied in two phase III trials (GOG-0218 and\nBO17707) that evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel\ncompared to the chemotherapy regimen alone.\n\nGOG-0218\nThe GOG-0218 study was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three\narm study evaluating the effect of adding bevacizumab to an approved chemotherapy regimen\n(carboplatin and paclitaxel) in patients with advanced (Stages IIIB, IIIC and IV according to FIGO\nstaging version dated 1988) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nPatients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anticancer therapy for\novarian cancer (e.g. chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or\nhormonal therapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study.\n\nA total of 1873 patients were randomised in equal proportions to the following three arms:\n\n CPP arm: Five cycles of placebo (started cycle 2) in combination with carboplatin (AUC \n6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a total of up to \n15 months of therapy\n\n CPB15 arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination\nwith carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo\nalone, for a total of up to 15 months of therapy\n\n CPB15+ arm: Five cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination\nwith carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by continued\nuse of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q3w) as single agent for a total of up to 15 months of\ntherapy.\n\nThe majority of patients included in the study were White (87% in all three arms); the median age was\n60 years in CPP and CPB15 arms and 59 years in CPB15+ arm; and 29% of patients in CPP or CPB15\nand 26% in CPB15+ were over 65 years of age. Overall approximately 50% of patients had a GOG PS\nof 0 at baseline, 43% a GOG PS score of 1, and 7% a GOG PS score of 2. Most patients had EOC (82%\nin CPP and CPB15, 85% in CPB15+) followed by PPC (16% in CPP, 15% in CPB15, 13% in CPB15+)\nand FTC (1% in CPP, 3% in CPB15, 2% in CPB15+). The majority of patients had serous\nadenocarcinoma histologic type (85% in CPP and CPB15, 86% in CPB15+). Overall approximately\n34% of patients were FIGO Stage III optimally debulked with gross residual disease, 40% Stage III\nsub-optimally debulked, and 26% were Stage IV patients.\n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS based on investigator’s assessment of disease progression based on\nradiological scans or CA 125 levels, or symptomatic deterioration per protocol. In addition, a\nprespecified analysis of the data censoring for CA-125 progression events was conducted, as well as\nan independent review of PFS as determined by radiological scans.\n\n\n\n37\n\nThe trial met its primary objective of PFS improvement. Compared to patients treated with\nchemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) alone in the front-line setting, patients who received\nbevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w in combination with chemotherapy and continued to receive\nbevacizumab alone (CPB15+), had a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement\nin PFS.\n\nIn patients who only received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and did not continue to\nreceive bevacizumab alone (CPB15), no clinically meaningful benefit in PFS was observed.\n\nThe results of this study are summarised in Table 15.\n\nTable 15 Efficacy results from study GOG-0218\n\nProgression-free survival 1\n\nCPP CPB15 CPB15+\n(n = 625) (n = 625) (n = 623)\n\nMedian PFS (months) 10.6 11.6 14.7\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) 2 0.89 0.70\n\n(0.78, 1.02) (0.61, 0.81)\np-value 3,4 0.0437 < 0.0001\nObjective response Rate 5\n\nCPP CPB15 CPB15 +\n(n = 396) (n = 393) (n = 403)\n\n% pts with objective response 63.4 66.2 66.0\np-value 0.2341 0.2041\nOverall survival 6\n\nCPP CPB15 CPB15 +\n(n = 625) (n = 625) (n = 623)\n\nMedian OS (months) 40.6 38.8 43.8\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) 2 1.07 (0.91, 1.25) 0.88 (0.75, 1.04)\np-value 3 0.2197 0.0641\n\n1 Investigator assessed GOG protocol-specified PFS analysis (neither censored for CA-125 progressions nor\ncensored for NPT prior to disease progression) with data cut-off date of 25 February, 2010.\n\n2 Relative to the control arm; stratified hazard ratio.\n3 One-sided log-rank p-value\n4 Subject to a p-value boundary of 0.0116.\n5 Patients with measurable disease at baseline.\n6 Final overall survival analysis performed when 46.9% of the patients had died.\n\nPrespecified PFS analyses were conducted, all with a cut-off date of 29 September 2009.

Treatment with bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for 6 and up to 8 cycles, \nfollowed by bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity resulted, when data were \nderived from eCRF, in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in OS \ncompared to treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.\n\nMO22224 \nStudy MO22224 evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \nfor platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. This \nstudy was designed as an open-label, randomized, two-arm Phase III evaluation of bevacizumab plus \nchemotherapy (CT+BV) versus chemotherapy alone (CT). \n\nA total of 361 patients were enrolled into this study and administered either chemotherapy (paclitaxel,\ntopotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) alone or in combination with bevacizumab: \n\n CT Arm (chemotherapy alone): \no Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 as a 1-hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 4 weeks. \no Topotecan 4 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. \n\nAlternatively, a 1.25 mg/m2 dose could be administered over 30 minutes on Days 1–5 \nevery 3 weeks. \n\no PLD 40 mg/m2 as a 1 mg/min IV infusion on Day 1 only every 4 weeks. After Cycle 1, \nthe drug could be delivered as a 1-hour infusion.\n\n CT+BV Arm (chemotherapy plus bevacizumab): \no The chosen chemotherapy was combined with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every \n\n2 weeks (or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks if used in combination with \ntopotecan 1.25 mg/m2 on Days 1–5 every 3 weeks).\n\nEligible patients had epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that progressed \nwithin <6 months of previous platinum therapy consisting of a minimum of 4 platinum therapy cycles. \nPatients should have had a life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks and no prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or \nabdomen. Most patients were FIGO Stage IIIC or Stage IV. The majority of patients in both arms had \nan ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 (CT: 56.4% vs. CT + BV: 61.2%). The percentage of patients \nwith an ECOG PS of 1 or ≥ 2 was 38.7% and 5.0% in the CT arm, and 29.8% and 9.0% in the CT + BV \narm. Information on race exists for 29.3% of patients and nearly all patients were white. The median \nage of patients was 61.0 (range: 25−84) years. A total of 16 patients (4.4%) were > 75 years old. The \noverall rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 8.8% in the CT arm and 43.6% in the CT + \nBV arm (mostly due to Grade 2-3 adverse events) and the median time to discontinuation in the CT +\nBV arm was 5.2 months compared with 2.4 months in the CT arm. The rates of discontinuation due to \nadverse events in the subgroup of patients > 65 years old were 8.8% in the CT arm and 50.0% in the CT \n+ BV arm. The HR for PFS was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.62) and 0.45 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.67) for the < 65\nand ≥ 65 subgroups, respectively. \n\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free-survival, with secondary endpoints including objective \nresponse rate and overall survival.

There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of \nbevacizumab in children with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma.\n\n In a single-arm study (PBTC-022), 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine \nhigh-grade glioma (including 8 with glioblastoma [WHO Grade IV], 9 with anaplastic \nastrocytoma [Grade III] and 1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma [Grade III]) were treated \nwith bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) two weeks apart and then with bevacizumab in combination \nwith CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m2) once every two weeks until progression. There were no \nobjective (partial or complete) radiological responses (MacDonald criteria). Toxicity and \nadverse reactions included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well as CNS ischaemia with \nacute neurological deficit.\n\n In a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) children with \nrelapsed or progressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO Grade IV, 9 with Grade III) were \n\n\n\n48\n\ntreated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m2) every 2 weeks. There were \nno complete responses and 2 partial responses (MacDonald criteria).\n\nIn a randomized phase II study (BO25041) a total of 121 patients aged ≥ 3 years to <18 years with \nnewly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) \nwere treated with post operative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (T) with and \nwithout bevacizumab: 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenously.\n\nThe study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement of EFS \n(Central Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)-assessed) when bevacizumab was added to the RT/T \narm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent with \nthose from various sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups. The results for all \nsecondary endpoints (investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no \nimprovement associated with the addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T \narm alone.\n\nAddition of bevacizumab to RT/T did not demonstrate clinical benefit in study BO25041 in \n60 evaluable children patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or \npeduncular high- grade glioma (HGG) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nSoft tissue sarcoma\n\nIn a randomized phase II study (BO20924) a total of 154 patients aged ≥ 6 months to <18 years with \nnewly diagnosed metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma \nwere treated with standard of care (Induction IVADO/IVA+/- local therapy followed by Maintenance \nVinorelbine and cyclophosphamide) with or without bevacizumab (2.5 mg/kg/week) for a total \nduration of treatment of approximately 18 months. At the time of the final primary analysis, the \nprimary endpoint of EFS by independent central review did not show a statistically significant \ndifference between the two treatment arms, with HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72).\n\nThe difference in ORR per independent central review was 18% (CI: 0.6%, 35.3%) between the two \ntreatment arms in the few patients who had evaluable tumor at baseline and had a confirmed response \nprior to receiving any local therapy: 27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the Chemo arm \nand 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv +Chemo arm. The secondary endpoint of \nOverall Survival (OS) was not mature. Until mature OS results and safety data are available no \ndefinitive conclusion can be drawn on the benefit/risk balance.\n\nAddition of bevacizumab to standard of care did not demonstrate clinical benefit in clinical trial \nBO20924, in 71 evaluable children (from age 6 months to less than 18 years old) patients with \nmetastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma and non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma.\n(See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nThe incidence of AEs, including Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs, was similar between the two treatment \narms. No AEs leading to death occurred in either treatment arm; all deaths were attributed to disease \nprogression. Bevacizumab addition to multimodal standard of care treatment seemed to be tolerated in \nthis paediatric population.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic data for bevacizumab are available from ten clinical trials in patients with solid \ntumours. In all clinical trials, bevacizumab was administered as an intravenous infusion. The rate of \ninfusion was based on tolerability, with an initial infusion duration of 90 minutes. The \npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was linear at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe typical value for central volume (Vc) was 2.73 L and 3.28 L for female and male patients \nrespectively, which is in the range that has been described for IgGs and other monoclonal antibodies. \nThe typical value for peripheral volume (Vp) was 1.69 L and 2.35 L for female and male patients \n\n\n\n49\n\nrespectively, when bevacizumab is co-administered with anti-neoplastic agents. After correcting for \nbody weight, male patients had a larger Vc (+ 20%) than female patients.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nAssessment of bevacizumab metabolism in rabbits following a single intravenous dose of \n125 I-bevacizumab indicated that its metabolic profile was similar to that expected for a native IgG \nmolecule which does not bind VEGF. The metabolism and elimination of bevacizumab is similar to \nendogenous IgG i.e. primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body, including endothelial \ncells, and does not rely primarily on elimination through the kidneys and liver. Binding of the IgG to \nthe FcRn receptor results in protection from cellular metabolism and the long terminal half-life.\n\nElimination\n\nThe value for clearance is, on average, equal to 0.188 and 0.220 L/day for female and male patients, \nrespectively. After correcting for body weight, male patients had a higher bevacizumab clearance\n(+ 17%) than females. According to the two-compartmental model, the elimination half-life is \n18 days for a typical female patient and 20 days for a typical male patient.\n\nLow albumin and high tumour burden are generally indicative of disease severity. Bevacizumab \nclearance was approximately 30% faster in patients with low levels of serum albumin and 7% faster \nin subjects with higher tumour burden when compared with a typical patient with median values of \nalbumin and tumour burden.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nThe population pharmacokinetics were analysed in adult and pediatric patients to evaluate the \neffects of demographic characteristics. In adults, the results showed no significant difference in the \npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in relation to age.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in renally \nimpaired patients since the kidneys are not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with \nhepatic impairment since the liver is not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab were evaluated in 152 children, adolescents and young adults \n(7 months to 21 years, 5.9 to 125 kg) across 4 clinical studies using a population pharmacokinetic \nmodel. The pharmacokinetic results show that the clearance and volume of distribution of \nbevacizumab were comparable between paediatric and young adult patients when normalised by \nbody weight, with exposure trending lower as body weight decreased. Age was not associated with \nthe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab when body weight was taken into account.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was well characterized by the paediatric population PK \nmodel for 70 patients in Study BO20924 ((1.4 to 17.6 years; 11.6 to 77.5 kg) and 59 patients in \nStudy BO25041 (1 to 17 years; 11.2 to 82.3 kg). In Study BO20924, bevacizumab exposure was \ngenerally lower compared to a typical adult patient at the same dose. In Study BO25041, \nbevacizumab exposure was similar compared to a typical adult at the same dose. In both studies, \nbevacizumb exposure trended lower as body weight decreased.\n\n\n\n50\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn studies of up to 26 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, physeal dysplasia was observed \nin young animals with open growth plates, at bevacizumab average serum concentrations below \nthe expected human therapeutic average serum concentrations. In rabbits, bevacizumab was \nshown to inhibit wound healing at doses below the proposed clinical dose. Effects on wound \nhealing were shown to be fully reversible.\n\nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of bevacizumab have not been performed.\n\nNo specific studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the effect on fertility. An adverse \neffect on female fertility can however be expected as repeat dose toxicity studies in animals have \nshown inhibition of the maturation of ovarian follicles and a decrease/absence of corpora lutea and \nassociated decrease in ovarian and uterus weight as well as a decrease in the number of menstrual \ncycles.\n\nBevacizumab has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rabbits. \nObserved effects included decreases in maternal and foetal body weights, an increased number of \nfoetal resorptions and an increased incidence of specific gross and skeletal foetal malformations. \nAdverse foetal outcomes were observed at all tested doses, of which the lowest dose resulted in \naverage serum concentrations approximately 3 times larger than in humans receiving 5 mg/kg every \n2 weeks. Information on foetal malformations observed in the post marketing setting are provided \nin section 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation and 4.8 Undesirable Effects.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n● Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n● If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n● If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What Zirabev is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Zirabev\n3. How to use Zirabev\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Zirabev\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zirabev is and what it is used for\n\nZirabev contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a \ntype of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection \nand cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth \nfactor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF \nprotein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with \nnutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by \nblocking the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour.\n\nZirabev is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, \ni.e., in the colon or rectum. Zirabev will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment \ncontaining a fluoropyrimidine medicine.\n\nZirabev is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for \npatients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called \npaclitaxel or capecitabine.\n\nZirabev is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. \nZirabev will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum.\n\nZirabev is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for \npatients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon.\n\nZirabev is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian \ntube, or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated \nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Zirabev will be administered in \ncombination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n\n\n\n66\n\nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated \nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Zirabev will be administered in \ncombination with topotecan or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.\n\nZirabev is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical \ncancer. Zirabev will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, \npaclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy.\n\n2.

Please let your doctor, pharmacist or nurse know if \nyou have previously experienced problems after injections, such as dizziness/feeling of \nfainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash.\n\n● A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \nhas been associated with bevacizumab treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, \nconfusion or seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor.\n\nPlease consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. \n\nBefore you are given Zirabev or while you are being treated with Zirabev:\n● if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the \n\nmouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor \nand dentist immediately.\n\n● if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that \nyou are being treated with Zirabev, in particular when you are also receiving or have \nreceived an injection of bisphosphonate into your blood.\n\nYou may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Zirabev.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nZirabev use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the \nsafety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations.\n\nDeath of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under \n18 years old when treated with bevacizumab.\n\nOther medicines and Zirabev\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nCombinations of Zirabev with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and \ngastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you \ndo not combine these medicine.\n\nTell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast \ncancer. These therapies in combination with Zirabev may increase the risk of severe side effects.\n\n\n\n68\n\nPlease tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy.\n\nPregnancy, breast feeding and fertility\nYou must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Zirabev may cause damage to your unborn baby \nas it may stop the formation of new blood vessels.
