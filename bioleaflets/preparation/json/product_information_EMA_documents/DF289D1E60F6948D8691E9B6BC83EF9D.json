If a dose is missed, treatment should be resumed as soon as possible. The cycle should be \nrepeated every 4 weeks depending on the patient's clinical response and observed toxicity. It is \nrecommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 cycles; however, a complete or partial \nremission may take longer than 4 cycles to be obtained. Treatment may be continued as long as the \npatient shows response, continues to benefit or exhibits stable disease, i.e., in the absence of overt \nprogression.\n\nIf after 4 cycles, the patient’s haematological values (e.g., platelet counts or absolute neutrophil count), \nhave not returned to pre-treatment levels or if disease progression occurs (peripheral blast counts are \nincreasing or bone marrow blast counts are worsening), the patient may be considered to be a \nnon-responder and alternative therapeutic options to Dacogen should be considered.\n\nPre-medication for the prevention of nausea and vomiting is not routinely recommended but may be \nadministered if required.\n\n\n\n3\n\nManagement of myelosuppression and associated complications\nMyelosuppression and adverse events related to myelosuppression (thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, \nneutropaenia, and febrile neutropaenia) are common in both treated and untreated patients with AML. \nComplications of myelosuppression include infections and bleeding. Treatment may be delayed at the \ndiscretion of the treating physician, if the patient experiences myelosuppression-associated \ncomplications, such as those described below:\n\n Febrile neutropaenia (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/µL)\n Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection (i.e., requiring intravenous anti-infectives or extensive \n\nsupportive care)\n Haemorrhage (gastrointestinal, genito-urinary, pulmonary with platelets < 25,000/µL or any \n\ncentral nervous system haemorrhage)\n\nTreatment with Dacogen may be resumed once these conditions have improved or have been stabilised\nwith adequate treatment (anti-infective therapy, transfusions, or growth factors).\n\nIn clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients receiving Dacogen required a dose-delay. Dose \nreduction is not recommended.\n\nPaediatric population\nDacogen should not be used in children with AML aged < 18 years, because efficacy was not \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.\n\nHepatic impairment\nStudies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. The need for dose adjustment in \npatients with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. If worsening hepatic function occurs, patients \nshould be carefully monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nStudies in patients with renal impairment have not been conducted. The need for dose adjustment in \npatients with renal impairment has not been evaluated (see section 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nDacogen is administered by intravenous infusion. A central venous catheter is not required.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to decitabine or to any of the excipients, listed in section 6.1.\n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6)\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nMyelosuppression\nMyelosuppression and complications of myelosuppression, including infections and bleeding that \noccur in patients with AML may be exacerbated with Dacogen treatment. Therefore, patients are at \nincreased risk for severe infections (due to any pathogen such as bacterial, fungal and viral), with \npotentially fatal outcome (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of\ninfection and treated promptly.\n\nIn clinical studies, the majority of patients had baseline Grade 3/4 myelosuppression. In patients with \nbaseline Grade 2 abnormalities, worsening of myelosuppression was seen in most patients and more \nfrequently than in patients with baseline Grade 1 or 0 abnormalities. Myelosuppression caused by \nDacogen is reversible. Complete blood and platelet counts should be performed regularly, as clinically \n\n\n\n4\n\nindicated and prior to each treatment cycle. In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, \ntreatment with Dacogen may be interrupted and/or supportive measures instituted (see sections 4.2 and \n4.8).\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (including pulmonary infiltrates, organising pneumonia and \npulmonary fibrosis) without signs of infectious aetiology have been reported in patients receiving \ndecitabine. Careful assessment of patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary \nsymptoms should be performed to exclude ILD. If ILD is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be \ninitiated (see section 4.8).\n\nHepatic impairment\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment has not been established. Caution should be exercised in the \nadministration of Dacogen to patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who develop signs or \nsymptoms of hepatic impairment. Liver function tests should be performed prior to initiation of \ntherapy and prior to each treatment cycle, and as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nUse in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied. Caution should be exercised in the \nadministration of Dacogen to patients with severe renal impairment (Creatinine Clearance [CrCl]\n< 30 ml/min). Renal function tests should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each \ntreatment cycle, and as clinically indicated (see section 4.2).\n\nCardiac disease\nPatients with a history of severe congestive heart failure or clinically unstable cardiac disease were \nexcluded from clinical studies and therefore, the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in these patients has \nnot been established. Cases of cardiomyopathy with cardiac decompensation, in some cases reversible \nafter treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or corrective treatment, have been reported in the \npostmarketing setting. Patients, especially those with cardiac disease history, should be monitored for \nsigns and symptoms of heart failure.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicine contains 0.5 mmol potassium per vial. After reconstitution and dilution of the solution \nfor intravenous infusion, this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) of potassium per dose, i.e. \nessentially ‘potassium- free’.\nThis medicine contains 0.29 mmol (6.67 mg) sodium per vial. After reconstitution and dilution of the \nsolution for intravenous infusion, this medicine contains between 13.8 mg-138 mg (0.6-6 mmol)\nsodium per dose (depending on the infusion fluid for dilution), equivalent to 0.7-7% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo formal clinical drug interaction studies with decitabine have been conducted.\nThere is the potential for a drug-drug interaction with other agents which are also activated by \nsequential phosphorylation (via intracellular phosphokinase activities) and/or metabolised by enzymes \nimplicated in the inactivation of decitabine (e.g., cytidine deaminase). Therefore, caution should be \nexercised if these active substances are combined with decitabine.\n\nImpact of co-administered medicinal products on decitabine\nCytochrome (CYP) 450-mediated metabolic interactions are not anticipated as decitabine metabolism \nis not mediated by this system but by oxidative deamination.\n\nImpact of decitabine on co-administered medicinal products\nGiven its low in vitro plasma protein binding ( 1%), decitabine is unlikely to displace \nco-administered medicinal products from their plasma protein binding. Decitabine has been shown to \nbe a weak inhibitor of P-gp mediated transport in vitro and is therefore, also not expected to affect \nP-gp mediated transport of co-administered medicinal products (see section 5.2).\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures and avoid becoming \npregnant while being treated with Dacogen. The time period following treatment with Dacogen where \nit is safe to become pregnant is unknown. Men should use effective contraceptive measures and be \nadvised to not father a child while receiving Dacogen, and for 3 months following completion of \ntreatment (see section 5.3).\n\nThe use of decitabine with hormonal contraceptives has not been studied.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data on the use of Dacogen in pregnant women. Studies have shown that \ndecitabine is teratogenic in rats and mice (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nBased on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Dacogen should not be used during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. If Dacogen is \nused during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving this medicinal product, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether decitabine or its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Dacogen is \ncontraindicated during breast-feeding; therefore, if treatment with this medicine is required, \nbreast-feeding must be discontinued (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of decitabine on fertility are available. In non-clinical animal studies, \ndecitabine alters male fertility and is mutagenic. Because of the possibility of infertility as a \nconsequence of Dacogen therapy, men should seek advice on conservation of sperm and female \npatients of childbearing potential should seek consultation regarding oocyte cryopreservation prior to \ninitiation of treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDacogen has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience undesirable effects such as anaemia during treatment. Therefore, caution \nshould be recommended when driving a car or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 35%) reported are pyrexia, anaemia and \nthrombocytopaenia.\n\nThe most common Grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) included pneumonia, \nthrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, febrile neutropaenia and anaemia.\n\nIn clinical studies, 30% of patients treated with Dacogen and 25% of patients treated in the comparator \narm had adverse events with an outcome of death during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose \nof study drug.\n\nIn the Dacogen treatment group, there was a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation due to \nadverse events in women compared to men (43% versus 32%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse drug reactions\nAdverse drug reactions reported in 293 AML patients treated with Dacogen are summarised in \nTable 1. The following table reflects data from AML clinical studies and from post-marketing \n\n\n\n6\n\nexperience. The adverse drug reactions are listed by frequency category. Frequency categories are \ndefined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.\n\nTable 1: Adverse drug reactions identified with Dacogen\n\nSystem Organ Class\nFrequency \n\n(all Grades) Adverse Drug Reaction\n\nFrequency\nAll Gradesa\n\n(%)\nGrades 3-4a\n\n(%)\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nVery common pneumonia* 24 20\nurinary tract infection* 15 7\nAll other infections (viral, \nbacterial, fungal)*, b, c, d\n\n63 39\n\nCommon septic shock* 6 4\nsepsis* 9 8\nsinusitis 3 1\n\nBlood and lymphatic \ndisorders\n\nVery common febrile neutropaenia* 34 32\nneutropaenia* 32 30\nthrombocytopaenia*, e 41 38\nanaemia 38 31\nleukopaenia 20 18\n\nUncommon pancytopaenia* < 1 < 1\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nCommon hypersensitivity including \nanaphylactic reactionf\n\n1 < 1\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nVery common hyperglycaemia 13 3\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nVery common headache 16 1\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiomyopathy < 1 < 1\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common epistaxis 14 2\nNot known interstitial lung disease Not known Not known\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common diarrhoea 31 2\nvomiting 18 1\nnausea 33 < 1\n\nCommon stomatitis 7 1\nNot known enterocolitis, including \n\nneutropaenic colitis, \ncaecitis*\n\nNot known Not known\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nVery common hepatic function abnormal 11 3\nCommon hyperbilirubinaemiag 5 <1\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon acute febrile neutrophilic \ndermatosis (Sweet’s \nsyndrome)\n\n< 1 NA\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nVery common pyrexia 48 9\n\n\n\n7\n\na\nWorst National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade.\n\nb\nExcluding pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, septic shock and sinusitis.\n\nc\nThe most frequently reported \"other infections\" in study DACO-016 were: oral herpes, oral candidiasis, pharyngitis, \nupper respiratory tract infection, cellulitis, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis.\n\nd\nIncluding enterocolitis infectious.\n\ne\nIncluding haemorrhage associated with thrombocytopaenia, including fatal cases.\n\nf\nIncluding preferred terms hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, \nanaphylactoid reaction, anaphylactoid shock.\n\ng\nIn clinical studies in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the reporting frequency for hyperbilirubinaemia \nwas 11% for All Grades and 2% for Grade 3-4.\n\n* Includes events with a fatal outcome.\nNA = Not applicable\n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions\n\nHaematologic adverse drug reactions\nThe most commonly reported haematologic adverse drug reactions associated with Dacogen treatment \nincluded febrile neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, anaemia and leukopaenia.\n\nSerious bleeding-related adverse drug reactions, some of which lead to a fatal outcome, such as central \nnervous system (CNS) haemorrhage (2%) and gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage (2%), in the context \nof severe thrombocytopaenia, were reported in patients receiving decitabine.\n\nHaematological adverse drug reactions should be managed by routine monitoring of complete blood \ncounts and early administration of supportive treatments as required. Supportive treatments include, \nadministration of prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor support (e.g., G-CSF) for neutropaenia \nand transfusions for anaemia or thrombocytopaenia according to institutional guidelines. For situations \nwhere decitabine administration should be delayed, see section 4.2.\n\nInfections and infestations adverse drug reactions\nSerious infection-related adverse drug reactions, with potentially fatal outcome, such as septic shock, \nsepsis, pneumonia, and other infections (viral, bacterial and fungal) were reported in patients receiving \ndecitabine.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nOccurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis have been reported during \ntreatment with decitabine. Enterocolitis may lead to septic complications and may be associated with \nfatal outcome.\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\nCases of interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary infiltrates, organising pneumonia and \npulmonary fibrosis) without signs of infectious aetiology have been reported in patients receiving \ndecitabine.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the limited safety data from a Phase I/II study \nto evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Dacogen in paediatric patients (aged 1 to \n14 years) with relapsed or refractory AML (n = 17) (see section 5.1). No new safety signal was \nobserved in this paediatric study.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no direct experience of human overdose and no specific antidote. However, early clinical \nstudy data in published literature at doses greater than 20 times higher than the current therapeutic \ndose, reported increased myelosuppression including prolonged neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. \nToxicity is likely to manifest as exacerbations of adverse drug reactions, primarily myelosuppression.\nTreatment for overdose should be supportive.\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues; ATC Code: \nL01BC08\n\nMechanism of action\nDecitabine (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue that selectively inhibits \nDNA methyltransferases at low doses, resulting in gene promoter hypomethylation that can result in \nreactivation of tumour suppressor genes, induction of cellular differentiation or cellular senescence \nfollowed by programmed cell death.\n\nClinical experience\nThe use of Dacogen was studied in an open-label, randomised, multicentre Phase III study \n(DACO-016) in subjects with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML according to the WHO \nclassification. Dacogen (n = 242) was compared to treatment choice (TC, n = 243) which consisted of \npatient’s choice with physician’s advice of either supportive care alone (n = 28, 11.5%) or 20 mg/m2\n\ncytarabine subcutaneously once daily for 10 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks \n(n = 215, 88.5%). Dacogen was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m2 once daily \nfor 5 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks.\n\nSubjects who were considered candidates for standard induction chemotherapy were not included in \nthe study as shown by the following baseline characteristics. The median age for the intent-to-treat \n(ITT) population was 73 years (range 64 to 91 years). Thirty-six percent of subjects had poor-risk\ncytogenetics at baseline. The remainder of the subjects had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Patients \nwith favourable cytogenetics were not included in the study. Twenty-five percent of subjects had an \nECOG performance status ≥ 2. Eighty-one percent of subjects had significant comorbidities (e.g., \ninfection, cardiac impairment, pulmonary impairment). The number of patients treated with Dacogen\nby racial group was White 209 (86.4%) and Asian 33 (13.6%).\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoint was complete \nremission rate that was assessed by independent expert review. Progression-free survival and \nEvent-free survival were tertiary endpoints.\n\nThe median overall survival in the --ITT population was 7.7 months in subjects treated with Dacogen\ncompared to 5.0 months for subjects in the TC arm (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.04, \np = 0.1079). The difference did not reach statistical significance, however, there was a trend for \nimprovement in survival with a 15% reduction in the risk of death for subjects in the Dacogen arm \n(Figure 1). When censored for potentially disease modifying subsequent therapy (i.e., induction \nchemotherapy or hypomethylating agent) the analysis for overall survival showed a 20% reduction in \nthe risk of death for subjects in the Dacogen arm [HR = 0.80, (95% CI: 0.64, 0.99), \np-value = 0.0437)].\n\n\n\n9\n\nFigure 1.

The primary \nendpoint was complete remission (CR) rate that was assessed by independent expert review. The \nsecondary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Dacogen was administered as a 1-hour \nintravenous infusion of 20 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 4 weeks. In the \nITT analysis, a CR rate of 23.6% (95% CI: 13.2, 37) was observed in 13/55 subjects treated with \nDacogen. The median time to CR was 4.1 months, and the median duration of CR was 18.2 months. \nThe median overall survival in the ITT population was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7, 11.5).\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Dacogen has not been evaluated in patients with acute promyelocytic \nleukaemia or CNS leukaemia.\n\nPaediatric population\nA Phase I/II open-label, multicentre study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in sequential \nadministration with cytarabine in children aged 1 month to < 18 years with relapsed or refractory \nAML. A total of 17 subjects were enrolled and received Dacogen 20 mg/m2 in this study, of which \n9 subjects received cytarabine 1 g/m2 and 8 subjects received cytarabine administered at the maximum \ntolerable dose of 2 g/m2. All subjects discontinued the study treatment. The reasons for treatment \ndiscontinuation included disease progression (12 [70.6%] subjects), subjects proceeding to transplant \n(3 [17.6%]), investigator decision (1 [5.9%]), and “other” (1 [5.9%]). Reported adverse events were \nconsistent with the known safety profile of Dacogen in adults (see section 4.8). Based on these \nnegative results, Dacogen should not be used in children with AML aged < 18 years, because efficacy \nwas not established (see section 4.2).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of decitabine were pooled from 3 clinical studies in \n45 patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) utilizing the 5-Day regimen. In each \nstudy, decitabine PK was evaluated on the fifth day of the first treatment cycle.\n\nDistribution\nThe pharmacokinetics of decitabine following intravenous administration as a 1-hour infusion were\ndescribed by a linear two-compartment model, characterised by rapid elimination from the central \ncompartment and by relatively slow distribution from the peripheral compartment. For a typical \npatient (weight 70 kg/body surface area 1.73 m2) the decitabine pharmacokinetic parameters are listed \nin the Table 3 below.\n\nTable 3: Summary of population PK analysis for a typical patient receiving daily 1-hour \ninfusions of Dacogen 20 mg/m2 over 5 days every 4 weeks\n\nParameter a Predicted Value 95% CI\nCmax (ng/ml) 107 88.5 - 129\nAUCcum (ng.h/ml) 580 480 - 695\nt1/2 (min) 68.2 54.2 - 79.6\nVdss (L) 116 84.1 - 153\nCL (L/h) 298 249 - 359\na\n\nThe total dose per cycle was 100 mg/m2\n\n\n\n12\n\nDecitabine exhibits linear PK and following the intravenous infusion, steady-state concentrations are \nreached within 0.5 hour. Based on model simulation, PK parameters were independent of time (i.e., \ndid not change from cycle to cycle) and no accumulation was observed with this dosing regimen. \nPlasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (< 1%). Decitabine Vdss in cancer patients is large \nindicating distribution into peripheral tissues. There was no evidence of dependencies on age, \ncreatinine clearance, total bilirubin, or disease.\n\nBiotransformation\nIntracellularly, decitabine is activated through sequential phosphorylation via phosphokinase activities \nto the corresponding triphosphate, which is then incorporated by the DNA polymerase. In vitro\nmetabolism data and the human mass balance study results indicated that the cytochrome P450 system \nis not involved in the metabolism of decitabine. The primary route of metabolism is likely through \ndeamination by cytidine deaminase in the liver, kidney, intestinal epithelium and blood. Results from \nthe human mass-balance study showed that unchanged decitabine in plasma accounted for \napproximately 2.4% of total radioactivity in plasma. The major circulating metabolites are not \nbelieved to be pharmacologically active. The presence of these metabolites in urine together with the \nhigh total body clearance and low urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine in the urine (~4% of the \ndose) indicate that decitabine is appreciably metabolized in vivo. In vitro studies show that decitabine \ndoes not inhibit nor induce CYP 450 enzymes up to more than 20-fold of the therapeutic maximum \nobserved plasma concentration (Cmax). Thus; CYP-mediated metabolic drug interactions are not \nanticipated, and decitabine is unlikely to interact with agents metabolized through these pathways. In \naddition, in vitro data show that decitabine is a poor P-gp substrate.\n\nElimination\nMean plasma clearance following intravenous administration in cancer subjects was > 200 L/h with \nmoderate inter-subject variability (coefficient of variation [CV] is approximately 50%). Excretion of \nunchanged drug appears to play only a minor role in the elimination of decitabine.\n\nResults from a mass balance study with radioactive 14C-decitabine in cancer patients showed that 90% \nof the administered dose of decitabine (4% unchanged drug) is excreted in the urine.\n\nAdditional information on special populations\nThe effects of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, age or race on the pharmacokinetics of decitabine \nhave not been formally studied. Information on special populations was derived from pharmacokinetic \ndata from the 3 studies noted above, and from one Phase I study in MDS subjects, (N = 14; \n15 mg/m2 x 3-hours q8h x 3 days).\n\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that decitabine pharmacokinetics are not dependent on \nage (range studied 40 to 87 years; median 70 years).\n\nPaediatric population\nPopulation PK analysis of decitabine showed that after accounting for body size, there is no difference \nbetween decitabine PK parameters in paediatric AML patients versus adults with AML or MDS.\n\nGender\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of decitabine did not show any clinically relevant difference \nbetween men and women.\n\nRace\nMost of the patients studied were Caucasian. However, the population pharmacokinetic analysis of \ndecitabine indicated that race had no apparent effect on the exposure to decitabine.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Results from \na human mass-balance study and in vitro experiments mentioned above indicated that the CYP \nenzymes are unlikely to be involved in the metabolism of decitabine. In addition, the limited data from \n\n\n\n13\n\nthe population PK analysis indicated no significant PK parameter dependencies on total bilirubin \nconcentration despite a wide range of total bilirubin levels. Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to \nbe affected in patients with impaired hepatic function.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with renal insufficiency. The \npopulation PK analysis on the limited decitabine data indicated no significant PK parameter \ndependencies on normalized creatinine clearance, an indicator of renal function. Thus, decitabine \nexposure is not likely to be affected in patients with impaired renal function.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with decitabine. Evidence from the literature \nindicates that decitabine has carcinogenic potential. The available data from in vitro and in vivo studies \nprovide sufficient evidence that decitabine has genotoxic potential. Data from the literature also \nindicate that decitabine has adverse effects on all aspects of the reproductive cycle, including fertility, \nembryo-foetal development and post-natal development. Multi-cycle repeat-dose toxicity studies in \nrats and rabbits indicated that the primary toxicity was myelosuppression, including effects on bone \nmarrow, which was reversible on cessation of treatment. Gastrointestinal toxicity was also observed \nand in males, testicular atrophy which did not reverse over the scheduled recovery periods. Decitabine \nadministration to neonatal/juvenile rats showed a comparable general toxicity profile as in older rats. \nNeurobehavioural development and reproductive capacity were unaffected when neonatal/juvenile rats \nwere treated at dose levels inducing myelosuppression.

What Dacogen is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Dacogen is\nDacogen is an anti-cancer medicine. It contains the active substance ‘decitabine’.\n\nWhat Dacogen is used for\nDacogen is used to treat a type of cancer called ‘acute myeloid leukaemia’ or ‘AML’. This is a type of \ncancer that affects your blood cells. You will be given Dacogen when you are first diagnosed with \nAML. It is used in adults.\n\nHow Dacogen works\nDacogen works by stopping cancer cells from growing. It also kills cancer cells.\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Dacogen works or why this \nmedicine has been prescribed for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Dacogen\n\nDo not use Dacogen:\n if you are allergic to decitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n if you are breast-feeding.\nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Dacogen.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dacogen if you have\n low numbers of platelets, red blood cells or white blood cells,\n an infection,\n liver disease,\n a serious kidney disorder,\n a heart disorder.\n\n\n\n24\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Dacogen.\n\nTests or checks\nYou will have blood tests before you start treatment with Dacogen and at the start of each treatment \ncycle.
