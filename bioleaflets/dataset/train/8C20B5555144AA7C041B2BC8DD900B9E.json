PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nThe product is a freeze-dried white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSYLVANT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease \n(MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) \nnegative. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis medicinal product should be administered by qualified healthcare professionals and under \nappropriate medical supervision. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 11 mg/kg siltuximab given over 1 hour as an intravenous infusion \nadministered every 3 weeks until treatment failure. \n \nTreatment criteria \nHaematology laboratory tests should be performed prior to each dose of SYLVANT therapy for the \nfirst 12 months and every third dosing cycle thereafter. Before administering the infusion, the \nprescriber should consider delaying treatment, if the treatment criteria outlined in Table 1 are not met. \nDose reduction is not recommended. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTable 1: Treatment criteria \nLaboratory parameter Requirements before first \n\nSYLVANT administration \nRetreatment criteria \n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.0 x 109/L \u2265 1.0 x 109/L \nPlatelet count \u2265 75 x 109/L \u2265 50 x 109/L \nHaemoglobina < 170 g/L (10.6 mmol/L) < 170 g/L (10.6 mmol/L) \na SYLVANT may increase haemoglobin levels in MCD patients \n\n \nThe SYLVANT therapy should be withheld if the patient has a severe infection or any severe \nnon-haematological toxicity and can be restarted at the same dose after recovery. \n \nIf the patient develops a severe infusion related reaction, anaphylaxis, severe allergic reaction, or \ncytokine release syndrome related to the infusion, further administration of SYLVANT should be \ndiscontinued. Discontinuing the medicinal product should be considered if there are more than 2 dose \ndelays due to toxicities related to the treatment during the first 48 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nNo major age-related differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) or in safety profile were observed in \nclinical studies. No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to investigate the PK of siltuximab in patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of siltuximab in children aged 17 years and younger have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSiltuximab must be administered as an intravenous infusion. \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nConcurrent active serious infections \nInfections, including localised infections, should be treated prior to administration of SYLVANT. \nSerious infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, were observed during clinical studies (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHypoglobulinaemia was observed in 4 to 11.3% of patients in the clinical study. \nDecreases in total IgG, IgA, or IgM levels below normal were observed in the range of 4 to 11% \npatients in the MCD trial (Study 1). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAll clinical studies with SYLVANT excluded patients with clinically significant infections, including \nthose known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Two cases of reactivated hepatitis B have been \nreported when SYLVANT was administered concomitantly with high dose dexamethasone, and \nbortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients. \n \nSYLVANT may mask signs and symptoms of acute inflammation including suppression of fever and \nof acute-phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Therefore, prescribers should diligently \nmonitor patients receiving treatment in order to detect serious infections. \n \nVaccinations \nLive, attentuated vaccines should not be given concurrently or within 4 weeks before initiating \nSYLVANT as clinical safety has not been established. \n \nLipid parameters \nElevations in triglycerides and cholesterol (lipid parameters) were observed in patients treated with \nSYLVANT (see section 4.8). Patients should be managed according to current clinical guidelines for \nmanagement of hyperlipidaemia. \n \nInfusion related reactions and hypersensitivity \nDuring intravenous infusion of SYLVANT, mild to moderate infusion reactions may improve \nfollowing slowing of or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of the reaction, reinitiating the infusion \nat a lower infusion rate and therapeutic administration of antihistamines, acetaminophen, and \ncorticosteroids may be considered. For patients who do not tolerate the infusion following these \ninterventions, SYLVANT should be discontinued. During or following infusion, treatment should be \ndiscontinued in patients who have severe infusion related hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., \nanaphylaxis). The management of severe infusion reactions should be dictated by the signs and \nsymptoms of the reaction. Appropriate personnel and medicinal product should be available to treat \nanaphylaxis if it occurs (see section 4.8). \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited \nexperience with siltuximab the present data do not suggest any increased risk of malignancy. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been reported in siltuximab clinical trials although not in MCD \ntrials. Use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for GI perforation. Promptly evaluate \npatients presenting with symptoms that may be associated with or suggestive of GI perforation. \n \nHepatic impairment \nFollowing treatment with SYLVANT  in clinical trials, transient or intermittent mild-to-moderate \nelevation of hepatic transaminase levels or other liver function tests such as bilirubin have been \nreported. SYLVANT-treated patients with known hepatic impairment as well as patients with elevated \ntransaminase or bilirubin levels should be monitored. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIn non-clinical studies, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is known to decrease the activity of cytochrome P450 \n(CYP450). Binding bioactive IL-6 by siltuximab may result in increased metabolism of CYP450 \nsubstrates, because CYP450 enzyme activity will normalise. Therefore, administering siltuximab with \nCYP450 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index has the potential to change therapeutic effects \nand toxicity of these medicinal products due to alteration in the CYP450 pathways. Upon initation or \ndiscontinuation of siltuximab in patients being treated with concomitant medicinal products that are \nCYP450 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or \nconcentration of medicinal product (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended. The dose of \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthe concomitant medicinal products should be adjusted as needed. The effect of siltuximab on \nCYP450 enzyme activity can persist for several weeks after stopping therapy. Prescribers should also \nexercise caution when siltuximab is co-administered with medicinal products that are CYP3A4 \nsubstrates where a decrease in effectiveness would be undesirable (e.g., oral contraceptives). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo interaction studies have been performed in this population. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment (see section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of siltuximab in pregnant women. Studies in animals with siltuximab \nhave shown no adverse effect on pregnancy or on embryofetal development (see section 5.3). \nSiltuximab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nSiltuximab should be given to a pregnant woman only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. \n \nAs with other immunoglobulin G antibodies, siltuximab crosses the placenta as observed in studies in \nmonkeys. Consequently, infants born to women treated with siltuximab may be at increased risk of \ninfection, and caution is advised in the administration of live vaccines to these infants (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether siltuximab is excreted in human milk. \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from siltuximab \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \nEffects of siltuximab on fertility have not been evaluated in humans. Available non-clinical data do \nnot suggest an effect on fertility under siltuximab treatment (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSiltuximab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nInfections (including upper respiratory tract infections), pruritus, rash, arthralgia, and diarrhoea were \nthe most common adverse reactions , occurring in > 20% of siltuximab-treated patients in Castleman\u2019s \ndisease (CD) clinical studies. The most serious adverse reaction associated with the use of siltuximab \nwas anaphylactic reaction. \n \nData from all patients treated with siltuximab monotherapy (n = 370) form the overall basis of the \nsafety evaluation. \nTable 2 reflects the frequencies of identified adverse reactions in the 87 MCD patients (Study 1, \nStudy 2 and Study 3) treated at the recommended dosage of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks (details provided \nin section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 lists adverse reactions observed in MCD patients treated with siltuximab at the recommended \ndosage of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Within the system organ class, adverse reactions are listed under \nheadings of frequency using the following categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1000 and <1/100); rare (\u22651/10000 and <1/1000); very rare (<1/10000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions in siltuximab treated patients in MCD clinical studiesa \nSystem organ class \nFrequency \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations \nvery common Upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract \n\ninfection, nasopharyngitis  \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nvery common Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia \nImmune system disorders \ncommon Anaphylactic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nvery common Hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperuricaemia \ncommon Hypercholesterolaemia \nNervous system disorders \nvery common Dizziness, headache \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nvery common Oropharyngeal pain \nVascular disorders \nvery common Hypertension \nGastointestinal disorders \nvery common Nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, \n\ndiarrhoea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, \nmouth ulceration \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nvery common Rash, pruritus, eczema \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nvery common Arthralgia, pain in extremity \nRenal and urinary disorders \nvery common Renal impairment \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nvery common Localised oedema \nInvestigations \nvery common Weight increased \na All patients with CD treated with siltuximab at recommended dose of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks [including crossover \n\npatients (N = 87)] \n \nInfusion related reactions and hypersensitivity \nIn clinical studies, siltuximab was associated with an infusion related reaction or hypersensitivity \nreaction in 5.1% (severe reaction in 0.8%) of patients treated with siltuximab monotherapy. \n \nIn long-term treatment of MCD patients with siltuximab at the recommended dosage of 11 mg/kg \nevery 3 weeks, infusion related reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occurred at a frequency of 6.3% \n(1.3% for severe reactions). \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported in clinical trials.  In the event of an overdose, the patient should \nbe monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment \nshould be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppresants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC11. \n \nMechanism of action \nSiltuximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that forms high affinity, stable \ncomplexes with soluble bioactive forms of human IL-6. Siltuximab prevents the binding of human \nIL-6 to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R), thus inhibiting the formation of the \nhexameric signaling complex with gp130 on the cell surface. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic \npro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T-cells and B-cells, \nlymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts, as well as malignant cells. IL-6 has been shown to be \ninvolved in diverse normal physiologic processes such as induction of immunoglobulin secretion, \ninitiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell \nproliferation and differentiation. Overproduction of IL-6, in chronic inflammatory diseases and \nmalignancies has been linked to anaemia and cachexia and has been hypothesised to play a central role \nin driving plasma cell proliferation and systemic manifestations in patients with CD. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn vitro, siltuximab dose-dependently inhibited the growth of an IL-6-dependent murine plasmacytoma \ncell line in response to human IL-6. In cultures of human hepatoma cells, IL-6-stimulated production \nof the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A was dose-dependently inhibited by siltuximab. Similarly, \nin cultures of human Burkitt\u2019s B-lymphoma cells, the production of immunoglobulin M protein in \nresponse to IL-6 was dose-dependently inhibited by siltuximab. \n \nBiomarkers \nIt is well established that IL-6 stimulates the acute-phase expression of C-reactive protein (CRP). The \nmechanism of action of siltuximab is neutralisation of IL-6 bioactivity, which can be measured \nindirectly by suppression of CRP. Siltuximab treatment in MCD results in rapid and sustained \ndecreases in CRP serum concentrations. Measurement of IL-6 concentrations in serum or plasma \nduring treatment should not be used as a pharmacodynamic marker, as siltuximab-neutralised \nantibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nStudy 1 \nA Phase 2, multinational, randomised (2:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to \nassess the efficacy and safety of siltuximab (11 mg/kg every 3 weeks) compared with placebo in \ncombination with best supportive care in patients with MCD. Treatment was continued until treatment \nfailure (defined as disease progression based on increase in symptoms, radiologic progression or \ndeterioration in performance status) or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 79 patients with symptomatic \nMCD were randomised and treated. Median age was 47 years (range 20-74) in the siltuximab arm and \n48 years (range 27-78) in the placebo arm. More male patients were enrolled in the placebo arm (85% \nin placebo vs. 56% in the siltuximab group). ECOG performance status score (0/1/2) at baseline was \n42%/45%/13% in the siltuximab arm and 39%/62%/0% in the placebo arm, respectively. At baseline, \n55% of patients in the siltuximab arm and 65% of patients in the placebo arm had received prior \nsystemic therapies for MCD and 30% of patients in the siltuximab arm and 31% in the placebo arm \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nwere using corticosteroids. Histological subtype was similar in both treatment arms, with 33% hyaline \nvascular subtype, 23% plasmacytic subtype and 44% mixed subtype. \nThe primary endpoint of the study was durable tumour and symptomatic response, defined as tumour \nresponse assessed by independent review and complete resolution or stabilisation of prospectively \ncollected MCD symptoms, for at least 18 weeks without treatment failure. \n \nIn Study 1 a statistically significant difference in independently reviewed durable tumour and \nsymptomatic response rate in the siltuximab arm compared with the placebo arm (34% vs. 0%, \nrespectively; 95% CI: 11.1, 54.8; p = 0.0012) was observed. The overall tumour response rate was \nevaluated based on modified Cheson criteria both by independent review and investigator assessment. \n \nKey efficacy results from Study 1 are summarised in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Efficacy endpoints from study 1 \nEfficacy endpoints Siltuximab+BSC* Placebo+BSC P-valuea \nPrimary efficacy endpoint \nDurable tumour & symptomatic response \n(independent review) 18/53 (34.0%) 0/26 (0%) 0.0012 \n\nSecondary efficacy endpoints \nDurable tumour & symptomatic response \n(investigator review) 24/53 (45.3%) 0/26 (0%) < 0.0001 \n\nBest tumour response (independent review) 20/53 (37.7%) 1/26 (3.8%) 0.0022 \nBest tumour response (investigator assessment) 27/53 (50.9%) 0/26 (0%) < 0.0001 \n\nTime to treatment failure Not reached 134 days 0.0084; HR 0.418 \nHaemoglobin increase > 15 g/L (0.9 mmol/L) \nat Week 13/haemoglobin response-evaluable \npopulation \n\n19/31 (61.3%) 0/11 (0%) 0.0002 \n\nDuration of tumour & symptomatic response \n(days) - independent review; median (min, \nmax) \n\n340 (55, 676)b N/Ac N/A \n\nDurable complete symptomatic responsed 13/53 (24.5%) 0/26 (0%) 0.0037 \nDuration of durable complete symptomatic \nresponse (days) median (min, max) 472 (169, 762)\n\ne N/A N/A \n* Best Supportive Care \na Adjusted for corticosteroid use at randomisation \nb At the time of primary analysis data for 19 of 20 tumour and symptomatic responders were censored due to on-going \n\nresponse \nc N/A = \u201cNot applicable\u201d, there were no responders in the placebo arm, therefore, duration is not applicable \nd Complete symptomatic response is defined as a 100% reduction in the baseline MCD overall symptom score sustained \n\nfor at least 18 weeks prior to treatment failure \ne Data from 11 of 13 complete symptomatic responders were censored due to on-going response \n\n \nMCD-related signs and symptoms were prospectively collected. A total score of all symptoms \n(referred to as the MCD-related Overall Symptom Score) is the sum of the severity grades \n(NCI-CTCAE grade) of the MCD-related signs and symptoms [general MCD-related (fatigue, \nmalaise, hyperhidrosis, night sweats, fever, weight loss, anorexia, tumour pain, dyspnea, and pruritus), \nautoimmune phenomena, fluid retention, neuropathy, and skin disorders]. The percent change from \nbaseline in MCD-related signs and symptoms and MCD-related overall symptom score at each cycle \nwas calculated. Complete symptom response was defined as a 100% reduction from the baseline \noverall in the MCD-related overall symptom score sustained for at least 18 weeks prior to treatment \nfailure. \nHaemoglobin response was defined as a change from baseline of \u2265 15 g/L (0.9 mmol/L) at Week 13. \nA statistically significant difference (61.3% vs. 0% respectively; p = 0.0002) in the haemoglobin \nresponse in the siltuximab arm compared with the placebo arm was observed. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSubgroup analyses \nAnalyses for both primary and secondary endpoints on various subgroups including age (< 65 years \nand \u2265 65 years); race (White and Non-White); region (North America, Europe, Middle East and \nAfrica, and Asia Pacific); baseline corticosteroid use (yes and no); prior therapy (yes and no); and \nMCD histology (plasmatic and mixed histology) consistently showed that the treatment effect \nfavoured the siltuximab arm except for the hyaline vascular subgroup in which no patient achieved the \ndefinition of the primary endpoint. A consistent treatment effect favouring siltuximab treated patients \nacross all major secondary endpoints was shown in the hyaline vascular subgroup.

In this study 37 patients with CD (35 MCD patients) were treated with siltuximab. In the \n16 patients with MCD treated with 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks, overall tumour response rate by \nindependent review was 43.8% with 6.3% complete response. All tumour responses were durable for \n> 18 weeks. In this study, 16 of the 35 MCD patients were hyaline vascular subtype; 31% of these \npatients had a radiologic response based on independent review and 88% showed clinical benefit \nresponse as defined in the protocol. \n \nStudy 3 \nAn open-label, multicentre, non-randomised Phase 2 study assessed the safety and efficacy of \nextended treatment with siltuximab in 60 patients with MCD who were previously enrolled in Study 1 \n(41 patients) or Study 2 (19 patients). Median duration of siltuximab treatment was 5.52 years \n(range: 0.8 to 10.8 years); more than 50% of patients received siltuximab treatment for \u22655 years. After \na median of 6 years of follow-up, none of the 60 patients had died and maintenance of disease control \nwas demonstrated in 58 of 60 patients. \n \nHighest total dose in clinical trials \nThe highest total amount of siltuximab administered in any clinical trial so far per dose was 2,190 mg \n(11 mg/kg). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nsiltuximab in all subsets of the paediatric population in CD (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing the first administration of siltuximab (doses ranging from 0.9 to 15 mg/kg), the area under \nthe concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal serum concentration (Cmax) increased in a \ndose-proportional manner and clearance (CL) was independent of dose. Following the single dose \nadministration at the recommended dose regimen (11 mg/kg given once every 3 weeks), the clearance \nwas 3.54 \u00b1 0.44 mL/kg/day and half-life was 16.3 \u00b1 4.2 days. Following the repeat dose administration \nat the recommended dose, siltuximab clearance was found to be time-invariant, and systemic \naccumulation was moderate (accumulation index of 1.7). Consistent with half-life after the first dose, \nserum concentrations reached steady-state levels by the sixth infusion (intervals every 3 weeks) with \nmean (\u00b1 SD) peak and trough concentrations of 332 \u00b1 139 and 84 \u00b1 66 mcg/mL, respectively. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for the generation of anti-medicine antibodies \n(immunogenicity). The immunogenicity of siltuximab has been evaluated using antigen-bridging \nenzyme immunoassay (EIA) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay (ECLIA) \nmethods. \n \nIn clinical studies including monotherapy and combination studies, samples from a total of \n432 patients were available for anti-siltuximab antibody testing with 189 patients having at least one \nsample tested with the high medicinal product-tolerant ECLIA assay. The incidence rate of detectable \nanti-siltuximab antibodies was 0.9% (4/432) overall and 2.1% (4/189) in patients with at least once \nsample tested with the high medicinal product tolerant ECLIA assay. Further immunogenicity \nanalyses were conducted for all positive samples from the 4 patients with detectable anti-siltuximab \nantibodies. None of these patients had neutralising antibodies. No evidence of altered safety or \nefficacy was identified in the patients who developed antibodies to siltuximab. \n \nSpecial populations \nCross-study population PK analyses were performed using data from 378 patients with a variety of \nconditions who received single-agent siltuximab at doses ranging from 0.9 to 15 mg/kg. The effects of \nvarious covariates on siltuximab PK were assessed in the analyses. \n \nSiltuximab clearance increased with increasing body weight; however, no dose adjustment is required \nfor body weight since administration is on an mg/kg basis. The following factors had no clinical effect \non the clearance of siltuximab: gender, age, and ethnicity. The effect of anti-siltuximab antibody status \nwas not examined, as there were insufficient numbers of anti-siltuximab antibody positive patients. \n \nElderly \nThe population PK of siltuximab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics. \nThe results showed no significant difference in the PK of siltuximab in patients older than 65 years \ncompared to patients age 65 years or younger. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of siltuximab has been \nconducted. For patients with baseline calculated creatinine clearance of 12 mL/min or greater, there \nwas no meaningful effect on siltuximab PK. Four patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 12 to 30 mL/min) were included in the data set. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of siltuximab has been \nconducted. For patients with baseline alanine transaminase up to 3.7 times the upper limit of normal \n\n\n\n11 \n\nbaseline albumin ranging from 15 to 58 g/L, and baseline bilirubin ranging from 1.7 to 42.8 mg/dL \nthere was no meaningful effect on siltuximab PK. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of siltuximab have not been established in paediatric patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in young cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 9.2 and \n46 mg/kg/week (up to 22-fold greater exposure than in patients receiving 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks) \nwith siltuximab showed no signs indicative of toxicity. A slight reduction in T-cell dependent antibody \nresponse and a reduction in the size of the splenic germinal centers following Keyhole limpet \nhemocyanin (KLH) immunisation was observed which were considered to be pharmacological \nresponses of IL-6 inhibition and not of toxicological significance. \n \nSiltuximab (9.2 and 46 mg/kg/week) did not produce any toxicity of the reproductive tract in \ncynomolgus monkeys. In mice dosed subcutaneously with an anti-mouse IL-6 monoclonal antibody, \nno effects on male or female fertility were observed. \n \nDuring an embryo-fetal development study where siltuximab was administered intravenously to \npregnant cynomolgus monkeys (gestation day 20 \u2013 118) at doses of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg/week, no \nmaternal or fetal toxicity was observed. Siltuximab crossed the placenta during gestation whereby fetal \nserum concentrations of siltuximab at gestation day (GD) 140 were similar to maternal concentrations. \nHistopathological examination of lymphoid tissues from GD140 fetuses showed no morphological \nabnormalities in the development of the immune system. \n \nRodent carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with siltuximab. Evidence from studies \nconducted with siltuximab and other IL-6 inhibitors suggest that the potential for siltuximab to cause \ncarcinogenicity is low. However, there is also evidence to suggest that IL-6 inhibition may suppress \nimmune responses, immune surveillance and lower defense against established tumours. Therefore, an \nincreased susceptibility to specific tumours cannot be entirely ruled out. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What SYLVANT is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given SYLVANT \n3. How SYLVANT is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SYLVANT \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What SYLVANT is and what it is used for \n \nWhat SYLVANT is \nSYLVANT is a medicine that contains the active substance siltuximab. \nSiltuximab is a monoclonal antibody (a specialised type of protein) that binds selectively to an antigen \n(a target protein) in the body called interleukin-6 (IL-6). \n \nWhat SYLVANT is used for \nSYLVANT is used to treat multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease (MCD) in adult patients who do not have \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. \nMulticentric Castleman\u2019s disease causes benign tumours (non-cancerous growths) to develop in the \nlymph nodes in the body. Symptoms of this disease may include feeling tired, sweating at night, \nhaving a tingling feeling, and loss of appetite. \n \nHow SYLVANT works \nPatients with MCD produce too much IL-6 and this is thought to contribute to the abnormal growth of \ncertain cells in lymph nodes. By binding to IL-6, siltuximab blocks its activity and stops abnormal cell \ngrowth. This helps reduce the size of the affected lymph nodes, which reduces the symptoms of the \nillness and should help you carry out your normal daily tasks. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given SYLVANT \n \nYou should not be given SYLVANT if: \nYou are severely allergic to siltuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given SYLVANT if: \n\u2022 you have an infection at the moment \u2013 this is because SYLVANT may lower your ability to feel \n\nor fight infections, and infections may get worse. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\u2022 you are due to have a vaccination or may need to have one in the near future \u2013 this is because \nsome vaccines should not be given with SYLVANT. \n\n\u2022 you have high level of fats in your blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) \u2013 this is because SYLVANT \nmay increase these levels. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to correct this. \n\n\u2022 you have a condition such as stomach ulcer or diverticulitis that may increase the risk of getting \na tear in the stomach or gut (gastrointestinal perforation). Signs of such a tear developing \ninclude stomach pain getting worse, feeling sick (nausea), change in bowel habits and fever \u2013 if \nyou get any of these, contact your doctor right away. \n\n\u2022 you have liver disease or changes that show up in blood tests of the liver. Your doctor will \nmonitor you and your liver function. \n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before \nyou are given SYLVANT. \n \nAllergic reactions \nTell your doctor straight away if you have a severe allergic reaction during or after the infusion. Signs \ninclude: difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-headedness, swelling \nof the lips or skin rash. \n \nInfections \nYou may be more likely to get infections while you are being treated with SYLVANT. \nThese infections may be serious, such as pneumonia or blood poisoning (also called \u201csepsis\u201d). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you get any signs of infection during treatment with SYLVANT. \nSigns include: cough, flu-like symptoms, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, fever. Your doctor may stop \nyour treatment with SYLVANT straight away. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIt is not known if SYLVANT is safe and effective in this population, therefore SYLVANT should not \nbe given to children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and SYLVANT \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 theophylline, used to treat asthma \n\u2022 warfarin, a blood thinner \n\u2022 cyclosporin, used during and after organ transplants \n\u2022 oral contraceptives, used to prevent pregnancy. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are \ngiven SYLVANT. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\u2022 SYLVANT is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It is not known if SYLVANT may \n\naffect the baby or a pregnant or breast-feeding woman. \n\u2022 You must not become pregnant while you are being treated with SYLVANT and for 3 months \n\nafter your treatment has finished. You should use effective methods of contraception during this \ntime. \n\n\u2022 In some cases, if you are pregnant and need treatment for MCD, your doctor may advise that the \nbenefit of taking SYLVANT for your health outweighs the possible risks to your unborn baby, \nincluding increased risk of infection and use of certain vaccines in babies born to mothers \nexposed to SYLVANT while pregnant. \n\n\u2022  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\u2022 It is not known if. SYLVANT passes into breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you \nwill continue to take SYLVANT, or breast-feed and discontinue SYLVANT. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nSYLVANT is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle, or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How SYLVANT is given \n \nSYLVANT will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, in a hospital or clinic only. \n\u2022 The recommended dose is 11 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, given once every \n\n3 weeks. \n\u2022 SYLVANT will be given as an \u201cintravenous infusion\u201d (a drip into a vein, usually in your arm). \n\u2022 It will be given slowly over a period of 1 hour. \n\u2022 During the infusion with SYLVANT, you will be monitored for side effects. \n\u2022 You will receive treatment until you and your doctor agree that you will no longer benefit from \n\nthe treatment. \n \nIf you are given more SYLVANT than you should \nAs this medicine will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too \nmuch. If you think you have been given too much SYLVANT, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. \nIt is not known what the possible side effects could be from having too much SYLVANT. \n \nIf you stop treatment with SYLVANT \nYou should not stop using SYLVANT without discussing with your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine. \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice the following side effects, as he or she may need to \nstop your treatment: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 severe allergic reaction \u2013 the signs may include: difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, \n\nsevere dizziness or light-headedness, swelling of the lips or skin rash. \n \nOther side effects include: \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 drop in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) \n\u2022 drop in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) \n\u2022 itching \n\u2022 rash, itchy skin rash (eczema) \n\u2022 high fat levels in your blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) \n\u2022 high level of 'uric acid' in the blood, which may cause gout \n\u2022 abnormal kidney function test \n\u2022 swelling in the arms, legs, neck or face \n\u2022 high blood pressure \n\u2022 respiratory infections \u2013 such as of the nose, sinuses or throat \n\u2022 urinary tract infection \n\u2022 common cold \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\u2022 sore throat \n\u2022 stomach pain or discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea, heartburn, ulcers (sores) in the mouth, \n\nnausea, vomiting \n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 joint pain, arm or leg pain \n\u2022 weight gain. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 high level of cholesterol in the blood \n \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What SYLVANT is and what it is used for \n \nWhat SYLVANT is \nSYLVANT is a medicine that contains the active substance siltuximab. \nSiltuximab is a monoclonal antibody (a specialised type of protein) that binds selectively to an antigen \n(a target protein) in the body called interleukin-6 (IL-6). \n \nWhat SYLVANT is used for \nSYLVANT is used to treat multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease (MCD) in adult patients who do not have \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. \nMulticentric Castleman\u2019s disease causes benign tumours (non-cancerous growths) to develop in the \nlymph nodes in the body. Symptoms of this disease may include feeling tired, sweating at night, \nhaving a tingling feeling, and loss of appetite. \n \nHow SYLVANT works \nPatients with MCD produce too much IL-6 and this is thought to contribute to the abnormal growth of \ncertain cells in lymph nodes. By binding to IL-6, siltuximab blocks its activity and stops abnormal cell \ngrowth. This helps reduce the size of the affected lymph nodes, which reduces the symptoms of the \nillness and should help you carry out your normal daily tasks. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given SYLVANT \n \nYou should not be given SYLVANT if: \nYou are severely allergic to siltuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given SYLVANT if: \n\u2022 you have an infection at the moment \u2013 this is because SYLVANT may lower your ability to feel \n\nor fight infections, and infections may get worse. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\u2022 you are due to have a vaccination or may need to have one in the near future \u2013 this is because \nsome vaccines should not be given with SYLVANT. \n\n\u2022 you have high level of fats in your blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) \u2013 this is because SYLVANT \nmay increase these levels. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to correct this. \n\n\u2022 you have a condition such as stomach ulcer or diverticulitis that may increase the risk of getting \na tear in the stomach or gut (gastrointestinal perforation). Signs of such a tear developing \ninclude stomach pain getting worse, feeling sick (nausea), change in bowel habits and fever \u2013 if \nyou get any of these, contact your doctor right away. \n\n\u2022 you have liver disease or changes that show up in blood tests of the liver. Your doctor will \nmonitor you and your liver function.  \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before \nyou are given SYLVANT. \n \nAllergic reactions \nTell your doctor straight away if you have a severe allergic reaction during or after the infusion. Signs \ninclude: difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-headedness, swelling \nof the lips or skin rash. \n \nInfections \nYou may be more likely to get infections while you are being treated with SYLVANT. \nThese infections may be serious, such as pneumonia or blood poisoning (also called \u201csepsis\u201d). \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you get any signs of infection during treatment with SYLVANT. \nSigns include: cough, flu-like symptoms, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, fever. Your doctor may stop \nyour treatment with SYLVANT straight away. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIt is not known if SYLVANT is safe and effective in this population, therefore SYLVANT should not \nbe given to children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and SYLVANT \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 theophylline, used to treat asthma \n\u2022 warfarin, a blood thinner \n\u2022 cyclosporin, used during and after organ transplants \n\u2022 oral contraceptives, used to prevent pregnancy. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are \ngiven SYLVANT. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\u2022 SYLVANT is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It is not known if SYLVANT may \n\naffect the baby or a pregnant or breast-feeding woman. \n\u2022 You must not become  pregnant while you are being treated with SYLVANT and for 3 months \n\nafter your treatment has finished. You should use effective methods of contraception during this \ntime. \n\n\u2022 In some cases, if you are pregnant and need treatment for MCD, your doctor may advise that the \nbenefit of taking SYLVANT for your health outweighs the possible risks to your unborn baby, \nincluding increased risk of infection and use of certain vaccines in babies born to mothers \nexposed to SYLVANT while pregnant. \n\n\u2022  \n\u2022 It is not known if. SYLVANT passes into breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you \n\nwill continue to take SYLVANT, or breast-feed and discontinue SYLVANT. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nSYLVANT is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle, or use any tools or machines. \n \n \n3. How SYLVANT is given \n \nSYLVANT will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, in a hospital or clinic only. \n\u2022 The recommended dose is 11 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, given once every \n\n3 weeks. \n\u2022 SYLVANT will be given as an \u201cintravenous infusion\u201d (a drip into a vein, usually in your arm). \n\u2022 It will be given slowly over a period of 1 hour. \n\u2022 During the infusion with SYLVANT, you will be monitored for side effects. \n\u2022 You will receive treatment until you and your doctor agree that you will no longer benefit from \n\nthe treatment. \n \nIf you are given more SYLVANT than you should \nAs this medicine will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too \nmuch. If you think you have been given too much SYLVANT, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. \nIt is not known what the possible side effects could be from having too much SYLVANT. \n \nIf you stop treatment with SYLVANT \nYou should not stop using SYLVANT without discussing with your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Use aseptic technique. \n2. Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted SYLVANT solution required and the number \n\nof vials needed. The recommended needle for preparation is 21-gauge 1\u00bd inch (38 mm). \nInfusion bags (250 mL) must contain Dextrose 5% and must be made of polyvinyl chloride \n(PVC), or polyolefin (PO), or polypropylene (PP), or polyethylene (PE). Alternatively PE \nbottles may be used. \n\n3. Allow vial(s) of SYLVANT to come to room temperature (15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) over approximately \n30 minutes. SYLVANT should remain at room temperature for the duration of the preparation. \nEach vial should be reconstituted with 20.0 mL of single-use water for injections to yield a \n20 mg/mL solution. \n\n4. Gently swirl (DO NOT SHAKE OR VORTEX OR SWIRL VIGOROUSLY) the reconstituted \nvials to aid the dissolution of the powder. Do not remove contents until all of the powder has \nbeen completely dissolved. The powder should dissolve in less than 60 minutes. Inspect the \nvials for particulate matter and discolouration prior to dose preparation. Do not use if visibly \nopaque or if foreign particles and/or solution discolouration are present. \n\n5. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted solution dose to 250 mL with sterile Dextrose 5%, \nby withdrawing a volume equal to the volume of reconstituted SYLVANT from the Dextrose \n5%, 250 mL bag. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted SYLVANT solution to the \n250 mL infusion bag. Gently mix. \n\n6. The reconstituted solution should be kept for no more than 2 hours prior to addition into the \nintravenous bag. The infusion should be completed within 6 hours of the addition of the \nreconstituted solution to the infusion bag. Administer the diluted solution over a period of \n1 hour using administration sets lined with PVC, or polyurethane (PU), or PE, containing a \n0.2-micron inline polyethersulfone (PES) filter. SYLVANT does not contain preservatives; \ntherefore do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for re-use. \n\n7. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the \nco-administration of SYLVANT with other medicinal products. Do not infuse SYLVANT \nconcomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. \n\n8. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
