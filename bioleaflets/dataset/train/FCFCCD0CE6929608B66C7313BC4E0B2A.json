CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nImatinib Actavis is indicated for the treatment of \n- paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) \n\nchronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as \nthe first line of treatment. \n\n- paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or \nin accelerated phase or blast crisis. \n\n- adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. \n- adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. \n- adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. \n- adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with \n\nplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. \n- adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic \n\nleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 rearrangement. \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\nThe effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. \n \nImatinib Actavis is indicated for \n- the treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and \n\nadult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. \n \nIn adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on \nobjective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experience \nwith imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very \nlimited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased \nsurvival for these diseases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with \nhaematological malignancies and malignant sarcomas, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nPosology for CML in adult patients \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 600 mg/day for adult patients in blast crisis. Blast crisis is \ndefined as blasts \u2265 30% in blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than \nhepatosplenomegaly. \n \nTreatment duration: In clinical trials, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease progression. \nThe effect of stopping treatment after the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response has not \nbeen investigated. \n \nDose increases from 600 mg to a maximum of 800 mg (given as 400 mg twice daily) in patients with \nblast crisis may be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-\nleukaemia-related neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease \nprogression (at any time); failure to achieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least \n3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a cytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss \nof a previously achieved haematological and/or cytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored \nclosely following dose escalation given the potential for an increased incidence of adverse reactions at \nhigher dosages. \n \nPosology for CML in paediatric patients \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily \nis recommended for children with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML (not to exceed the \ntotal dose of 800 mg). Treatment can be given as a once daily dose or alternatively the daily dose may \nbe split into two administrations \u2013 one in the morning and one in the evening. The dose \nrecommendation is currently based on a small number of paediatric patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThere is no experience with the treatment of children below 2 years of age. \n \nDose increases from 340 mg/m2 daily to 570 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed the total dose of 800 mg) may \nbe considered in children in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-\nrelated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any \ntime); failure to achieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; \nfailure to achieve a cytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved \nhaematological and/or cytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose \nescalation given the potential for an increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in adult patients \n\n3 \n\n\n\nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 600 mg/day for adult patients with Ph+ ALL. Haematological \nexperts in the management of this disease should supervise the therapy throughout all phases of care. \n \nTreatment schedule: On the basis of the existing data, imatinib has been shown to be effective and safe \nwhen administered at 600 mg/day in combination with chemotherapy in the induction phase, the \nconsolidation and maintenance phases of chemotherapy (see section 5.1) for adult patients with newly \ndiagnosed Ph+ ALL. The duration of imatinib therapy can vary with the treatment programme \nselected, but generally longer exposures to imatinib have yielded better results. \n \nFor adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL imatinib monotherapy at 600 mg/day is safe, \neffective and can be given until disease progression occurs. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in paediatric patients \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily \nis recommended for children with Ph+ ALL (not to exceed the total dose of 600 mg). \n \nPosology for MDS/MPD \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 400 mg/day for adult patients with MDS/MPD. \n \nTreatment duration: In the only clinical trial performed up to now, treatment with imatinib was \ncontinued until disease progression (see section 5.1). At the time of analysis, the treatment \nduration was a median of 47 months (24 days - 60 months). \n \nPosology for HES/CEL \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 100 mg/day for adult patients with HES/CEL. \n \nDose increase from 100 mg to 400 mg may be considered in the absence of adverse drug reactions \nif assessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy. \n \nTreatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit.  \n \nPosology for DFSP \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 800 mg/day for adult patients with DFSP. \n \nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nNon-haematological adverse reactions \nIf a severe non-haematological adverse reaction develops with imatinib use, treatment must be \nwithheld until the event has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be resumed as appropriate depending \non the initial severity of the event. \n \nIf elevations in bilirubin > 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or in liver transaminases \n> 5 x IULN occur, imatinib should be withheld until bilirubin levels have returned to < 1.5 x IULN \nand transaminase levels to < 2.5 x IULN. Treatment with imatinib may then be continued at a reduced \ndaily dose. In adults the dose should be reduced from 400 to 300 mg or from 600 to 400 mg, or from \n800 mg to 600 mg, and in children from 340 to 260 mg/m2/day. \n \nHaematological adverse reactions \nDose reduction or treatment interruption for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are \nrecommended as indicated in the table below. \n \nDose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: \n \nHES/CEL (starting dose \n100 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction). \n\n4 \n\n\n\nMDS/MPD (starting dose \n400 mg) \nHES/CEL (at dose \n400 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L.  \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction).  \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of 300 mg.  \n\nPaediatric chronic phase \nCML (at dose \n340 mg/m2) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction). \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of \n260 mg/m2. \n\nCML in blast crisis and \nPh+ ALL (starting dose \n600 mg) \n\naANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/L \n\n1. Check whether cytopenia is related to \nleukaemia (marrow aspirate or \nbiopsy). \n\n2. If cytopenia is unrelated to leukaemia, \nreduce dose of imatinib to 400 mg. \n\n3. If cytopenia persists for 2 weeks, \nreduce further to 300 mg. \n\n4. If cytopenia persists for 4 weeks and \nis still unrelated to leukaemia, stop \nimatinib until ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and \nplatelets \u2265 20 x 109/L, then resume \ntreatment at 300 mg. \n\nPaediatric accelerated \nphase CML and blast \ncrisis (starting dose \n340 mg/m2) \n\naANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/L \n\n1. Check whether cytopenia is related to \nleukaemia (marrow aspirate or \nbiopsy). \n\n2. If cytopenia is unrelated to leukaemia, \nreduce dose of imatinib to 260 mg/m2. \n\n3. If cytopenia persists for 2 weeks, \nreduce further to 200 mg/m2. \n\n4. If cytopenia persists for 4 weeks and \nis still unrelated to leukaemia, stop \nimatinib until ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and \nplatelets \u2265 20 x 109/L, then resume \ntreatment at 200 mg/m2. \n\nDFSP (at dose 800 mg) ANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L.  \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \n600 mg.  \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of 400 mg.  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count \na occurring after at least 1 month of treatment \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n5 \n\n\n\nPaediatric use: There is no experience in children with CML below 2 years of age and with Ph+ALL \nbelow 1 year of age (see section 5.1).There is very limited experience in children with MDS/MPD, \nDFSP, and HES/CEL. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of imatinib in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL aged less than \n18 years of age have not been established in clinical trials. Currently available published data are \nsummarised in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nHepatic insufficiency: Imatinib is mainly metabolised through the liver. Patients with mild, moderate \nor severe liver dysfunction should be given the minimum recommended dose of 400 mg daily. The \ndose can be reduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nLiver dysfunction classification: \n \nLiver dysfunction Liver function tests \nMild Total bilirubin: = 1.5 ULN \n\nAST: >ULN (can be normal or <ULN if total bilirubin is >ULN) \nModerate Total bilirubin: >1.5-3.0 ULN \n\nAST: any \nSevere Total bilirubin: >3-10 ULN \n\nAST: any \nULN = upper limit of normal for the institution \nAST = aspartate aminotransferase \n \nRenal insufficiency: Patients with renal dysfunction or on dialysis should be given the minimum \nrecommended dose of 400 mg daily as starting dose. However, in these patients caution is \nrecommended. The dose can be reduced if not tolerated. If tolerated, the dose can be increased for lack \nof efficacy (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients: Imatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in older people. No \nsignificant age-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients in clinical \ntrials which included over 20% of patients age 65 and older. No specific dose recommendation is \nnecessary in older people. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prescribed dose should be administered orally with a meal and a large glass of water to minimise \nthe risk of gastrointestinal irritations. Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, \nwhereas a daily dose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day, in the morning and in \nthe evening.  \n \nFor patients (children) unable to swallow the capsules, their content may be diluted in a glass of either \nstill water or apple juice. Since studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, and the potential \nrisk for the human foetus is unknown, women of child-bearing potential who open capsules should be \nadvised to handle the contents with caution and avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation (see section 4.6). \nHands should be washed immediately after handling open capsules. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen imatinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, there is a potential for drug \ninteractions. Caution should be used when taking imatinib with protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \ncertain macrolides (see section 4.5), CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. \ncyclosporine, pimozide tacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, \n\n6 \n\n\n\nterfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel, quinidine) or warfarin and other coumarin derivatives (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of imatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. \nJohn\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of \ntherapeutic failure. Therefore, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n \nHypothyroidism \nClinical cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing \nlevothyroxine replacement during treatment with imatinib (see section 4.5). Thyroid stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels should be closely monitored in such patients. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nMetabolism of imatinib is mainly hepatic, and only 13% of excretion is through the kidneys. In \npatients with hepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate or severe), peripheral blood counts and liver \nenzymes should be carefully monitored (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). It should be noted that GIST \npatients may have hepatic metastases which could lead to hepatic impairment. \n \nCases of liver injury, including hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis, have been observed with imatinib. \nWhen imatinib is combined with high dose chemotherapy regimens, an increase in serious hepatic \nreactions has been detected. Hepatic function should be carefully monitored in circumstances where \nimatinib is combined with chemotherapy regimens also known to be associated with hepatic \ndysfunction (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nFluid retention \nOccurrences of severe fluid retention (pleural effusion, oedema, pulmonary oedema, ascites, \nsuperficial oedema) have been reported in approximately 2.5% of newly diagnosed CML patients \ntaking imatinib. Therefore, it is highly recommended that patients be weighed regularly. An \nunexpected rapid weight gain should be carefully investigated and if necessary appropriate supportive \ncare and therapeutic measures should be undertaken. In clinical trials, there was an increased incidence \nof these events in elderly patients and those with a prior history of cardiac disease. Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised in patients with cardiac dysfunction. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease \nPatients with cardiac disease, risk factors for cardiac failure or history of renal failure should be \nmonitored carefully, and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure \nshould be evaluated and treated. \n \nIn patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with occult infiltration of HES cells within the \nmyocardium, isolated cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated \nwith HES cell degranulation upon the initiation of imatinib therapy. The condition was reported to be \nreversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily \nwithholding imatinib. As cardiac adverse events have been reported uncommonly with imatinib, a \ncareful assessment of the benefit/risk of imatinib therapy should be considered in the HES/CEL \npopulation before treatment initiation. \n \nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases with PDGFR gene re-arrangements could be associated \nwith high eosinophil levels. Evaluation by a cardiology specialist, performance of an echocardiogram \nand determination of serum troponin should therefore be considered in patients with HES/CEL, and in \npatients with MDS/MPD associated with high eosinophil levels before imatinib is administered. If \neither is abnormal, follow-up with a cardiology specialist and the prophylactic use of systemic steroids \n(1-2 mg/kg) for one to two weeks concomitantly with imatinib should be considered at the initiation of \ntherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \n\n7 \n\n\n\nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, both gastrointestinal and \nintra-tumoural haemorrhages were reported (see section 4.8). Based on the available data, no \npredisposing factors (e.g. tumour size, tumour location, coagulation disorders) have been identified \nthat place patients with GIST at a higher risk of either type of haemorrhage. Since increased \nvascularity and propensity for bleeding is a part of the nature and clinical course of GIST, standard \npractices and procedures for the monitoring and management of haemorrhage in all patients should be \napplied. \nIn addition, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, has \nbeen reported in post-marketing experience in patients with CML, ALL and other diseases (see \nsection 4.8). When needed, discontinuation of imatinib treatment may be considered. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nDue to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant \ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of imatinib (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome.  \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imatinib Actavis. Experts \nin liver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in \npatients with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Imatinib \nActavis should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout \ntherapy and for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nPhototoxicity \nExposure to direct sunlight should be avoided or minimised due to the risk of phototoxicity associated \nwith imatinib treatment. Patients should be instructed to use measures such as protective clothing and \nsunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy \nBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy \n(TMA), including individual case reports for Imatinib Actavis (see section 4.8). If laboratory or \nclinical findings associated with TMA occur in a patient receiving Imatinib Actavis, treatment should \nbe discontinued and thorough evaluation for TMA, including ADAMTS13 activity and anti-\nADAMTS13-antibody determination, should be completed. If anti-ADAMTS13-antibody is elevated \nin conjunction with low ADAMTS13 activity, treatment with Imatinib Actavis should not be resumed. \n \nLaboratory tests \nComplete blood counts must be performed regularly during therapy with imatinib. Treatment of CML \npatients with imatinib has been associated with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. However, the \noccurrence of these cytopenias is likely to be related to the stage of the disease being treated and they \nwere more frequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis as compared to patients with \nchronic phase CML. Treatment with imatinib may be interrupted or the dose may be reduced, as \nrecommended in section 4.2. \n \nLiver function (transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored regularly in \npatients receiving imatinib. \n \nIn patients with impaired renal function, imatinib plasma exposure seems to be higher than that in \npatients with normal renal function, probably due to an elevated plasma level of alpha-acid \nglycoprotein (AGP), an imatinib-binding protein, in these patients. Patients with renal impairment \nshould be given the minimum starting dose. Patients with severe renal impairment should be treated \nwith caution. The dose can be reduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n8 \n\n\n\nLong-term treatment with imatinib may be associated with a clinically significant decline in renal \nfunction. Renal function should, therefore, be evaluated prior to the start of imatinib therapy and \nclosely monitored during therapy, with particular attention to those patients exhibiting risk factors for \nrenal dysfunction. If renal dysfunction is observed, appropriate management and treatment should be \nprescribed in accordance with standard treatment guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere have been case reports of growth retardation occurring in children and pre-adolescents receiving \nimatinib. In an observational study in the CML paediatric population, a statistically significant \ndecrease (but of uncertain clinical relevance) in median height standard deviation scores after 12 and \n24 months of treatment was reported in two small subsets irrespective of pubertal status or gender. \nClose monitoring of growth in children under imatinib treatment is recommended (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients(s) \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors \nsuch as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; azole \nantifungals including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such \nas erythromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib \nconcentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of \nimatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a \nsingle dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering \nimatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. \n \nActive substances that may decrease imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or Hypericum perforatum, also known as \nSt. John\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of \ntherapeutic failure. Pretreatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single \n400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC(0-\u221e) by at least 54% and 74%, of the \nrespective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with \nmalignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts (EIAEDs) such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for \nimatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or \nother strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. \n \nActive substances that may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib \nImatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, \nrespectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended \nwhen administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. \ncyclosporine, pimozide, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, \nterfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel and quinidine). Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of \nother CYP3A4 metabolised drugs (e.g. triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel \nblockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e. statins, etc.). \n \nBecause of known increased risks of bleeding in conjunction with the use of imatinib (e.g. \nhaemorrhage), patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight or standard \nheparin instead of coumarin derivatives such as warfarin. \n \n\n9 \n\n\n\nIn vitro imatinib inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at concentrations similar \nto those that affect CYP3A4 activity. Imatinib at 400 mg twice daily had an inhibitory effect on \nCYP2D6-mediated metoprolol metabolism, with metoprolol Cmax and AUC being increased by \napproximately 23% (90%CI [1.16-1.30]). Dose adjustments do not seem to be necessary when \nimatinib is co-administrated with CYP2D6 substrates, however caution is advised for CYP2D6 \nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic window such as metoprolol. In patients treated with metoprolol \nclinical monitoring should be considered. \n \nIn vitro, imatinib inhibits paracetamol O-glucuronidation with Ki value of 58.5 micromol/L. This \ninhibition has not been observed in vivo after the administration of imatinib 400 mg and \nparacetamol 1000 mg. Higher doses of imatinib and paracetamol have not been studied. \n \nCaution should therefore be exercised when using high doses of imatinib and paracetamol \nconcomitantly. \n \nIn thyroidectomy patients receiving levothyroxine, the plasma exposure to levothyroxine may be \ndecreased when imatinib is co-administered (see section 4.4). Caution is therefore recommended. \nHowever, the mechanism of the observed interaction is presently unknown. \n \nIn Ph+ ALL patients, there is clinical experience of co-administering imatinib with chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1), but drug-drug interactions between imatinib and chemotherapy regimens are not well \ncharacterised. Imatinib adverse events, i.e. hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression or others, may increase \nand it has been reported that concomitant use with L-asparaginase could be associated with increased \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.8). Therefore, the use of imatinib in combination requires special \nprecaution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data on the use of imatinib in pregnant women. There have been post-marketing \nreports of spontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies from women who have taken \nimatinib. Studies in animals have however shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the \npotential risk for the foetus is unknown. Imatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary. If it is used during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is limited information on imatinib distribution on human milk. Studies in two breast-feeding \nwomen revealed that both imatinib and its active metabolite can be distributed into human milk. The \nmilk plasma ratio studied in a single patient was determined to be 0.5 for imatinib and 0.9 for the \nmetabolite, suggesting greater distribution of the metabolite into the milk. Considering the combined \nconcentration of imatinib and the metabolite and the maximum daily milk intake by infants, the total \nexposure would be expected to be low (~10% of a therapeutic dose). However, since the effects of \nlow-dose exposure of the infant to imatinib are unknown, women taking imatinib should not \nbreast-feed. \n \nFertility \nIn non-clinical studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected (see section 5.3). Studies \non patients receiving imatinib and its effect on fertility and gametogenesis have not been performed. \nPatients concerned about their fertility on imatinib treatment should consult with their physician. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n10 \n\n\n\nPatients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness,blurred \nvision or somnolence during treatment with imatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended \nwhen driving a car or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nPatients with advanced stages of malignancies may have numerous confounding medical conditions \nthat make causality of adverse reactions difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to \nthe underlying disease, its progression, and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n \nIn clinical trials in CML, drug discontinuation for drug-related adverse reactions was observed in 2.4% \nof newly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in late chronic phase after failure of interferon therapy, \n4% of patients in accelerated phase after failure of interferon therapy and 5% of blast crisis patients \nafter failure of interferon therapy. In GIST the study drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse \nreactions in 4% of patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions were similar in all indications, with two exceptions. There was more \nmyelosuppression seen in CML patients than in GIST, which is probably due to the underlying \ndisease. In the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, 7 (5%) patients experienced \nCTC grade 3/4 GI bleeds (3 patients), intra-tumoural bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). GI tumour \nsites may have been the source of the GI bleeds (see section 4.4). GI and tumoural bleeding may be \nserious and sometimes fatal. The most commonly reported (\u2265 10%) drug-related adverse reactions in \nboth settings were mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, muscle cramps \nand rash. Superficial oedemas were a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as \nperiorbital or lower limb oedemas. However, these oedemas were rarely severe and may be managed \nwith diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of imatinib. \n \n\nWhen imatinib was combined with high dose chemotherapy in Ph+ ALL patients, transient liver \ntoxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinaemia were observed. Considering the \nlimited safety database, the adverse events thus far reported in children are consistent with the known \nsafety profile in adult patients with Ph+ ALL. The safety database for children with Ph+ALL is very \nlimited though no new safety concerns have been identified. \n \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and rapid weight \ngain with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as \u201cfluid retention\u201d. These \nreactions can usually be managed by withholding imatinib temporarily and with diuretics and other \nappropriate supportive care measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life-\nthreatening and several patients with blast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural \neffusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure. There were no special safety findings in paediatric \nclinical trials. \n \nAdverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported as more than an isolated case are listed below, by system organ class and \nby frequency. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nvery rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of frequency, the most \nfrequent

experience with \n\nimatinib. This includes spontaneous case reports as well as serious adverse events from ongoing \nstudies, the expanded access programmes, clinical pharmacology studies and exploratory \nstudies in unapproved indications. Because these reactions are reported from a population of \nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal \nrelationship to imatinib exposure. \n\n1 Pneumonia was reported most commonly in patients with transformed CML and in patients with \nGIST. \n\n2 Headache was the most common in GIST patients. \n3 On a patient-year basis, cardiac events including congestive heart failure were more commonly \n\nobserved in patients with transformed CML than in patients with chronic CML. \n4 Flushing was most common in GIST patients and bleeding (haematoma, haemorrhage) was \n\nmost common in patients with GIST and with transformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC). \n5 Pleural effusion was reported more commonly in patients with GIST and in patients with \n\ntransformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC) than in patients with chronic CML. \n6+7 Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were most commonly observed in GIST \n\npatients. \n8 Some fatal cases of hepatic failure and of hepatic necrosis have been reported. \n9 Musculoskeletal pain during treatment with imatinib or after discontinuation has been observed \n\nin post-marketing. \n10 Musculoskeletal pain and related events were more commonly observed in patients with CML \n\nthan in GIST patients. \n11 Fatal cases have been reported in patients with advanced disease, severe infections, severe \n\nneutropenia and other serious concomitant conditions. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nHaematology \nIn CML, cytopenias, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, have been a consistent finding in \nall studies, with the suggestion of a higher frequency at high doses \u2265 750 mg (phase I study). \nHowever, the occurrence of cytopenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the \nfrequency of grade 3 or 4 neutropenias (ANC < 1.0 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenias (platelet \ncount < 50 x 109/L) being between 4 and 6 times higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase (59\u201364% \nand 44\u201363% for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively) as compared to newly diagnosed \npatients in chronic phase CML (16.7% neutropenia and 8.9% thrombocytopenia). In newly diagnosed \nchronic phase CML grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count \n< 10 x 109/L) were observed in 3.6% and < 1% of patients, respectively. The median duration of the \nneutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes usually ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 3 to 4 weeks, \nrespectively. These events can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an \ninterruption of treatment with imatinib, but can in rare cases lead to permanent discontinuation of \ntreatment. In paediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed were grade 3 or \n4 cytopenias involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. These generally occur within the \nfirst several months of therapy. \n \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, grade 3 and 4 anaemia was reported \nin 5.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively, and may have been related to gastrointestinal or intra-\ntumoural bleeding in at least some of these patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 7.5% and \n2.7% of patients, respectively, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 0.7% of patients. No patient \ndeveloped grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts \noccurred mainly during the first six weeks of therapy, with values remaining relatively stable \nthereafter. \n \nBiochemistry \nSevere elevation of transaminases (<5%) or bilirubin (<1%) was seen in CML patients and was \nusually managed with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was \napproximately one week). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory \nabnormalities in less than 1% of CML patients. In GIST patients (study B2222), 6.8% of grade 3 or 4 \n\n14 \n\n\n\nALT (alanine aminotransferase) elevations and 4.8% of grade 3 or 4 AST (aspartate aminotransferase) \nelevations were observed. Bilirubin elevation was below 3%. \n \nThere have been cases of cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic failure; in some of them \noutcome was fatal, including one patient on high dose paracetamol. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHepatitis B reactivation \nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose is limited. Isolated cases of \nimatinib overdose have been reported spontaneously and in the literature. In the event of overdose the \npatient should be observed and appropriate symptomatic treatment given. Generally the reported \noutcome in these cases was \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d. Events that have been reported at different \ndose ranges are as follows: \n \nAdult population \n1200 to 1600 mg (duration varying between 1 to 10 days): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, \nerythema, oedema, swelling, fatigue, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, abdominal \npain, headache, decreased appetite. \n1800 to 3200 mg (as high as 3200 mg daily for 6 days): Weakness, myalgia, increased creatine \nphosphokinase, increased bilirubin, gastrointestinal pain. \n6400 mg (single dose): One case reported in the literature of one patient who experienced nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, pyrexia, facial swelling, decreased neutrophil count, increased \ntransaminases. \n8 to 10 g (single dose): Vomiting and gastrointestinal pain have been reported. \n \nPaediatric population \nOne 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 400 mg experienced vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia \nand another 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 980 mg experienced decreased white blood \ncell count and diarrhoea. \n \nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE01 \n \nMechanism of action \nImatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the \nBcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor TKs: Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor \n(SCF) coded for by the c-Kit proto-oncogene, the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), the \ncolony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and \n\n15 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nbeta (PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta). Imatinib can also inhibit cellular events mediated by activation \nof these receptor kinases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nImatinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at \nthe in vitro, cellular and in vivo levels. The compound selectively inhibits proliferation and induces \napoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukaemic cells from Philadelphia \nchromosome positive CML and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. \n \nIn vivo the compound shows anti-tumour activity as a single agent in animal models using Bcr-Abl \npositive tumour cells. \n \nImatinib is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \nPDGF-R, and inhibits PDGF-mediated cellular events. Constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor or \nthe Abl protein tyrosine kinases as a consequence of fusion to diverse partner proteins or constitutive \nproduction of PDGF have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPD, HES/CEL and DFSP. \nImatinib inhibits signalling and proliferation of cells driven by dysregulated PDGFR and Abl kinase \nactivity. \n \nClinical studies in chronic myeloid leukaemia \nThe effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and \nprogression-free survival. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as \nimprovement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival. \n \nA large, international, open-label, non-controlled phase II study was conducted in patients with \nPhiladelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML in the blast crisis phase of the disease. In addition, \nchildren and adolescents have been treated in two phase I studies (in patients with CML or Ph+ acute \nleukaemia) and one phase II study. \n \nIn the clinical study 38% of patients were \u2265 60 years of age and 12% of patients were \u2265 70 years of \nage. \n \nMyeloid blast crisis: 260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. 95 (37%) had received prior \nchemotherapy for treatment of either accelerated phase or blast crisis (\u201cpretreated patients\u201d) whereas \n165 (63%) had not (\u201cuntreated patients\u201d). The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg, the protocol \nwas subsequently amended to allow higher dosing and the remaining 223 patients were started at \n600 mg. \n \nThe primary efficacy variable was the rate of haematological response, reported as either complete \nhaematological response, no evidence of leukaemia (i.e. clearance of blasts from the marrow and the \nblood, but without a full peripheral blood recovery as for complete responses), or return to chronic \nphase CML. In this study, 31% of patients achieved a haematological response (36% in previously \nuntreated patients and 22% in previously treated patients) (Table 2). The rate of response was also \nhigher in the patients treated at 600 mg (33%) as compared to the patients treated at 400 mg (16%, \np=0.0220). The current estimate of the median survival of the previously untreated and treated patients \nwas 7.7 and 4.7 months, respectively. \n \nLymphoid blast crisis: a limited number of patients were enrolled in phase I studies (n=10). The rate of \nhaematological response was 70% with a duration of 2\u20133 months. \n \n\n16 \n\n\n\nTable 2 Response in adult CML study \n \n\n Study 0102 \n38-month data \n\nMyeloid blast crisis \n(n=260) \n\n % of patients (CI95%) \nHaematological response1 \n Complete haematological response (CHR) \n \n No evidence of leukaemia (NEL) \n \n Return to chronic phase (RTC) \n\n31% (25.2\u201336.8) \n8% \n\n \n5% \n\n \n18% \n\nMajor cytogenetic response2 \n Complete \n (Confirmed3) [95% CI] \n Partial \n\n15% (11.2\u201320.4) \n7% \n\n(2%) [0.6\u20134.4] \n8% \n\n1 Haematological response criteria (all responses to be confirmed after \u2265 4 weeks): \nCHR: In study 0102 [ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L, platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L, no blood blasts, BM blasts < 5% and \n\nno extramedullary disease] \nNEL Same criteria as for CHR but ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and platelets \u2265 20 x 109/L \nRTC < 15% blasts BM and PB, < 30% blasts+promyelocytes in BM and PB, < 20% basophils in PB, \n\nno extramedullary disease other than spleen and liver. \nBM = bone marrow, PB = peripheral blood \n2 Cytogenetic response criteria: \nA major response combines both complete and partial responses: complete (0% Ph+ metaphases), \npartial (1\u201335%) \n3 Complete cytogenetic response confirmed by a second bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation \nperformed at least one month after the initial bone marrow study. \n \nPaediatric patients: A total of 26 paediatric patients of age < 18 years with either chronic phase CML \n(n=11) or CML in blast crisis or Ph+ acute leukaemias (n=15) were enrolled in a dose-escalation phase \nI trial. This was a population of heavily pretreated patients, as 46% had received prior BMT and 73% a \nprior multi-agent chemotherapy. Patients were treated at doses of imatinib of 260 mg/m2/day (n=5), \n340 mg/m2/day (n=9), 440 mg/m2/day (n=7) and 570 mg/m2/day (n=5). Out of 9 patients with chronic \nphase CML and cytogenetic data available, 4 (44%) and 3 (33%) achieved a complete and partial \ncytogenetic response, respectively, for a rate of MCyR of 77%. \n \nA total of 51 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed and untreated CML in chronic phase have been \nenrolled in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. Patients were treated with imatinib \n340 mg/m2/day, with no interruptions in the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Imatinib treatment \ninduces a rapid response in newly diagnosed paediatric CML patients with a CHR of 78% after \n8 weeks of therapy. The high rate of CHR is accompanied by the development of a complete \ncytogenetic response (CCyR) of 65% which is comparable to the results observed in adults. \nAdditionally, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) was observed in 16% for a MCyR of 81%. The \nmajority of patients who achieved a CCyR developed the CCyR between months 3 and 10 with a \nmedian time to response based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5.6 months. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nimatinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation)-\npositive chronic myeloid leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical studies in Ph+ ALL \nNewly diagnosed Ph+ ALL: In a controlled study (ADE10) of imatinib versus chemotherapy induction \nin 55 newly diagnosed patients aged 55 years and over, imatinib used as single agent induced a \nsignificantly higher rate of complete haematological response than chemotherapy (96.3% vs. 50%; \n\n17 \n\n\n\np=0.0001). When salvage therapy with imatinib was administered in patients who did not respond or \nwho responded poorly to chemotherapy, it resulted in 9 patients (81.8%) out of 11 achieving a \ncomplete haematological response. This clinical effect was associated with a higher reduction in bcr- \nabl transcripts in the imatinib-treated patients than in the chemotherapy arm after 2 weeks of therapy \n(p=0.02). All patients received imatinib and consolidation chemotherapy (see Table 3) after induction \nand the levels of bcr-abl transcripts were identical in the two arms at 8 weeks. As expected on the \nbasis of the study design, no difference was observed in remission duration, disease-free survival or \noverall survival, although patients with complete molecular response and remaining in minimal \nresidual disease had a better outcome in terms of both remission duration (p=0.01) and disease-free \nsurvival (p=0.02). \n \nThe results observed in a population of 211 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients in four uncontrolled \nclinical studies (AAU02, ADE04, AJP01 and AUS01) are consistent with the results described above. \nImatinib in combination with chemotherapy induction (see Table 3) resulted in a complete \nhaematological response rate of 93% (147 out of 158 evaluable patients) and in a major cytogenetic \nresponse rate of 90% (19 out of 21 evaluable patients). The complete molecular response rate was \n48% (49 out of 102 evaluable patients). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) \nconstantly exceeded 1 year and were superior to historical control (DFS p<0.001; OS p<0.0001) in \ntwo studies (AJP01 and AUS01). \n \nTable 3 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib \n \nStudy ADE10 \n\nPrephase DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 1-5; CP 200 mg/m2 i.v., days 3, 4, 5; MTX \n12 mg intrathecal, day 1 \n\nRemission induction DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 6-7, 13-16; VCR 1 mg i.v., days 7, 14; IDA \n8 mg/m2 i.v.

Imatinib was administered intermittently in cohorts \n1-5, with increasing duration and earlier start of imatinib from cohort to cohort; cohort 1 receiving the \nlowest intensitiy and cohort 5 receiving the highest intensity of imatinib (longest duration in days with \ncontinuous daily imatinib dosing during the first chemotherapy treatment courses). Continuous daily \nexposure to imatinib early in the course of treatment in combination with chemotherapy in \ncohort 5-patients (n=50) improved the 4-year event-free survival (EFS) compared to historical controls \n(n=120), who received standard chemotherapy without imatinib (69.6% vs. 31.6%, respectively). The \nestimated 4-year OS in cohort 5-patients was 83.6% compared to 44.8% in the historical controls. 20 \nout of the 50 (40%) patients in cohort 5 received haematopoietic stem cell transplant. \n \nTable 4 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib in study I2301 \n \nConsolidation block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nIfosfamide (1.8 g/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nMESNA (360 mg/m2/dose q3h, x 8 doses/day, IV): days 1-5 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 6-15 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nIT Methotrexate (age-adjusted): day 1 ONLY \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 8, 15 \n\nConsolidation block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \nDays 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 1 \nARA-C (3 g/m2/dose q 12 h x 4, IV): days 2 and 3 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 4-13 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \n\n19 \n\n\n\nReinduction block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8, and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, IV): days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 1 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \nDays 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nReinduction block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8 and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, iv): Days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 2 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \ndays 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycles 1\u20134 \n\nMTX (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \ndays 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1, 29 \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 8-28 \nMethotrexate (20 mg/m2/week, PO): days 8, 15, 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nCPM (300 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nMESNA IV days 29-33 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 34-43 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycle 5 \n\nCranial irradiation (Block 5 only) \n12 Gy in 8 fractions for all patients that are CNS1 and CNS2 at diagnosis \n18 Gy in 10 fractions for patients that are CNS3 at diagnosis \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 11-56 (Withhold 6-MP during the \n6-10 days of cranial irradiation beginning on day 1 of Cycle 5.

Safety data from this study \nseem to be in line with the safety profile of imatinib in Ph+ ALL patients. \n \nRelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL: When imatinib was used as single agent in patients with \nrelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL, it resulted, in the 53 out of 411 patients evaluable for response, in a \nhaematological response rate of 30% (9% complete) and a major cytogenetic response rate of 23%. \n(Of note, out of the 411 patients, 353 were treated in an expanded access program without primary \nresponse data collected.) The median time to progression in the overall population of 411 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL ranged from 2.6 to 3.1 months, and median overall survival in the \n401 evaluable patients ranged from 4.9 to 9 months. The data was similar when re-analysed to include \nonly those patients age 55 or older. \n \nClinical studies in MDS/MPD \nExperience with imatinib in this indication is very limited and is based on haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased \nsurvival. One open label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing \nimatinib in diverse populations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with \nAbl, Kit or PDGFR protein tyrosine kinases. This study included 7 patients with MDS/MPD who were \ntreated with imatinib 400 mg daily. Three patients presented a complete haematological response \n(CHR) and one patient experienced a partial haematological response (PHR). At the time of the \noriginal analysis, three of the four patients with detected PDGFR gene rearrangements developed \nhaematological response (2 CHR and 1 PHR). The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 72 years.  \n \nAn observational registry (study L2401) was conducted to collect long-term safety and efficacy data in \npatients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms with PDGFR- \u03b2 rearrangement and who were \ntreated with imatinib. The 23 patients enrolled in this registry received imatinib at a median daily dose \nof 264 mg (range: 100 to 400 mg) for a median duration of 7.2 years (range 0.1 to 12.7 years). Due to \nthe observational nature of this registry, haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular assessment data \nwere available for 22, 9 and 17 of the 23 enrolled patients, respectively. When assuming \nconservatively that patients with missing data were non-responders, CHR was observed in 20/23 \n(87%) patients, CCyR in 9/23 (39.1%) patients, and MR in 11/23 (47.8%) patients, respectively. When \nthe response rate is calculated from patients with at least one valid assessment, the response rate for \nCHR, CCyR and MR was 20/22 (90.9%), 9/9 (100%) and 11/17 (64.7%), respectively. \n \nIn addition a further 24 patients with MDS/MPD were reported in 13 publications. 21 patients were \ntreated with imatinib 400 mg daily, while the other 3 patients received lower doses. In eleven patients \nPDGFR gene rearrangements was detected, 9 of them achieved a CHR and 1 PHR. The age of these \npatients ranged from 2 to 79 years. In a recent publication updated information from 6 of these \n11 patients revealed that all these patients remained in cytogenetic remission (range 32-38 months). \nThe same publication reported long term follow-up data from 12 MDS/MPD patients with PDGFR \ngene rearrangements (5 patients from study B2225). These patients received imatinib for a median of \n47 months (range 24 days \u2013 60 months). In 6 of these patients follow-up now exceeds 4 years. Eleven \npatients achieved rapid CHR; ten had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and a decrease \nor disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by RT-PCR. Haematological and cytogenetic \nresponses have been sustained for a median of 49 months (range 19-60) and 47 months (range 16-59), \n\n21 \n\n\n\nrespectively. The overall survival is 65 months since diagnosis (range 25-234). Imatinib administration \nto patients without the genetic translocation generally results in no improvement. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with MDS/MPD. Five (5) patients with MDS/MPD \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 4 publications. The age of these \npatients ranged from 3 months to 4 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging \nfrom 92.5 to 340 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, cytogenetic \nresponse and/or clinical response. \n \nClinical studies in HES/CEL \nOne open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in \ndiverse populations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or \nPDGFR protein tyrosine kinases. In this study, 14 patients with HES/CEL were treated with 100 mg to \n1,000 mg of imatinib daily. A further 162 patients with HES/CEL, reported in 35 published case \nreports and case series received imatinib at doses from 75 mg to 800 mg daily. Cytogenetic \nabnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the total population of 176 patients. In 61 of these 117 patients \nFIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 fusion kinase was identified. An additional four HES patients were found to be \nFIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1-positive in other 3 published reports. All 65 FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 fusion kinase \npositive patients achieved a CHR sustained for months (range from 1+ to 44+ months censored at the \ntime of the reporting). As reported in a recent publication 21 of these 65 patients also achieved \ncomplete molecular remission with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 13-67 months). The age \nof these patients ranged from 25 to 72 years. Additionally, improvements in symptomatology and \nother organ dysfunction abnormalities were reported by the investigators in the case reports. \nImprovements were reported in cardiac, nervous, skin/subcutaneous tissue, \nrespiratory/thoracic/mediastinal, musculoskeletal/connective tissue/vascular, and gastrointestinal \norgan systems. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with HES/CEL. Three (3) patients with HES and \nCEL associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these \npatients ranged from 2 to 16 years and imatinib was given at dose 300 mg/m2 daily or doses ranging \nfrom 200 to 400 mg daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, complete \ncytogenetic response and/or complete molecular response. \n \nClinical studies in DFSP \nOne phase II, open label, multicentre clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted including 12 patients \nwith DFSP treated with imatinib 800 mg daily. The age of the DFSP patients ranged from 23 to \n75 years; DFSP was metastatic, locally recurrent following initial resective surgery and not considered \namenable to further resective surgery at the time of study entry. The primary evidence of efficacy was \nbased on objective response rates. Out of the 12 patients enrolled, 9 responded, one completely and \n8 partially. Three of the partial responders were subsequently rendered disease free by surgery. The \nmedian duration of therapy in study B2225 was 6.2 months, with a maximum duration of 24.3 months. \nA further 6 DFSP patients treated with imatinib were reported in 5 published case reports, their ages \nranging from 18 months to 49 years. The adult patients reported in the published literature were \ntreated with either 400 mg (4 cases) or 800 mg (1 case) imatinib daily. 5 patients responded, \n3 completely and 2 partially. The median duration of therapy in the published literature ranged \nbetween 4 weeks and more than 20 months. The translocation t(17:22)[(q22:q13)], or its gene product, \nwas present in nearly all responders to imatinib treatment. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with DFSP. Five (5) patients with DFSP and \nPDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients ranged from \nnewborn to 14 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 400 to \n520 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved partial and/or complete response. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics of imatinib \n\n22 \n\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been evaluated over a dosage range of 25 to 1,000 mg. Plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles were analysed on day 1 and on either day 7 or day 28, by which time plasma \nconcentrations had reached steady state. \n \nAbsorption \nMean absolute bioavailability for imatinib is 98%. There was high between-patient variability in \nplasma imatinib AUC levels after an oral dose. When given with a high-fat meal, the rate of \nabsorption of imatinib was minimally reduced (11% decrease in Cmax and prolongation of tmax by \n1.5 h), with a small reduction in AUC (7.4%) compared to fasting conditions. The effect of prior \ngastrointestinal surgery on drug absorption has not been investigated. \n \nDistribution \nAt clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 95% \non the basis of in vitro experiments, mostly to albumin and alpha-acid-glycoprotein, with little binding \nto lipoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe main circulating metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, which shows \nsimilar in vitro potency to the parent. The plasma AUC for this metabolite was found to be only 16% \nof the AUC for imatinib. The plasma protein binding of the N-demethylated metabolite is similar to \nthat of the parent compound. \n \nImatinib and the N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 65% of the circulating \nradioactivity (AUC(0-48h)). The remaining circulating radioactivity consisted of a number of minor \nmetabolites. \n \nThe in vitro results showed that CYP3A4 was the major human P450 enzyme catalysing the \nbiotransformation of imatinib. Of a panel of potential comedications (acetaminophen, aciclovir, \nallopurinol, amphotericin, cytarabine, erythromycin, fluconazole, hydroxyurea, norfloxacin, \npenicillin V) only erythromycin (IC50 50 \u00b5M) and fluconazole (IC50 118 \u00b5M) showed inhibition of \nimatinib metabolism which could have clinical relevance. \n \nImatinib was shown in vitro to be a competitive inhibitor of marker substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2D6 \nand CYP3A4/5. Ki values in human liver microsomes were 27, 7.5 and 7.9 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. \nMaximal plasma concentrations of imatinib in patients are 2\u20134 \u03bcmol/L, consequently an inhibition of \nCYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism of co-administered drugs is possible. Imatinib did \nnot interfere with the biotransformation of 5-fluorouracil, but it inhibited paclitaxel metabolism as a \nresult of competitive inhibition of CYP2C8 (Ki - 34.7 \u00b5M). This Ki value is far higher than the \nexpected plasma levels of imatinib in patients, consequently no interaction is expected upon co-\nadministration of either 5-fluorouracil or paclitaxel and imatinib. \n \nElimination \nBased on the recovery of compound(s) after an oral 14C-labelled dose of imatinib, approximately 81% \nof the dose was recovered within 7 days in faeces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of dose). Unchanged \nimatinib accounted for 25% of the dose (5% urine, 20% faeces), the remainder being metabolites. \n \nPlasma pharmacokinetics \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the t\u00bd was approximately 18 h, suggesting that \nonce-daily dosing is appropriate. The increase in mean AUC with increasing dose was linear and dose \nproportional in the range of 25\u20131,000 mg imatinib after oral administration. There was no change in \nthe kinetics of imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation was 1.5\u20132.5-fold at steady state when \ndosed once daily. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis in CML patients, there was a small effect of age on the \nvolume of distribution (12% increase in patients > 65 years old). This change is not thought to be \nclinically significant. The effect of bodyweight on the clearance of imatinib is such that for a patient \n\n23 \n\n\n\nweighing 50 kg the mean clearance is expected to be 8.5 L/h, while for a patient weighing 100 kg the \nclearance will rise to 11.8 L/h. These changes are not considered sufficient to warrant dose adjustment \nbased on kg bodyweight. There is no effect of gender on the kinetics of imatinib. \n \nPharmacokinetics in paediatric population \nAs in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in paediatric patients in \nboth phase I and phase II studies. Dosing in children at 260 and 340 mg/m2/day achieved the same \nexposure, respectively, as doses of 400 mg and 600 mg in adult patients. The comparison of AUC(0-24) \non day 8 and day 1 at the 340 mg/m2/day dose level revealed a 1.7-fold drug accumulation after \nrepeated once-daily dosing. \n \nBased on pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis in paediatric patients with haematological \ndisorders (CML, Ph+ALL, or other haematological disorders treated with imatinib), clearance of \nimatinib increases with increasing body surface area (BSA). After correcting for the BSA effect, other \ndemographics such as age, body weight and body mass index did not have clinically significant effects \non the exposure of imatinib. The analysis confirmed that exposure of imatinib in paediatric patients \nreceiving 260 mg/m2 once daily (not exceeding 400 mg once daily) or 340 mg/m2 once daily (not \nexceeding 600 mg once daily) were similar to those in adult patients who received imatinib 400 mg or \n600 mg once daily. \n \nOrgan function impairment \nImatinib and its metabolites are not excreted via the kidney to a significant extent. Patients with mild \nand moderate impairment of renal function appear to have a higher plasma exposure than patients with \nnormal renal function. The increase is approximately 1.5- to 2-fold, corresponding to a 1.5-fold \nelevation of plasma AGP, to which imatinib binds strongly. The free drug clearance of imatinib is \nprobably similar between patients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function, since \nrenal excretion represents only a minor elimination pathway for imatinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nAlthough the results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is considerable inter-subject \nvariation, the mean exposure to imatinib did not increase in patients with varying degrees of liver \ndysfunction as compared to patients with normal liver function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of imatinib was assessed in rats, dogs, monkeys and rabbits. \n \nMultiple dose toxicity studies revealed mild to moderate haematological changes in rats, dogs and \nmonkeys, accompanied by bone marrow changes in rats and dogs. \n \nThe liver was a target organ in rats and dogs. Mild to moderate increases in transaminases and slight \ndecreases in cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein and albumin levels were observed in both species. \nNo histopathological changes were seen in rat liver. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated \nfor 2 weeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct \nhyperplasia. \n \nRenal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralisation and dilation of \nthe renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were \nobserved in several of these animals. In rats, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the renal \npapilla and in the urinary bladder was observed at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg in the 13-week study, without \nchanges in serum or urinary parameters. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed \nwith chronic imatinib treatment. \n \nIn a 39-week monkey study, no NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) was established at the \nlowest dose of 15 mg/kg, approximately one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg based on \nbody surface. Treatment resulted in worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these \nanimals. \n \n\n24 \n\n\n\nImatinib was not considered genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in \nvitro mammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus test. Positive \ngenotoxic effects were obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster \novary) for clastogenicity (chromosome aberration) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two \nintermediates of the manufacturing process, which are also present in the final product, are positive for \nmutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma \nassay. \n \nIn a study of fertility, in male rats dosed for 70 days prior to mating, testicular and epididymal weights \nand percent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately equal to the maximum clinical \ndose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. This was not seen at doses \u2264 20 mg/kg. A slight to \nmoderate reduction in spermatogenesis was also observed in the dog at oral doses \u2265 30 mg/kg. When \nfemale rats were dosed 14 days prior to mating and through to gestational day 6, there was no effect on \nmating or on number of pregnant females. At a dose of 60 mg/kg, female rats had significant post-\nimplantation foetal loss and a reduced number of live foetuses. This was not seen at doses \u2264 20 mg/kg. \n \nIn an oral pre- and postnatal development study in rats, red vaginal discharge was noted in the \n45 mg/kg/day group on either day 14 or day 15 of gestation. At the same dose, the number of stillborn \npups as well as those dying between postpartum days 0 and 4 was increased. In the F1 offspring, at the \nsame dose level, mean body weights were reduced from birth until terminal sacrifice and the number \nof litters achieving criterion for preputial separation was slightly decreased. F1 fertility was not \naffected, while an increased number of resorptions and a decreased number of viable foetuses was \nnoted at 45 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for both the maternal animals and the F1 \ngeneration was 15 mg/kg/day (one quarter of the maximum human dose of 800 mg). \n \nImatinib was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses \u2265 100 mg/kg, \napproximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. \nTeratogenic effects included exencephaly or encephalocele, absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal \nbones. These effects were not seen at doses \u2264 30 mg/kg. \n \nNo new target organs were identified in the rat juvenile development toxicology study (day 10 to 70 \npostpartum) with respect to the known target organs in adult rats. In the juvenile toxicology study, \neffects upon growth, delay in vaginal opening and preputial separation were observed at \napproximately 0.3 to 2 times the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of \n340 mg/m2. In addition, mortality was observed in juvenile animals (around weaning phase) at \napproximately 2 times the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of \n340 mg/m2. \n \nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study administration of imatinib at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day resulted \nin a statistically significant reduction in the longevity of males at 60 mg/kg/day and females at \n\u2265 30 mg/kg/day. Histopathological examination of decedents revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), \nchronic progressive nephropathy (females) and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death \nor reasons for sacrifice. Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys, urinary bladder, \nurethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands and non-\nglandular stomach. \n \nPapilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland were noted from 30 mg/kg/day onwards, \nrepresenting approximately 0.5 or 0.3 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day \nor 800 mg/day, respectively, and 0.4 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at \n340 mg/m2/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) was 15 mg/kg/day. The renal \nadenoma/carcinoma, the urinary bladder and urethra papilloma, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, \nthe parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and malignant medullary tumours of the adrenal glands \nand the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas were noted at 60 mg/kg/day, representing \napproximately 1.7 or 1 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, \nrespectively, and 1.2 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no \nobserved effect level (NOEL) was 30 mg/kg/day. \n \n\n25 \n\n\n\nThe mechanism and relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans are not yet \nclarified. \n \nNon-neoplastic lesions not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, \npancreas, endocrine organs and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and \ndilatation, leading to signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals. \n \nThe active substance imatinib demonstrates an environmental risk for sediment organisms. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nImatinib Actavis 100 mg film-coated tablets \nRound, 9.2 mm in diameter, biconvex dark yellow to brownish film-coated tablet, embossed with \ncompany logo on one side and \u201c36\u201d with score line on the other side. \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nImatinib Actavis 400 mg film-coated tablets \nOval-shape, 18.6x6.6 mm, biconvex dark yellow to brownish film-coated tablet, embossed with \ncompany logo on one side and \u201c37\u201d with score line on the other side. \nThe score line is not intended for breaking the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nImatinib Actavis is indicated for the treatment of \n- paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) \n\nchronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as \nthe first line of treatment. \n\n- paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or \nin accelerated phase or blast crisis. \n\n- adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. \n- adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. \n- adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. \n- adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with \n\nplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. \n- adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic \n\nleukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 rearrangement. \n \n\n29 \n\n\n\nThe effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. \n \nImatinib Actavis is indicated for \n- the treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and \n\nadult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. \n \nIn adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic \nresponse rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on \nobjective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experience \nwith imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very \nlimited (see section 5.1). There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased \nsurvival for these diseases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with \nhaematological malignancies and malignant sarcomas, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nPosology for CML in adult patients \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 600 mg/day for adult patients in blast crisis. Blast crisis is \ndefined as blasts \u2265 30% in blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than \nhepatosplenomegaly. \n \nTreatment duration: In clinical trials, treatment with imatinib was continued until disease progression. \nThe effect of stopping treatment after the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response has not \nbeen investigated. \n \nDose increases from 600 mg to a maximum of 800 mg (given as 400 mg twice daily) in patients with \nblast crisis may be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-\nleukaemia-related neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease \nprogression (at any time); failure to achieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least \n3 months of treatment; failure to achieve a cytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss \nof a previously achieved haematological and/or cytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored \nclosely following dose escalation given the potential for an increased incidence of adverse reactions at \nhigher dosages. \n \nPosology for CML in paediatric patients \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily \nis recommended for children with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML (not to exceed the \ntotal dose of 800 mg). Treatment can be given as a once daily dose or alternatively the daily dose may \nbe split into two administrations \u2013 one in the morning and one in the evening. The dose \nrecommendation is currently based on a small number of paediatric patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \nThere is no experience with the treatment of children below 2 years of age. \n \nDose increases from 340 mg/m2 daily to 570 mg/m2 daily (not to exceed the total dose of 800 mg) may \nbe considered in children in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction and severe non-leukaemia-\nrelated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the following circumstances: disease progression (at any \ntime); failure to achieve a satisfactory haematological response after at least 3 months of treatment; \nfailure to achieve a cytogenetic response after 12 months of treatment; or loss of a previously achieved \nhaematological and/or cytogenetic response. Patients should be monitored closely following dose \nescalation given the potential for an increased incidence of adverse reactions at higher dosages. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in adult patients \n\n30 \n\n\n\nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 600 mg/day for adult patients with Ph+ ALL. Haematological \nexperts in the management of this disease should supervise the therapy throughout all phases of care. \n \nTreatment schedule: On the basis of the existing data, imatinib has been shown to be effective and safe \nwhen administered at 600 mg/day in combination with chemotherapy in the induction phase, the \nconsolidation and maintenance phases of chemotherapy (see section 5.1) for adult patients with newly \ndiagnosed Ph+ ALL. The duration of imatinib therapy can vary with the treatment programme \nselected, but generally longer exposures to imatinib have yielded better results. \n \nFor adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL imatinib monotherapy at 600 mg/day is safe, \neffective and can be given until disease progression occurs. \n \nPosology for Ph+ ALL in paediatric patients \nDosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The dose of 340 mg/m2 daily \nis recommended for children with Ph+ ALL (not to exceed the total dose of 600 mg). \n \nPosology for MDS/MPD \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 400 mg/day for adult patients with MDS/MPD. \n \nTreatment duration: In the only clinical trial performed up to now, treatment with imatinib was \ncontinued until disease progression (see section 5.1). At the time of analysis, the treatment \nduration was a median of 47 months (24 days - 60 months). \n \nPosology for HES/CEL \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 100 mg/day for adult patients with HES/CEL. \n \nDose increase from 100 mg to 400 mg may be considered in the absence of adverse drug reactions \nif assessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy. \n \nTreatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit.  \n \nPosology for DFSP \nThe recommended dose of imatinib is 800 mg/day for adult patients with DFSP. \n \nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nNon-haematological adverse reactions \nIf a severe non-haematological adverse reaction develops with imatinib use, treatment must be \nwithheld until the event has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be resumed as appropriate depending \non the initial severity of the event. \n \nIf elevations in bilirubin > 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or in liver transaminases \n> 5 x IULN occur, imatinib should be withheld until bilirubin levels have returned to < 1.5 x IULN \nand transaminase levels to < 2.5 x IULN. Treatment with imatinib may then be continued at a reduced \ndaily dose. In adults the dose should be reduced from 400 to 300 mg or from 600 to 400 mg, or from \n800 mg to 600 mg, and in children from 340 to 260 mg/m2/day. \n \nHaematological adverse reactions \nDose reduction or treatment interruption for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are \nrecommended as indicated in the table below. \n \nDose adjustments for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: \n \nHES/CEL (starting dose \n100 mg) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction). \n\n31 \n\n\n\nMDS/MPD (starting dose \n400 mg) \nHES/CEL (at dose \n400 mg)  \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L.  \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction).  \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of 300 mg.  \n\nPaediatric chronic phase \nCML (at dose \n340 mg/m2) \n\nANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \nprevious dose (i.e. before severe \nadverse reaction). \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of \n260 mg/m2. \n\nCML in blast crisis and \nPh+ ALL (starting dose \n600 mg) \n\naANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/L \n\n1. Check whether cytopenia is related to \nleukaemia (marrow aspirate or \nbiopsy). \n\n2. If cytopenia is unrelated to leukaemia, \nreduce dose of imatinib to 400 mg. \n\n3. If cytopenia persists for 2 weeks, \nreduce further to 300 mg. \n\n4. If cytopenia persists for 4 weeks and \nis still unrelated to leukaemia, stop \nimatinib until ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and \nplatelets \u2265 20 x 109/L, then resume \ntreatment at 300 mg. \n\nPaediatric accelerated \nphase CML and blast \ncrisis (starting dose \n340 mg/m2) \n\naANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/L \n\n1. Check whether cytopenia is related to \nleukaemia (marrow aspirate or \nbiopsy). \n\n2. If cytopenia is unrelated to leukaemia, \nreduce dose of imatinib to 260 mg/m2. \n\n3. If cytopenia persists for 2 weeks, \nreduce further to 200 mg/m2. \n\n4. If cytopenia persists for 4 weeks and \nis still unrelated to leukaemia, stop \nimatinib until ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and \nplatelets \u2265 20 x 109/L, then resume \ntreatment at 200 mg/m2. \n\nDFSP (at dose 800 mg) ANC < 1.0 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1. Stop imatinib until ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \nand platelets \u2265 75 x 109/L. \n\n2. Resume treatment with imatinib at \n600 mg. \n\n3. In the event of recurrence of ANC \n< 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets \n< 50 x 109/L, repeat step 1 and resume \nimatinib at reduced dose of 400 mg.  \n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count \na occurring after at least 1 month of treatment \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n32 \n\n\n\nPaediatric use: There is no experience in children with CML below 2 years of age and with Ph+ALL \nbelow 1 year of age (see section 5.1). There is very limited experience in children with MDS/MPD, \nDFSP, and HES/CEL. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of imatinib in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL aged less than \n18 years of age have not been established in clinical trials. Currently available published data are \nsummarised in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nHepatic insufficiency: Imatinib is mainly metabolised through the liver. Patients with mild, moderate \nor severe liver dysfunction should be given the minimum recommended dose of 400 mg daily. The \ndose can be reduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nLiver dysfunction classification: \n \nLiver dysfunction Liver function tests \nMild Total bilirubin: = 1.5 ULN \n\nAST: >ULN (can be normal or <ULN if total bilirubin \nis >ULN) \n\nModerate Total bilirubin: >1.5-3.0 ULN \nAST: any \n\nSevere Total bilirubin: >3-10 ULN \nAST: any \n\nULN = upper limit of normal for the institution \nAST = aspartate aminotransferase \n \nRenal insufficiency: Patients with renal dysfunction or on dialysis should be given the minimum \nrecommended dose of 400 mg daily as starting dose. However, in these patients caution is \nrecommended. The dose can be reduced if not tolerated. If tolerated, the dose can be increased for lack \nof efficacy (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nElderly patients: Imatinib pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in older people. No \nsignificant age-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients in clinical \ntrials which included over 20% of patients age 65 and older. No specific dose recommendation is \nnecessary in older people. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor doses of 400 mg and above (see dosage recommendation above) a 400 mg tablet (not divisible) is \navailable. \nFor doses other than 400 mg and 800 mg (see dosage recommendation above) a 100 mg divisible \ntablet is available. \n \nThe prescribed dose should be administered orally with a meal and a large glass of water to minimise \nthe risk of gastrointestinal irritations. Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, \nwhereas a daily dose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day, in the morning and in \nthe evening.  \n \nFor patients unable to swallow the film-coated tablets, the tablets may be dispersed in a glass of still \nwater or apple juice. The required number of tablets should be placed in the appropriate volume of \nbeverage (approximately 50 ml for a 100 mg tablet, and 200 ml for a 400 mg tablet) and stirred with a \nspoon. The suspension should be administered immediately after complete disintegration of the \ntablet(s). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n33 \n\n\n\nHypersensitivity to soya or peanut. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen imatinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, there is a potential for drug \ninteractions. Caution should be used when taking imatinib with protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, \ncertain macrolides (see section 4.5), CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. \ncyclosporine, pimozide, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, \nterfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel, quinidine) or warfarin and other coumarin derivatives (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of imatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. \nJohn\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of \ntherapeutic failure. Therefore, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be \navoided (see section 4.5). \n \nHypothyroidism \nClinical cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing \nlevothyroxine replacement during treatment with imatinib (see section 4.5). Thyroid stimulating \nhormone (TSH) levels should be closely monitored in such patients. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nMetabolism of imatinib is mainly hepatic, and only 13% of excretion is through the kidneys. In \npatients with hepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate or severe), peripheral blood counts and liver \nenzymes should be carefully monitored (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). It should be noted that GIST \npatients may have hepatic metastases which could lead to hepatic impairment. \n \nCases of liver injury, including hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis, have been observed with imatinib. \nWhen imatinib is combined with high dose chemotherapy regimens, an increase in serious hepatic \nreactions has been detected. Hepatic function should be carefully monitored in circumstances where \nimatinib is combined with chemotherapy regimens also known to be associated with hepatic \ndysfunction (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nFluid retention \nOccurrences of severe fluid retention (pleural effusion, oedema, pulmonary oedema, ascites, \nsuperficial oedema) have been reported in approximately 2.5% of newly diagnosed CML patients \ntaking imatinib. Therefore, it is highly recommended that patients be weighed regularly. An \nunexpected rapid weight gain should be carefully investigated and if necessary appropriate supportive \ncare and therapeutic measures should be undertaken. In clinical trials, there was an increased incidence \nof these events in elderly patients and those with a prior history of cardiac disease. Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised in patients with cardiac dysfunction. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease \nPatients with cardiac disease, risk factors for cardiac failure or history of renal failure should be \nmonitored carefully, and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure \nshould be evaluated and treated. \n \nIn patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with occult infiltration of HES cells within the \nmyocardium, isolated cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated \nwith HES cell degranulation upon the initiation of imatinib therapy. The condition was reported to be \nreversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily \nwithholding imatinib. As cardiac adverse events have been reported uncommonly with imatinib, a \ncareful assessment of the benefit/risk of imatinib therapy should be considered in the HES/CEL \npopulation before treatment initiation. \n \n\n34 \n\n\n\nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases with PDGFR gene re-arrangements could be associated \nwith high eosinophil levels. Evaluation by a cardiology specialist, performance of an echocardiogram \nand determination of serum troponin should therefore be considered in patients with HES/CEL, and in \npatients with MDS/MPD associated with high eosinophil levels before imatinib is administered. If \neither is abnormal, follow-up with a cardiology specialist and the prophylactic use of systemic steroids \n(1-2 mg/kg) for one to two weeks concomitantly with imatinib should be considered at the initiation of \ntherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, both gastrointestinal and \nintra-tumoural haemorrhages were reported (see section 4.8). Based on the available data, no \npredisposing factors (e.g. tumour size, tumour location, coagulation disorders) have been identified \nthat place patients with GIST at a higher risk of either type of haemorrhage. Since increased \nvascularity and propensity for bleeding is a part of the nature and clinical course of GIST, standard \npractices and procedures for the monitoring and management of haemorrhage in all patients should be \napplied. \nIn addition, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, has \nbeen reported in post-marketing experience in patients with CML, ALL and other diseases (see \nsection 4.8). When needed, discontinuation of imatinib treatment may be considered. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nDue to the possible occurrence of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), correction of clinically significant \ndehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of imatinib (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome.  \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Imatinib Actavis. Experts \nin liver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in \npatients with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Imatinib \nActavis should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout \ntherapy and for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nPhototoxicity \nExposure to direct sunlight should be avoided or minimised due to the risk of phototoxicity associated \nwith imatinib treatment. Patients should be instructed to use measures such as protective clothing and \nsunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy \nBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy \n(TMA), including individual case reports for Imatinib Actavis (see section 4.8). If laboratory or \nclinical findings associated with TMA occur in a patient receiving Imatinib Actavis, treatment should \nbe discontinued and thorough evaluation for TMA, including ADAMTS13 activity and anti-\nADAMTS13-antibody determination, should be completed. If anti-ADAMTS13-antibody is elevated \nin conjunction with low ADAMTS13 activity, treatment with Imatinib Actavis should not be resumed. \n \nLaboratory tests \nComplete blood counts must be performed regularly during therapy with imatinib. Treatment of CML \npatients with imatinib has been associated with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. However, the \noccurrence of these cytopenias is likely to be related to the stage of the disease being treated and they \nwere more frequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis as compared to patients with \nchronic phase CML. Treatment with imatinib may be interrupted or the dose may be reduced, as \nrecommended in section 4.2. \n \n\n35 \n\n\n\nLiver function (transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored regularly in \npatients receiving imatinib. \n \nIn patients with impaired renal function, imatinib plasma exposure seems to be higher than that in \npatients with normal renal function, probably due to an elevated plasma level of alpha-acid \nglycoprotein (AGP), an imatinib-binding protein, in these patients. Patients with renal impairment \nshould be given the minimum starting dose. Patients with severe renal impairment should be treated \nwith caution. The dose can be reduced if not tolerated (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nLong-term treatment with imatinib may be associated with a clinically significant decline in renal \nfunction. Renal function should, therefore, be evaluated prior to the start of imatinib therapy and \nclosely monitored during therapy, with particular attention to those patients exhibiting risk factors for \nrenal dysfunction. If renal dysfunction is observed, appropriate management and treatment should be \nprescribed in accordance with standard treatment guidelines. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere have been case reports of growth retardation occurring in children and pre-adolescents receiving \nimatinib. In an observational study in the CML paediatric population, a statistically significant \ndecrease (but of uncertain clinical relevance) in median height standard deviation scores after 12 and \n24 months of treatment was reported in two small subsets irrespective of pubertal status or gender. \nClose monitoring of growth in children under imatinib treatment is recommended (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients \n \nLecithin (soya) \nThis medicinal product contains lecithin (soya). Patients, who are allergic to peanut or soya, may not \nuse this medicinal product. \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. protease inhibitors \nsuch as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, boceprevir; azole \nantifungals including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such \nas erythromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib \nconcentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of \nimatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a \nsingle dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering \nimatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. \n \nActive substances that may decrease imatinib plasma concentrations: \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or Hypericum perforatum, also known as \nSt. John\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of \ntherapeutic failure. Pretreatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single \n400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC(0-\u221e) by at least 54% and 74%, of the \nrespective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with \nmalignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal \nproducts (EIAEDs) such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for \nimatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or \nother strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. \n \nActive substances that may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib: \n\n36 \n\n\n\nImatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, \nrespectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended \nwhen administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. \ncyclosporine, pimozide, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, \nterfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel and quinidine). Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of \nother CYP3A4 metabolised drugs (e.g. triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel \nblockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, i.e. statins, etc.). \n \nBecause of known increased risks of bleeding in conjunction with the use of imatinib (e.g. \nhaemorrhage), patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight or standard \nheparin instead of coumarin derivatives such as warfarin. \n \nIn vitro imatinib inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at concentrations similar \nto those that affect CYP3A4 activity. Imatinib at 400 mg twice daily had an inhibitory effect on \nCYP2D6-mediated metoprolol metabolism, with metoprolol Cmax and AUC being increased by \napproximately 23% (90%CI [1.16-1.30]). Dose adjustments do not seem to be necessary when \nimatinib is co-administrated with CYP2D6 substrates, however caution is advised for CYP2D6 \nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic window such as metoprolol. In patients treated with metoprolol \nclinical monitoring should be considered. \n \nIn vitro, imatinib inhibits paracetamol O-glucuronidation with Ki value of 58.5 micromol/L. This \ninhibition has not been observed in vivo after the administration of imatinib 400 mg and \nparacetamol 1000 mg. Higher doses of imatinib and paracetamol have not been studied. \n \nCaution should therefore be exercised when using high doses of imatinib and paracetamol \nconcomitantly. \n \nIn thyroidectomy patients receiving levothyroxine, the plasma exposure to levothyroxine may be \ndecreased when imatinib is co-administered (see section 4.4). Caution is therefore recommended. \nHowever, the mechanism of the observed interaction is presently unknown. \n \nIn Ph+ ALL patients, there is clinical experience of co-administering imatinib with chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1), but drug-drug interactions between imatinib and chemotherapy regimens are not well \ncharacterised. Imatinib adverse events, i.e. hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression or others, may increase \nand it has been reported that concomitant use with L-asparaginase could be associated with increased \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.8). Therefore, the use of imatinib in combination requires special \nprecaution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data on the use of imatinib in pregnant women. There have been post-marketing \nreports of spontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies from women who have taken \nimatinib. Studies in animals have however shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) and the \npotential risk for the foetus is unknown. Imatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nnecessary. If it is used during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is limited information on imatinib distribution on human milk. Studies in two breast-feeding \nwomen revealed that both imatinib and its active metabolite can be distributed into human milk. The \nmilk plasma ratio studied in a single patient was determined to be 0.5 for imatinib and 0.9 for the \nmetabolite, suggesting greater distribution of the metabolite into the milk. Considering the combined \nconcentration of imatinib and the metabolite and the maximum daily milk intake by infants, the total \n\n37 \n\n\n\nexposure would be expected to be low (~10% of a therapeutic dose). However, since the effects of \nlow-dose exposure of the infant to imatinib are unknown, women taking imatinib should not \nbreast-feed. \n \nFertility \nIn non-clinical studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected (see section 5.3). Studies \non patients receiving imatinib and its effect on fertility and gametogenesis have not been performed. \nPatients concerned about their fertility on imatinib treatment should consult with their physician. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness,blurred \nvision or somnolence during treatment with imatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended \nwhen driving a car or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nPatients with advanced stages of malignancies may have numerous confounding medical conditions \nthat make causality of adverse reactions difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to \nthe underlying disease, its progression, and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n \nIn clinical trials in CML, drug discontinuation for drug-related adverse reactions was observed in 2.4% \nof newly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in late chronic phase after failure of interferon therapy, \n4% of patients in accelerated phase after failure of interferon therapy and 5% of blast crisis patients \nafter failure of interferon therapy. In GIST the study drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse \nreactions in 4% of patients. \n \nThe adverse reactions were similar in all indications, with two exceptions. There was more \nmyelosuppression seen in CML patients than in GIST, which is probably due to the underlying \ndisease. In the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, 7 (5%) patients experienced \nCTC grade 3/4 GI bleeds (3 patients), intra-tumoural bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). GI tumour \nsites may have been the source of the GI bleeds (see section 4.4). GI and tumoural bleeding may be \nserious and sometimes fatal. The most commonly reported (\u2265 10%) drug-related adverse reactions in \nboth settings were mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, muscle cramps \nand rash. Superficial oedemas were a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as \nperiorbital or lower limb oedemas. However, these oedemas were rarely severe and may be managed \nwith diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of imatinib. \n \n\nWhen imatinib was combined with high dose chemotherapy in Ph+ ALL patients, transient liver \ntoxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinaemia were observed. Considering the \nlimited safety database, the adverse events thus far reported in children are consistent with the known \nsafety profile in adult patients with Ph+ ALL. The safety database for children with Ph+ALL is very \nlimited though no new safety concerns have been identified. \n \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and rapid weight \ngain with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as \u201cfluid retention\u201d. These \nreactions can usually be managed by withholding imatinib temporarily and with diuretics and other \nappropriate supportive care measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life-\nthreatening and several patients with blast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural \neffusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure. There were no special safety findings in paediatric \nclinical trials. \n \nAdverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported as more than an isolated case are listed below, by system organ class and \nby frequency. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common \n\n38 \n\n\n\n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nvery rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of frequency, the most

\n\nimatinib. This includes spontaneous case reports as well as serious adverse events from ongoing \nstudies, the expanded access programmes, clinical pharmacology studies and exploratory \nstudies in unapproved indications. Because these reactions are reported from a population of \nuncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal \nrelationship to imatinib exposure. \n\n1 Pneumonia was reported most commonly in patients with transformed CML and in patients with \nGIST. \n\n2 Headache was the most common in GIST patients. \n3 On a patient-year basis, cardiac events including congestive heart failure were more commonly \n\nobserved in patients with transformed CML than in patients with chronic CML. \n4 Flushing was most common in GIST patients and bleeding (haematoma, haemorrhage) was \n\nmost common in patients with GIST and with transformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC). \n5 Pleural effusion was reported more commonly in patients with GIST and in patients with \n\ntransformed CML (CML-AP and CML-BC) than in patients with chronic CML. \n6+7 Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were most commonly observed in GIST \n\npatients. \n8 Some fatal cases of hepatic failure and of hepatic necrosis have been reported. \n9 Musculoskeletal pain during treatment with imatinib or after discontinuation has been observed \n\nin post-marketing. \n10 Musculoskeletal pain and related events were more commonly observed in patients with CML \n\nthan in GIST patients. \n11 Fatal cases have been reported in patients with advanced disease, severe infections, severe \n\nneutropenia and other serious concomitant conditions. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nHaematology \nIn CML, cytopenias, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, have been a consistent finding in \nall studies, with the suggestion of a higher frequency at high doses \u2265 750 mg (phase I study). \nHowever, the occurrence of cytopenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the \nfrequency of grade 3 or 4 neutropenias (ANC < 1.0 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenias (platelet \ncount < 50 x 109/L) being between 4 and 6 times higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase (59\u201364% \nand 44\u201363% for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively) as compared to newly diagnosed \npatients in chronic phase CML (16.7% neutropenia and 8.9% thrombocytopenia). In newly diagnosed \nchronic phase CML grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count \n< 10 x 109/L) were observed in 3.6% and < 1% of patients, respectively. The median duration of the \nneutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes usually ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 3 to 4 weeks, \nrespectively. These events can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an \ninterruption of treatment with imatinib, but can in rare cases lead to permanent discontinuation of \ntreatment. In paediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed were grade 3 or \n4 cytopenias involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. These generally occur within the \nfirst several months of therapy. \n \nIn the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, grade 3 and 4 anaemia was reported \nin 5.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively, and may have been related to gastrointestinal or intra-\ntumoural bleeding in at least some of these patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 7.5% and \n\n41 \n\n\n\n2.7% of patients, respectively, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 0.7% of patients. No patient \ndeveloped grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts \noccurred mainly during the first six weeks of therapy, with values remaining relatively stable \nthereafter. \n \nBiochemistry \nSevere elevation of transaminases (<5%) or bilirubin (<1%) was seen in CML patients and was \nusually managed with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was \napproximately one week). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory \nabnormalities in less than 1% of CML patients. In GIST patients (study B2222), 6.8% of grade 3 or 4 \nALT (alanine aminotransferase) elevations and 4.8% of grade 3 or 4 AST (aspartate aminotransferase) \nelevations were observed. Bilirubin elevation was below 3%. \n \nThere have been cases of cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic failure; in some of them \noutcome was fatal, including one patient on high dose paracetamol. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHepatitis B reactivation \nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose is limited. Isolated cases of \nimatinib overdose have been reported spontaneously and in the literature. In the event of overdose the \npatient should be observed and appropriate symptomatic treatment given. Generally the reported \noutcome in these cases was \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d. Events that have been reported at different \ndose ranges are as follows: \n \nAdult population \n1200 to 1600 mg (duration varying between 1 to 10 days): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, \nerythema, oedema, swelling, fatigue, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, abdominal \npain, headache, decreased appetite. \n1800 to 3200 mg (as high as 3200 mg daily for 6 days): Weakness, myalgia, increased creatine \nphosphokinase, increased bilirubin, gastrointestinal pain. \n6400 mg (single dose): One case reported in the literature of one patient who experienced nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, pyrexia, facial swelling, decreased neutrophil count, increased \ntransaminases. \n8 to 10 g (single dose): Vomiting and gastrointestinal pain have been reported. \n \nPaediatric population \nOne 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 400 mg experienced vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia \nand another 3-year-old male exposed to a single dose of 980 mg experienced decreased white blood \ncell count and diarrhoea. \n \nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n42 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE01 \n \nMechanism of action \nImatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of the \nBcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), as well as several receptor TKs: Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor \n(SCF) coded for by the c-Kit proto-oncogene, the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), the \ncolony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and \nbeta (PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta). Imatinib can also inhibit cellular events mediated by activation \nof these receptor kinases. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nImatinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at \nthe in vitro, cellular and in vivo levels. The compound selectively inhibits proliferation and induces \napoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukaemic cells from Philadelphia \nchromosome positive CML and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. \n \nIn vivo the compound shows anti-tumour activity as a single agent in animal models using Bcr-Abl \npositive tumour cells. \n \nImatinib is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \nPDGF-R, and inhibits PDGF-mediated cellular events. Constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor or \nthe Abl protein tyrosine kinases as a consequence of fusion to diverse partner proteins or constitutive \nproduction of PDGF have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/MPD, HES/CEL and DFSP. \nImatinib inhibits signalling and proliferation of cells driven by dysregulated PDGFR and Abl kinase \nactivity. \n \nClinical studies in chronic myeloid leukaemia \nThe effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and \nprogression-free survival. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit, such as \nimprovement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival. \n \nA large, international, open-label, non-controlled phase II study was conducted in patients with \nPhiladelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML -in the blast crisis phase of the disease. In addition, \nchildren and adolescents have been treated in two phase I studies (in patients with CML or Ph+ acute \nleukaemia) and one phase II study. \n \nIn the clinical study 38% of patients were \u2265 60 years of age and 12% of patients were \u2265 70 years of \nage. \n \nMyeloid blast crisis: 260 patients with myeloid blast crisis were enrolled. 95 (37%) had received prior \nchemotherapy for treatment of either accelerated phase or blast crisis (\u201cpretreated patients\u201d) whereas \n165 (63%) had not (\u201cuntreated patients\u201d). The first 37 patients were started at 400 mg, the protocol \nwas subsequently amended to allow higher dosing and the remaining 223 patients were started at \n600 mg. \n \nThe primary efficacy variable was the rate of haematological response, reported as either complete \nhaematological response, no evidence of leukaemia (i.e. clearance of blasts from the marrow and the \nblood, but without a full peripheral blood recovery as for complete responses), or return to chronic \nphase CML. In this study, 31% of patients achieved a haematological response (36% in previously \nuntreated patients and 22% in previously treated patients) (Table 2). The rate of response was also \nhigher in the patients treated at 600 mg (33%) as compared to the patients treated at 400 mg (16%, \np=0.0220). The current estimate of the median survival of the previously untreated and treated patients \nwas 7.7 and 4.7 months, respectively. \n \n\n43 \n\n\n\nLymphoid blast crisis: a limited number of patients were enrolled in phase I studies (n=10). The rate of \nhaematological response was 70% with a duration of 2\u20133 months. \n \nTable 2 Response in adult CML study \n \n\n Study 0102 \n38-month data \nMyeloid blast \n\ncrisis \n(n=260) \n\n % of patients (CI95%) \nHaematological response1 \n Complete haematological response (CHR) \n \n No evidence of leukaemia (NEL) \n \n Return to chronic phase (RTC) \n\n31% (25.2\u201336.8) \n8% \n\n \n5% \n\n \n18% \n\nMajor cytogenetic response2 \n Complete \n (Confirmed3) [95% CI] \n Partial \n\n15% (11.2\u201320.4) \n7% \n\n(2%) [0.6\u20134.4] \n8% \n\n1 Haematological response criteria (all responses to be confirmed after \u2265 4 weeks): \nCHR: In study 0102 [ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/L, platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L, no blood blasts, BM blasts < 5% and \n\nno extramedullary disease] \nNEL Same criteria as for CHR but ANC \u2265 1 x 109/L and platelets \u2265 20 x 109/L \nRTC < 15% blasts BM and PB, < 30% blasts+promyelocytes in BM and PB, < 20% basophils in PB, \n\nno extramedullary disease other than spleen and liver. \nBM = bone marrow, PB = peripheral blood \n2 Cytogenetic response criteria: \nA major response combines both complete and partial responses: complete (0% Ph+ metaphases), \npartial (1\u201335%) \n3 Complete cytogenetic response confirmed by a second bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation \nperformed at least one month after the initial bone marrow study. \n \nPaediatric patients: A total of 26 paediatric patients of age < 18 years with either chronic phase CML \n(n=11) or CML in blast crisis or Ph+ acute leukaemias (n=15) were enrolled in a dose-escalation phase \nI trial. This was a population of heavily pretreated patients, as 46% had received prior BMT and 73% a \nprior multi-agent chemotherapy. Patients were treated at doses of imatinib of 260 mg/m2/day (n=5), \n340 mg/m2/day (n=9), 440 mg/m2/day (n=7) and 570 mg/m2/day (n=5). Out of 9 patients with chronic \nphase CML and cytogenetic data available, 4 (44%) and 3 (33%) achieved a complete and partial \ncytogenetic response, respectively, for a rate of MCyR of 77%. \n \nA total of 51 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed and untreated CML in chronic phase have been \nenrolled in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. Patients were treated with imatinib \n340 mg/m2/day, with no interruptions in the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Imatinib treatment \ninduces a rapid response in newly diagnosed paediatric CML patients with a CHR of 78% after \n8 weeks of therapy. The high rate of CHR is accompanied by the development of a complete \ncytogenetic response (CCyR) of 65% which is comparable to the results observed in adults. \nAdditionally, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) was observed in 16% for a MCyR of 81%. The \nmajority of patients who achieved a CCyR developed the CCyR between months 3 and 10 with a \nmedian time to response based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5.6 months. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nimatinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation)-\npositive chronic myeloid leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical studies in Ph+ ALL \n\n44 \n\n\n\nNewly diagnosed Ph+ ALL: In a controlled study (ADE10) of imatinib versus chemotherapy induction \nin 55 newly diagnosed patients aged 55 years and over, imatinib used as single agent induced a \nsignificantly higher rate of complete haematological response than chemotherapy (96.3% vs. 50%; \np=0.0001). When salvage therapy with imatinib was administered in patients who did not respond or \nwho responded poorly to chemotherapy, it resulted in 9 patients (81.8%) out of 11 achieving a \ncomplete haematological response. This clinical effect was associated with a higher reduction in bcr- \nabl transcripts in the imatinib-treated patients than in the chemotherapy arm after 2 weeks of therapy \n(p=0.02). All patients received imatinib and consolidation chemotherapy (see Table 3) after induction \nand the levels of bcr-abl transcripts were identical in the two arms at 8 weeks. As expected on the \nbasis of the study design, no difference was observed in remission duration, disease-free survival or \noverall survival, although patients with complete molecular response and remaining in minimal \nresidual disease had a better outcome in terms of both remission duration (p=0.01) and disease-free \nsurvival (p=0.02). \n \nThe results observed in a population of 211 newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients in four uncontrolled \nclinical studies (AAU02, ADE04, AJP01 and AUS01) are consistent with the results described above. \nImatinib in combination with chemotherapy induction (see Table 3) resulted in a complete \nhaematological response rate of 93% (147 out of 158 evaluable patients) and in a major cytogenetic \nresponse rate of 90% (19 out of 21 evaluable patients). The complete molecular response rate was \n48% (49 out of 102 evaluable patients). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) \nconstantly exceeded 1 year and were superior to historical control (DFS p<0.001; OS p<0.0001) in \ntwo studies (AJP01 and AUS01). \n \nTable 3 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib \n \nStudy ADE10 \n\nPrephase DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 1-5; CP 200 mg/m2 i.v., days 3, 4, 5; MTX \n12 mg intrathecal, day 1 \n\nRemission induction DEX 10 mg/m2 oral, days 6-7, 13-16; VCR 1 mg i.v., days 7, 14; IDA \n8 mg/m2 i.v.

Imatinib was administered intermittently in cohorts \n1-5, with increasing duration and earlier start of imatinib from cohort to cohort; cohort 1 receiving the \nlowest intensitiy and cohort 5 receiving the highest intensity of imatinib (longest duration in days with \ncontinuous daily imatinib dosing during the first chemotherapy treatment courses). Continuous daily \nexposure to imatinib early in the course of treatment in combination with chemotherapy in \ncohort 5-patients (n=50) improved the 4-year event-free survival (EFS) compared to historical controls \n(n=120), who received standard chemotherapy without imatinib (69.6% vs. 31.6%, respectively). The \nestimated 4-year OS in cohort 5-patients was 83.6% compared to 44.8% in the historical controls. 20 \nout of the 50 (40%) patients in cohort 5 received haematopoietic stem cell transplant. \n \nTable 4 Chemotherapy regimen used in combination with imatinib in study I2301 \n \nConsolidation block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nIfosfamide (1.8 g/m2/day, IV): days 1-5 \nMESNA (360 mg/m2/dose q3h, x 8 doses/day, IV): days 1-5 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 6-15 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nIT Methotrexate (age-adjusted): day 1 ONLY \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 8, 15 \n\nConsolidation block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \nDays 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): day 1 \nARA-C (3 g/m2/dose q 12 h x 4, IV): days 2 and 3 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 4-13 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \n\n46 \n\n\n\nReinduction block 1 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8, and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, IV): days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 1 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \nDays 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nReinduction block 2 \n(3 weeks) \n\nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 8 and 15 \nDAUN (45 mg/m2/day bolus, IV): days 1 and 2 \nCPM (250 mg/m2/dose q12h x 4 doses, iv): Days 3 and 4 \nPEG-ASP (2500 IUnits/m2, IM): day 4 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 5-14 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 15 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-7 and 15-21 \n\nIntensification block 2 \n(9 weeks) \n\nMethotrexate (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): days 1 and 15 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \ndays 2, 3, 16, and 17 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1 and 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nCPM (300 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nMESNA (150 mg/m2/day, IV): days 22-26 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 27-36 or until ANC > 1500 post nadir \nARA-C (3 g/m2, q12h, IV): days 43, 44 \nL-ASP (6000 IUnits/m2, IM): day 44 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycles 1\u20134 \n\nMTX (5 g/m2 over 24 hours, IV): day 1 \nLeucovorin (75 mg/m2 at hour 36, IV; 15 mg/m2 IV or PO q6h x 6 doses)iii: \ndays 2 and 3 \nTriple IT therapy (age-adjusted): days 1, 29 \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 8-28 \nMethotrexate (20 mg/m2/week, PO): days 8, 15, 22 \nVP-16 (100 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nCPM (300 mg/m2, IV): days 29-33 \nMESNA IV days 29-33 \nG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg, SC): days 34-43 \n\nMaintenance \n(8-week cycles) \nCycle 5 \n\nCranial irradiation (Block 5 only) \n12 Gy in 8 fractions for all patients that are CNS1 and CNS2 at diagnosis \n18 Gy in 10 fractions for patients that are CNS3 at diagnosis \nVCR (1.5 mg/m2/day, IV): days 1, 29 \nDEX (6 mg/m2/day, PO): days 1-5; 29-33 \n6-MP (75 mg/m2/day, PO): days 11-56 (Withhold 6-MP during the \n6-10 days of cranial irradiation beginning on day 1 of Cycle 5.

Safety data from this study \nseem to be in line with the safety profile of imatinib in Ph+ ALL patients. \n \nRelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL: When imatinib was used as single agent in patients with \nrelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL, it resulted, in the 53 out of 411 patients evaluable for response, in a \nhaematological response rate of 30% (9% complete) and a major cytogenetic response rate of 23%. \n(Of note, out of the 411 patients, 353 were treated in an expanded access program without primary \nresponse data collected.) The median time to progression in the overall population of 411 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL ranged from 2.6 to 3.1 months, and median overall survival in the \n401 evaluable patients ranged from 4.9 to 9 months. The data was similar when re-analysed to include \nonly those patients age 55 or older. \n \nClinical studies in MDS/MPD \nExperience with imatinib in this indication is very limited and is based on haematological and \ncytogenetic response rates. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased \nsurvival. One open label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing \nimatinib in diverse populations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with \nAbl, Kit or PDGFR protein tyrosine kinases. This study included 7 patients with MDS/MPD who were \ntreated with imatinib 400 mg daily. Three patients presented a complete haematological response \n(CHR) and one patient experienced a partial haematological response (PHR). At the time of the \noriginal analysis, three of the four patients with detected PDGFR gene rearrangements developed \nhaematological response (2 CHR and 1 PHR). The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 72 years.  \n \nAn observational registry (study L2401) was conducted to collect long-term safety and efficacy data in \npatients suffering from myeloproliferative neoplasms with PDGFR- \u03b2 rearrangement and who were \ntreated with imatinib. The 23 patients enrolled in this registry received imatinib at a median daily dose \nof 264 mg (range: 100 to 400 mg) for a median duration of 7.2 years (range 0.1 to 12.7 years). Due to \nthe observational nature of this registry, haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular assessment data \nwere available for 22, 9 and 17 of the 23 enrolled patients, respectively. When assuming \nconservatively that patients with missing data were non-responders, CHR was observed in 20/23 \n(87%) patients, CCyR in 9/23 (39.1%) patients, and MR in 11/23 (47.8%) patients, respectively. When \nthe response rate is calculated from patients with at least one valid assessment, the response rate for \nCHR, CCyR and MR was 20/22 (90.9%), 9/9 (100%) and 11/17 (64.7%), respectively. \n \nIn addition a further 24 patients with MDS/MPD were reported in 13 publications. 21 patients were \ntreated with imatinib 400 mg daily, while the other 3 patients received lower doses. In eleven patients \nPDGFR gene rearrangements was detected, 9 of them achieved a CHR and 1 PHR. The age of these \npatients ranged from 2 to 79 years. In a recent publication updated information from 6 of these \n11 patients revealed that all these patients remained in cytogenetic remission (range 32-38 months). \nThe same publication reported long term follow-up data from 12 MDS/MPD patients with PDGFR \ngene rearrangements (5 patients from study B2225). These patients received imatinib for a median of \n47 months (range 24 days \u2013 60 months). In 6 of these patients follow-up now exceeds 4 years. Eleven \npatients achieved rapid CHR; ten had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and a decrease \nor disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by RT-PCR. Haematological and cytogenetic \nresponses have been sustained for a median of 49 months (range 19-60) and 47 months (range 16-59), \n\n48 \n\n\n\nrespectively. The overall survival is 65 months since diagnosis (range 25-234). Imatinib administration \nto patients without the genetic translocation generally results in no improvement. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with MDS/MPD. Five (5) patients with MDS/MPD \nassociated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 4 publications. The age of these \npatients ranged from 3 months to 4 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging \nfrom 92.5 to 340 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, cytogenetic \nresponse and/or clinical response. \n \nClinical studies in HES/CEL \nOne open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted testing imatinib in \ndiverse populations of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases associated with Abl, Kit or \nPDGFR protein tyrosine kinases. In this study, 14 patients with HES/CEL were treated with 100 mg to \n1,000 mg of imatinib daily. A further 162 patients with HES/CEL, reported in 35 published case \nreports and case series received imatinib at doses from 75 mg to 800 mg daily. Cytogenetic \nabnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the total population of 176 patients. In 61 of these 117 patients \nFIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 fusion kinase was identified. An additional four HES patients were found to be \nFIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1-positive in other 3 published reports. All 65 FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 fusion kinase \npositive patients achieved a CHR sustained for months (range from 1+ to 44+ months censored at the \ntime of the reporting). As reported in a recent publication 21 of these 65 patients also achieved \ncomplete molecular remission with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 13-67 months). The age \nof these patients ranged from 25 to 72 years. Additionally, improvements in symptomatology and \nother organ dysfunction abnormalities were reported by the investigators in the case reports. \nImprovements were reported in cardiac, nervous, skin/subcutaneous tissue, \nrespiratory/thoracic/mediastinal, musculoskeletal/connective tissue/vascular, and gastrointestinal \norgan systems. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with HES/CEL. Three (3) patients with HES and \nCEL associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these \npatients ranged from 2 to 16 years and imatinib was given at dose 300 mg/m2 daily or doses ranging \nfrom 200 to 400 mg daily. All patients achieved complete haematological response, complete \ncytogenetic response and/or complete molecular response. \n \nClinical studies in DFSP \nOne phase II, open label, multicentre clinical trial (study B2225) was conducted including 12 patients \nwith DFSP treated with imatinib 800 mg daily. The age of the DFSP patients ranged from 23 to \n75 years; DFSP was metastatic, locally recurrent following initial resective surgery and not considered \namenable to further resective surgery at the time of study entry. The primary evidence of efficacy was \nbased on objective response rates. Out of the 12 patients enrolled, 9 responded, one completely and \n8 partially. Three of the partial responders were subsequently rendered disease free by surgery. The \nmedian duration of therapy in study B2225 was 6.2 months, with a maximum duration of 24.3 months. \nA further 6 DFSP patients treated with imatinib were reported in 5 published case reports, their ages \nranging from 18 months to 49 years. The adult patients reported in the published literature were \ntreated with either 400 mg (4 cases) or 800 mg (1 case) imatinib daily. 5 patients responded, \n3 completely and 2 partially. The median duration of therapy in the published literature ranged \nbetween 4 weeks and more than 20 months. The translocation t(17:22)[(q22:q13)], or its gene product, \nwas present in nearly all responders to imatinib treatment. \n \nThere are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with DFSP. Five (5) patients with DFSP and \nPDGFR gene re-arrangements were reported in 3 publications. The age of these patients ranged from \nnewborn to 14 years and imatinib was given at dose 50 mg daily or doses ranging from 400 to \n520 mg/m2 daily. All patients achieved partial and/or complete response. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics of imatinib \n\n49 \n\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been evaluated over a dosage range of 25 to 1,000 mg. Plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles were analysed on day 1 and on either day 7 or day 28, by which time plasma \nconcentrations had reached steady state. \n \nAbsorption \nMean absolute bioavailability for imatinib is 98%. There was high between-patient variability in \nplasma imatinib AUC levels after an oral dose. When given with a high-fat meal, the rate of \nabsorption of imatinib was minimally reduced (11% decrease in Cmax and prolongation of tmax by \n1.5 h), with a small reduction in AUC (7.4%) compared to fasting conditions. The effect of prior \ngastrointestinal surgery on drug absorption has not been investigated. \n \nDistribution \nAt clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 95% \non the basis of in vitro experiments, mostly to albumin and alpha-acid-glycoprotein, with little binding \nto lipoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe main circulating metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative, which shows \nsimilar in vitro potency to the parent. The plasma AUC for this metabolite was found to be only 16% \nof the AUC for imatinib. The plasma protein binding of the N-demethylated metabolite is similar to \nthat of the parent compound. \n \nImatinib and the N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 65% of the circulating \nradioactivity (AUC(0-48h)). The remaining circulating radioactivity consisted of a number of minor \nmetabolites. \n \nThe in vitro results showed that CYP3A4 was the major human P450 enzyme catalysing the \nbiotransformation of imatinib. Of a panel of potential comedications (acetaminophen, aciclovir, \nallopurinol, amphotericin, cytarabine, erythromycin, fluconazole, hydroxyurea, norfloxacin, \npenicillin V) only erythromycin (IC50 50 \u00b5M) and fluconazole (IC50 118 \u00b5M) showed inhibition of \nimatinib metabolism which could have clinical relevance. \n \nImatinib was shown in vitro to be a competitive inhibitor of marker substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2D6 \nand CYP3A4/5. Ki values in human liver microsomes were 27, 7.5 and 7.9 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. \nMaximal plasma concentrations of imatinib in patients are 2\u20134 \u03bcmol/L, consequently an inhibition of \nCYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4/5-mediated metabolism of co-administered drugs is possible. Imatinib did \nnot interfere with the biotransformation of 5-fluorouracil, but it inhibited paclitaxel metabolism as a \nresult of competitive inhibition of CYP2C8 (Ki - 34.7 \u00b5M). This Ki value is far higher than the \nexpected plasma levels of imatinib in patients, consequently no interaction is expected upon co-\nadministration of either 5-fluorouracil or paclitaxel and imatinib. \n \nElimination \nBased on the recovery of compound(s) after an oral 14C-labelled dose of imatinib, approximately 81% \nof the dose was recovered within 7 days in faeces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of dose). Unchanged \nimatinib accounted for 25% of the dose (5% urine, 20% faeces), the remainder being metabolites. \n \nPlasma pharmacokinetics \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the t\u00bd was approximately 18 h, suggesting that \nonce-daily dosing is appropriate. The increase in mean AUC with increasing dose was linear and dose \nproportional in the range of 25\u20131,000 mg imatinib after oral administration. There was no change in \nthe kinetics of imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation was 1.5\u20132.5-fold at steady state when \ndosed once daily. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis in CML patients, there was a small effect of age on the \nvolume of distribution (12% increase in patients > 65 years old). This change is not thought to be \nclinically significant. The effect of bodyweight on the clearance of imatinib is such that for a patient \n\n50 \n\n\n\nweighing 50 kg the mean clearance is expected to be 8.5 L/h, while for a patient weighing 100 kg the \nclearance will rise to 11.8 L/h. These changes are not considered sufficient to warrant dose adjustment \nbased on kg bodyweight. There is no effect of gender on the kinetics of imatinib. \n \nPharmacokinetics in paediatric population \nAs in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in paediatric patients in \nboth phase I and phase II studies. Dosing in children at 260 and 340 mg/m2/day achieved the same \nexposure, respectively, as doses of 400 mg and 600 mg in adult patients. The comparison of AUC(0-24) \non day 8 and day 1 at the 340 mg/m2/day dose level revealed a 1.7-fold drug accumulation after \nrepeated once-daily dosing. \n \nBased on pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis in paediatric patients with haematological \ndisorders (CML, Ph+ALL, or other haematological disorders treated with imatinib), clearance of \nimatinib increases with increasing body surface area (BSA). After correcting for the BSA effect, other \ndemographics such as age, body weight and body mass index did not have clinically significant effects \non the exposure of imatinib. The analysis confirmed that exposure of imatinib in paediatric patients \nreceiving 260 mg/m2 once daily (not exceeding 400 mg once daily) or 340 mg/m2 once daily (not \nexceeding 600 mg once daily) were similar to those in adult patients who received imatinib 400 mg or \n600 mg once daily. \n \nOrgan function impairment \nImatinib and its metabolites are not excreted via the kidney to a significant extent. Patients with mild \nand moderate impairment of renal function appear to have a higher plasma exposure than patients with \nnormal renal function. The increase is approximately 1.5- to 2-fold, corresponding to a 1.5-fold \nelevation of plasma AGP, to which imatinib binds strongly. The free drug clearance of imatinib is \nprobably similar between patients with renal impairment and those with normal renal function, since \nrenal excretion represents only a minor elimination pathway for imatinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nAlthough the results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is considerable inter-subject \nvariation, the mean exposure to imatinib did not increase in patients with varying degrees of liver \ndysfunction as compared to patients with normal liver function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of imatinib was assessed in rats, dogs, monkeys and rabbits. \n \nMultiple dose toxicity studies revealed mild to moderate haematological changes in rats, dogs and \nmonkeys, accompanied by bone marrow changes in rats and dogs. \n \nThe liver was a target organ in rats and dogs. Mild to moderate increases in transaminases and slight \ndecreases in cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein and albumin levels were observed in both species. \nNo histopathological changes were seen in rat liver. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated \nfor 2 weeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct \nhyperplasia. \n \nRenal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralisation and dilation of \nthe renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were \nobserved in several of these animals. In rats, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the renal \npapilla and in the urinary bladder was observed at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg in the 13-week study, without \nchanges in serum or urinary parameters. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed \nwith chronic imatinib treatment. \n \nIn a 39-week monkey study, no NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) was established at the \nlowest dose of 15 mg/kg, approximately one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg based on \nbody surface. Treatment resulted in worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these \nanimals. \n \n\n51 \n\n\n\nImatinib was not considered genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in \nvitro mammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus test. Positive \ngenotoxic effects were obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster \novary) for clastogenicity (chromosome aberration) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two \nintermediates of the manufacturing process, which are also present in the final product, are positive for \nmutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma \nassay. \n \nIn a study of fertility, in male rats dosed for 70 days prior to mating, testicular and epididymal weights \nand percent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately equal to the maximum clinical \ndose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. This was not seen at doses \u2264 20 mg/kg. A slight to \nmoderate reduction in spermatogenesis was also observed in the dog at oral doses \u2265 30 mg/kg. When \nfemale rats were dosed 14 days prior to mating and through to gestational day 6, there was no effect on \nmating or on number of pregnant females. At a dose of 60 mg/kg, female rats had significant post-\nimplantation foetal loss and a reduced number of live foetuses. This was not seen at doses \u2264 20 mg/kg. \n \nIn an oral pre- and postnatal development study in rats, red vaginal discharge was noted in the \n45 mg/kg/day group on either day 14 or day 15 of gestation. At the same dose, the number of stillborn \npups as well as those dying between postpartum days 0 and 4 was increased. In the F1 offspring, at the \nsame dose level, mean body weights were reduced from birth until terminal sacrifice and the number \nof litters achieving criterion for preputial separation was slightly decreased. F1 fertility was not \naffected, while an increased number of resorptions and a decreased number of viable foetuses was \nnoted at 45 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for both the maternal animals and the F1 \ngeneration was 15 mg/kg/day (one quarter of the maximum human dose of 800 mg). \n \nImatinib was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses \u2265 100 mg/kg, \napproximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day, based on body surface area. \nTeratogenic effects included exencephaly or encephalocele, absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal \nbones. These effects were not seen at doses \u2264 30 mg/kg. \n \nNo new target organs were identified in the rat juvenile development toxicology study (day 10 to 70 \npostpartum) with respect to the known target organs in adult rats. In the juvenile toxicology study, \neffects upon growth, delay in vaginal opening and preputial separation were observed at \napproximately 0.3 to 2 times the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of \n340 mg/m2. In addition, mortality was observed in juvenile animals (around weaning phase) at \napproximately 2 times the average paediatric exposure at the highest recommended dose of \n340 mg/m2. \n \nIn the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study administration of imatinib at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day resulted \nin a statistically significant reduction in the longevity of males at 60 mg/kg/day and females at \n\u2265 30 mg/kg/day. Histopathological examination of decedents revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), \nchronic progressive nephropathy (females) and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death \nor reasons for sacrifice. Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys, urinary bladder, \nurethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands and non-\nglandular stomach. \n \nPapilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland were noted from 30 mg/kg/day onwards, \nrepresenting approximately 0.5 or 0.3 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day \nor 800 mg/day, respectively, and 0.4 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at \n340 mg/m2/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) was 15 mg/kg/day. The renal \nadenoma/carcinoma, the urinary bladder and urethra papilloma, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, \nthe parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and malignant medullary tumours of the adrenal glands \nand the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas were noted at 60 mg/kg/day, representing \napproximately 1.7 or 1 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, \nrespectively, and 1.2 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2/day. The no \nobserved effect level (NOEL) was 30 mg/kg/day. \n \n\n52 \n\n\n\nThe mechanism and relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans are not yet \nclarified. \n \nNon-neoplastic lesions not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, \npancreas, endocrine organs and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and \ndilatation, leading to signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals. \n \nThe active substance imatinib demonstrates an environmental risk for sediment organisms. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n74 \n\n\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nImatinib Actavis 50 mg hard capsules \nimatinib \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nImatinib Actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of \ncancer. \n \nImatinib Actavis is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white \n\ncells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia \nin which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Actavis can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). \n\nLeukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight \ninfection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal \nwhite cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells. \n\n \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood \n\ndiseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These \nare blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. \nImatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n75 \n\n\n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin \nin which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these \ncells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases.  \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Actavis works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Actavis \n \nImatinib Actavis will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information \ncontained in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Actavis \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Actavis, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nYou may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Actavis. It is important to cover sun-\nexposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are \nalso applicable to children. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Actavis, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Actavis may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Actavis, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is \nworking. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with \nCML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very \nlimited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Actavis may have slower than normal growth. The \ndoctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Actavis \n\n76 \n\n\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including \nherbal medicines (such as St. John\u2019s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib \nActavis when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Actavis, either \nleading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Actavis less effective. Imatinib Actavis may do \nthe same to some other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n- Imatinib Actavis is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Actavis \nduring pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n\n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Actavis. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Actavis are advised to \n\nconsult with their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Actavis \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Actavis because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib \nActavis can help you to fight this condition. \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important \nthat you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Actavis unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nHow much Imatinib Actavis to take \n \nUse in adults \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to take. \n \n- If you are being treated for CML: \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 12 capsules once a day. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. If your \ndaily dose is 800 mg (16 capsules), you should take 8 capsules in the morning and 8 capsules in the \nevening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 12 capsules once a day. \n\n77 \n\n\n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 8 capsules once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL: \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as 2 capsules once a day. Your doctor may decide to \nincrease the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 8 capsules once a day, depending on how you \nrespond to treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP: \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (16 capsules), to be taken as 8 capsules in the morning and \n8 capsules in the evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Actavis given will depend on your child\u2019s condition, body weight and height. \nThe total daily dose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The \ntreatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be \nsplit into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Actavis \n- Take Imatinib Actavis with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Actavis. \n- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water. Do not open or crush the capsules \n\nunless you have difficulty in swallowing (e.g. in children). \n- If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you can open them up and pour the powder into a \n\nglass of still water or apple juice. \n- If you are a woman who is pregnant or might get pregnant and are trying to open the capsules, \n\nyou should handle the contents with caution in order to avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation. \nYou should wash your hands immediately after opening the capsules. \n\n \nHow long to take Imatinib Actavis \nKeep taking Imatinib Actavis every day for as long as your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Actavis than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Actavis \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next \n\ndose, skip the missed dose. \n- Then continue with your normal schedule. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nImatinib Actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of \ncancer. \n \nImatinib Actavis is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white \n\ncells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia \nin which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Actavis can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). \n\nLeukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight \ninfection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal \nwhite cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells. \n\n \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood \n\ndiseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These \nare blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. \nImatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n83 \n\n\n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin \nin which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these \ncells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Actavis works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Actavis \n \nImatinib Actavis will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information \ncontained in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Actavis \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Actavis, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nYou may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Actavis. It is important to cover sun-\nexposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are \nalso applicable to children. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Actavis, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Actavis may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Actavis, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is \nworking. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with \nCML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very \nlimited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Actavis may have slower than normal growth. The \ndoctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Actavis \n\n84 \n\n\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including \nherbal medicines (such as St. John\u2019s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib \nActavis when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Actavis, either \nleading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Actavis less effective. Imatinib Actavis may do \nthe same to some other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n- Imatinib Actavis is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Actavis \nduring pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n\n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Actavis. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Actavis are advised to \n\nconsult with their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Actavis \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Actavis because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib \nActavis can help you to fight this condition. \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important \nthat you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Actavis unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nHow much Imatinib Actavis to take \n \nUse in adults \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to take. \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. If your \ndaily dose is 800 mg (8 capsules), you should take 4 capsules in the morning and 4 capsules in the \nevening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day. \n\n85 \n\n\n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg to be taken as 4 capsules once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL: \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one capsule once a day. Your doctor may decide to \nincrease the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day, depending on how you \nrespond to treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP: \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (8 capsules), to be taken as 4 capsules in the morning and \n4 capsules in the evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Actavis given will depend on your child\u2019s condition, body weight and height. \nThe total daily dose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The \ntreatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be \nsplit into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Actavis \n- Take Imatinib Actavis with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Actavis. \n- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water. Do not open or crush the capsules \n\nunless you have difficulty in swallowing (e.g. in children). \n- If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you can open them up and pour the powder into a \n\nglass of still water or apple juice. \n- If you are a woman who is pregnant or might get pregnant and are trying to open the capsules, \n\nyou should handle the contents with caution in order to avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation. \nYou should wash your hands immediately after opening the capsules. \n\n \nHow long to take Imatinib Actavis \nKeep taking Imatinib Actavis every day for as long as your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Actavis than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Actavis \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next \n\ndose, skip the missed dose. \n- Then continue with your normal schedule. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nImatinib Actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of \ncancer. \n \nImatinib Actavis is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white \n\ncells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia \nin which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control.  \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Actavis can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). \n\nLeukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight \ninfection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal \nwhite cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells. \n\n \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood \n\ndiseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These \nare blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. \nImatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases.  \n\n91 \n\n\n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin \nin which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these \ncells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases.  \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Actavis works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Actavis \n \nImatinib Actavis will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information \ncontained in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Actavis \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Actavis, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nYou may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Actavis. It is important to cover sun-\nexposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are \nalso applicable to children. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Actavis, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Actavis may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Actavis, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is \nworking. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with \nCML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very \nlimited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Actavis may have slower than normal growth. The \ndoctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Actavis \n\n92 \n\n\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including \nherbal medicines (such as St. John\u2019s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib \nActavis when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Actavis, either \nleading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Actavis less effective. Imatinib Actavis may do \nthe same to some other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n- Imatinib Actavis is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Actavis \nduring pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n\n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Actavis. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Actavis are advised to \n\nconsult with their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Actavis \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Actavis because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib \nActavis can help you to fight this condition. \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important \nthat you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Actavis unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nHow much Imatinib Actavis to take \n \nUse in adults \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to take. \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg plus 2 capsules of \n100 mg once a day. \n\n \nYour doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to the treatment. If \nyour daily dose is 800 mg (2 capsules), you should take one capsule in the morning and a second \ncapsule in the evening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: \n\n93 \n\n\n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg plus 2 capsules of 100 mg \nonce a day.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg to be taken as one capsule once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL: \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one capsule of 100 mg once a day. Your doctor may \ndecide to increase the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as one capsule of 400 mg once a day, \ndepending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP: \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (2 capsules), to be taken as one capsule in the morning and a second \ncapsule in the evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many capsules of Imatinib Actavis to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Actavis given will depend on your child\u2019s condition, body weight and height.  \n \nThe total daily dose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The \ntreatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be \nsplit into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Actavis \n- Take Imatinib Actavis with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Actavis. \n- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water. Do not open or crush the capsules \n\nunless you have difficulty in swallowing (e.g. in children).  \n- If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you can open them up and pour the powder into a \n\nglass of still water or apple juice.  \n- If you are a woman who is pregnant or might get pregnant and are trying to open the capsules, \n\nyou should handle the contents with caution in order to avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation. \nYou should wash your hands immediately after opening the capsules.  \n\n \nHow long to take Imatinib Actavis \nKeep taking Imatinib Actavis every day for as long as your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Actavis than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Actavis \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next \n\ndose, skip the missed dose. \n- Then continue with your normal schedule. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nImatinib Actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of \ncancer. \n \nImatinib Actavis is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white \n\ncells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia \nin which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Actavis can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). \n\nLeukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight \ninfection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal \nwhite cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells. \n\n \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood \n\ndiseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These \nare blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. \nImatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n99 \n\n\n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin \nin which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these \ncells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Actavis works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Actavis \n \nImatinib Actavis will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information \ncontained in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to imatinib, soya, peanut or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Actavis \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Actavis, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nYou may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Actavis. It is important to cover sun-\nexposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are \nalso applicable to children. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Actavis, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Actavis may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Actavis, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is \nworking. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with \nCML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very \nlimited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Actavis may have slower than normal growth. The \ndoctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Actavis \n\n100 \n\n\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including \nherbal medicines (such as St. John\u2019s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib \nActavis when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Actavis, either \nleading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Actavis less effective. Imatinib Actavis may do \nthe same to some other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n- Imatinib Actavis is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Actavis \nduring pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n\n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Actavis. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Actavis are advised to \n\nconsult with their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains lecithin (soya) \nIf you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Actavis \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Actavis because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib \nActavis can help you to fight this condition. \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important \nthat you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Actavis unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nHow much Imatinib Actavis to take \n \nUse in adults \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Imatinib Actavis to take. \n \n- If you are being treated for CML:  \n\nThe usual starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 tablets once a day. \n \n\nYour doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. If your \ndaily dose is 800 mg (8 tablets), you should take 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening. \n \n\n101 \n\n\n\n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: \nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 tablets once a day.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg to be taken as 4 tablets once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL: \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one tablet once a day. Your doctor may decide to \nincrease the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 4 tablets once a day, depending on how you respond \nto treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP: \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (8 tablets), to be taken as 4 tablets in the morning and 4 tablets in \nthe evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many tablets of Imatinib Actavis to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Actavis given will depend on your child\u2019s condition, body weight and height. \n \nThe total daily dose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The \ntreatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be \nsplit into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Actavis \n- Take Imatinib Actavis with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Actavis. \n \n- Swallow the tablets whole with a large glass of water. \n The tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nIf you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can dissolve them in a glass of still or mineral water or \napple juice: \n- Use about 50 ml for each 100 mg tablet. \n- Stir with a spoon until the tablets have completely dissolved. \n- Once the tablet has dissolved, drink everything in the glass straight away. Traces of the \n\ndissolved tablets may be left behind in the glass. \n \nHow long to take Imatinib Actavis \nKeep taking Imatinib Actavis every day for as long as your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Actavis than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Actavis \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next \n\ndose, skip the missed dose. \n- Then continue with your normal schedule. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imatinib Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nImatinib Actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by \ninhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of \ncancer. \n \nImatinib Actavis is a treatment for: \n \n- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white \n\ncells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia \nin which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. \n\n \nIn adult patients, Imatinib Actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast \ncrisis). In children and adolescents, Imatinib Actavis can be used in different phases of the disease \n(chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). \n \n- Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). \n\nLeukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight \ninfection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal \nwhite cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells. \n\n \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for adults for: \n \n- Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood \n\ndiseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the \ngrowth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These \nare blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. \nImatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. \n\n107 \n\n\n\n- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin \nin which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Actavis inhibits the growth of these \ncells. \n\n \nIn the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. \n \nIf you have any questions about how Imatinib Actavis works or why this medicine has been prescribed \nfor you, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Imatinib Actavis \n \nImatinib Actavis will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood \ncancers or solid tumours. \n \nFollow all your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information \ncontained in this leaflet. \n \nDo not take Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to imatinib, soya, peanut or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nIf you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis: \n- if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. \n- if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. \n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Actavis \n\ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Actavis, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Actavis. \n \nYou may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Actavis. It is important to cover sun-\nexposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are \nalso applicable to children. \n \nDuring treatment with Imatinib Actavis, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very \nquickly. Imatinib Actavis may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). \n \nWhile you are taking Imatinib Actavis, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is \nworking. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nImatinib Actavis is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with \nCML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very \nlimited experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP and HES/CEL. \n \nSome children and adolescents taking Imatinib Actavis may have slower than normal growth. The \ndoctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. \n \nOther medicines and Imatinib Actavis \n\n108 \n\n\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including \nherbal medicines (such as St. John\u2019s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib \nActavis when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Actavis, either \nleading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Actavis less effective. Imatinib Actavis may do \nthe same to some other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n- Imatinib Actavis is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm \n\nyour baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Actavis \nduring pregnancy. \n\n- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n\n- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Actavis. \n- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Actavis are advised to \n\nconsult with their doctor. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains lecithin (soya) \nIf you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product. \n \nImatinib Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Imatinib Actavis \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Imatinib Actavis because you suffer from a serious condition. Imatinib \nActavis can help you to fight this condition. \n \nHowever, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important \nthat you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDo not stop taking Imatinib Actavis unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the \nmedicine as your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor \nstraight away. \n \nHow much Imatinib Actavis to take \n \nUse in adults \nYour doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Imatinib Actavis to take. \n \n- If you are being treated for CML: \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg plus 2 tablets of \n100 mg once a day.  \n\n \n\n109 \n\n\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. If your \ndaily dose is 800 mg (2 tablets), you should take one tablet in the morning and a second in the \nevening. \n \n- If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: \n\nThe starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg plus 2 tablets of 100 mg once a \nday.  \n\n \n- If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: \n\nThe starting dose is 400 mg to be taken as one tablet once a day. \n \n- If you are being treated for HES/CEL: \n\nThe starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one tablet of 100 mg once a day. Your doctor may \ndecide to increase the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as one tablet of 400 mg once a day, \ndepending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n \n- If you are being treated for DFSP: \n\nThe dose is 800 mg per day (2 tablets), to be taken as one tablet in the morning and a second \ntablet in the evening. \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe doctor will tell you how many tablets of Imatinib Actavis to give to your child. The amount of \nImatinib Actavis given will depend on your child\u2019s condition, body weight and height. \nThe total daily dose in children must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The \ntreatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be \nsplit into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). \n \nWhen and how to take Imatinib Actavis \n- Take Imatinib Actavis with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when \n\ntaking Imatinib Actavis. \n \n- Swallow the tablets whole with a large glass of water.  \n The score line is not intended for breaking the tablet. \n \nIf you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can dissolve them in a glass of still or mineral water or \napple juice: \n Use about 200 ml for each 400 mg tablet. \n- Stir with a spoon until the tablets have completely dissolved. \n- Once the tablet has dissolved, drink everything in the glass straight away. Traces of the \n\ndissolved tablets may be left behind in the glass. \n \nHow long to take Imatinib Actavis \nKeep taking Imatinib Actavis every day for as long as your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you take more Imatinib Actavis than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require \nmedical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Imatinib Actavis \n- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next \n\ndose, skip the missed dose. \n- Then continue with your normal schedule. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n110 \n\n\n\n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what imatinib actavis is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "imatinib actavis is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. this medicine works by inhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. these include some types of cancer. imatinib actavis is a treatment for: - chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml). leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. these white cells usually help the body to fight infection. chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. in adult patients, imatinib actavis is intended for use in the most advanced phase of the disease (blast crisis). in children and adolescents, imatinib actavis can be used in different phases of the disease (chronic, accelerated phase and blast crisis). - philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ph-positive all). leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. these white cells usually help the body to fight infection. acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal white cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. imatinib actavis inhibits the growth of these cells. imatinib actavis is also a treatment for adults for: - myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (mds/mpd). these are a group of blood diseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. imatinib actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. - hypereosinophilic syndrome (hes) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (cel). these are blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. imatinib actavis inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. - dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (dfsp). dfsp is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in which some cells start growing out of control. imatinib actavis inhibits the growth of these cells. in the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. if you have any questions about how imatinib actavis works or
